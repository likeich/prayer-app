ENGLISH  VERSION  OF  PATRIARCH'S  ENDORSEMENT 

THE  PATRIARCH  OF  MOSCOW 
AND  OF  ALL  RUSSIA 
TIKHON 
Trinity  Patriarchal  House,  Moscow 
November  3,  192 1 
No.  793 

To  the  AMERICAN  YOUNG  MEN'S  CHRISTIAN  ASSOCIATION,  Berlin. 
Grace  to  you  and  Peace  from  God  the  Father  and  from  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ. 

We  are  profoundly  touched  by  your  noble  and  truly  Christian  desire 
and  decision  to  re-publish  that  worthy  work,  "The  Orthodox  Service 
Book,"  the  fruit  of  many  years  of  labour  on  the  part  of  Miss  Isabel  F. 
Hapgood. 

With  prayerful  and  whole-souled  sincerity  We  invoke  God's  all- 
effectual  blessing  upon  this  pious  undertaking,  which  has  for  its  object 
the  spreading  abroad  upon  earth  of  the  faith  of  Christ,  and  aiding  the 
living  communion  of  believers  in  Christ  with  our  Lord  and  Saviour,  who 
is  marvellous  in  His  Saints;  and  We  wish  abundant  success  and  joy  in  the 
Holy  Spirit  to  all  who  shall  labour  in  this  great  work. 

We  express  the  joyful  conviction  that  in  the  execution  of  the  work  thus 
undertaken,  Dr.  John  R.  Mott,  whom  I  highly  esteem,  and  his  associates, 
will  accord  their  favourable  consideration  to  Miss  Hapgood,  and  will  invite 
her  valuable  and  helpful  assistance  in  the  task  of  correcting  the  inaccura- 
cies, omissions  and  typographical  errors  that  occurred  in  the  first  edition, 
of  which,  as  We  well  know,  she  has  already  prepared  a  special  record,  for 
use  in  case  a  second  edition  should  be  issued. 

Glory  be  unto  God  for  all  things! 

Committing  unto  His  provident  will  the  completion  of  the  work  which 
has  been  undertaken  to  His  Glory,  We  shall  account  Ourselves  happy  if 
the  Lord  shall  grant  Us  the  spiritual  solace  of  hearing,  while  We  are  still 
among  the  living,  that  this  book,  so  indispensable  for  understanding  the 
teachings  of  the  Holy  Orthodox  Apostolic  Church,  is  published  as  an  evi- 
dence of  the  zeal  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  for  the  pro- 
claiming abroad  of  the  truth  of  Christ. 

Our  Patriarchal  Blessing  be  upon  Our  American  flock,  always  so  near  to 
Our  heart;  and  upon  Our  never-to-be-forgotten  American  friends,  and 
unto  you  all.  Our  Patriarchal  Blessing  and  prayerful  greeting! 

(I   F   H)  TIKHON 

'  Patriarch  of  Moscow  and  of  all  Russia 


PREFACE  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION  OF  THE 

SERVICE  BOOK 

Had  communications  with  Moscow  been  less  complicated,  His  Holi- 
ness, Patriarch  Tikhon  would  have  received  a  complete  set  of  the  new 
proofs  for  his  inspection.  On  January  ist  (the  14th  N.S.),  1917-  I  dis- 
cussed with  him,  in  Petrograd  — ■  he  being  then  Archbishop  of  Vilna  and 
Lithuania  —  the  possibility  of  a  much  needed  new  edition ,  my  own  efforts 
to  secure  such  an  edition  and  a  list  of  corrections  which  I  had  already 
prepared.  The  first  edition  was  prepared  and  published  under  his  super- 
vision, while  he  was  at  the  head  of  The  American  Mission,  as  Archbishop 
of  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  North  America. 

From  beginning  to  end  the  preparation  of  this  second  edition  of  The 
Service  Book  has  been  unreservedly  and  exclusively  entrusted  to  me  by 
the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association.  I  have  made  no  changes  whatso- 
ever, beyond  the  correction  of  accidental  errors  and  omissions  —  none  of 
them  important  —  natural  in  the  first  edition  of  an  exceedingly  difficult 
work;  with  one  exception: 

The  word  "Ruler"  has  been  substituted  for  any  more  specific  title  in 
the  prayers,  litanies  and  hymns.  This  renders  it  easy  for  any  one  of  the 
score  of  autonomous  churches  belonging  to  the  Eastern  Orthodox  Con- 
fession to  supply  the  appropriate  Official  title  for  the  head  of  the  State, 
wherever  occasion  may  be  found  to  use  this  version  at  their  wonderful 
services. 

The  Services,  as  herein  set  forth,  are  regularly  and  officially  used,  with 
unimportant  local  differences,  in  all  the  branches  of  the  Orthodox  Catho- 
lic Church.  They  are,  also,  used  in  one  branch  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church,  known  historically  as  the  "Uniat,"  or  "Greek-Catholic" 
(Roman  Catholic  of  the  Greek  Rite).  The  most  considerable  section  of 
this  Uniat  Church  is  that  which,  at  the  close  of  the  XVI.  century,  in 
South-West  (Little)  Russia,  broke  away  from  its  Mother  Church,  the 
Russian,  and  became  "Uniat"  by  recognizing  the  headship  of  Rome.  It 
has  retained  the  Old  Church  Slavonic  language  and  all  the  Service  Books 
of  the  Russian  Church ;  but  the  divergent  dogmas  and  most  of  the  customs 
of  the  Roman  Church  have  gradually  been  substituted  for  those  of  the 
Mother  Church.  Since  the  World  War  this  branch  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  has  adopted  the  title  of  "The  Ukrainian  Church."

PREFACE 

Some  explanation  is  necessary  touching  the  aim  and  scope  of  this 
Service  Book,  and  my  methods  in  compiling  it. 

It  has  always  been  the  policy  of  the  Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Apostolic 
Church  of  the  East  to  have  her  services  celebrated  in  the  languages  of 
the  countries  inhabited  by  her  members.  In  accordance  with  this  policy 
it  is  desired,  eventually,  to  make  English  the  language,  in  this  country, 
of  the  Russian  Church,  which  was  the  first  to  bring  Christianity  to 
Alaska,  and  now  has  more  parishes  in  all  sections  of  the  land  than 
either  of  the  other  representatives  of  that  Communion,  —  the  Greek 
and  Syro-Arabian  branches. 

Moreover,  the  adoption  of  the  English  language  is  the  sole  solution 
of  many  difficulties  encountered  by  the  priests  of  that  church  in  admin- 
istering to  the  spiritual  wants  of  their  flocks,  who  come  from  many 
countries,  each  of  which  has  its  own  language  or  dialect,  —  Great  Rus- 
sia, Little  Russia,  Galicia  (in  Eastern  Austria),  Hungary,  Servia, 
Montenegro,  Bulgaria,  Rumania,  Syria,  Greece,  and,  possibly,  other 
localities.  English  is  the  Pan-Slavonic  language  in  America,  as  Ger- 
man is  the  Pan-Slavonic  language  on  the  Continent  of  Europe.  The 
children  are  reared  in  our  American  public  schools,  as  a  rule,  and  it  will 
be  difficult  to  teach  them  their  church  services  in  the  original  tongue, 
under  the  prevailing  conditions.  An  English  version  of  the  services  is 
also  desirable  for  the  pupils  in  such  parish  schools  as  exist,  where  much 
attention  is  given  to  instruction  in  English. 

I  have  used  the  Old  Church-Slavonic  books  of  the  Russian  Church, 
rather  than  the  original  Greek,  because  my  work  has  been  done,  prima- 
rily, for  the  use  of  the  Russian  Church  in  America.  Slight  differences 
in  arrangement  and  practice  (not  in  dogma)  have  arisen  between  the 
Russian  Church  and  the  Greek  Church,  similar  to  those  between  the 
Church  of  England  and  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church  in  America. 
I  have  carefully  compared  everything  with  the  original  Greek. 

My  object  has  been  to  make  a  book  which  shall  show,  as  precisely 
and  clearly  as  possible,  all  the  services  in  general  use  ;  and  that  in  a 
manner  which  shall  be  practical,  not  only  for  the  ecclesiastics  who  are 
familiar  with  them  and  their  congregations,  but  also  "for  students  of 
Liturgies  and  for  travellers  in  the  various  lands  where  the  Orthodox 
Church  exists,  as  well  as  visitors  to  the  churches  in  America  and  in 
numerous  capitals  and  cities  of  Europe.  To  that  end  I  have  adopted  an 
arrangement  of  my  own  devising.  The  difficulty  and  intricacy  of  the 
undertaking  have  been  very  great,  owing  to  this  arrangement  and  to 
other  factors  in  the  case.    The  treasure  of  services  in  the  Orthodox- 


vi  PREFACE 

Catholic  Church  is  so  vast  and  so  rich  that  a  complete  version,  within  a 
reasonable,  convenient  compass,  is  utterly  out  of  the  question.  Accord- 
ingly, I  have  selected  those  services  which  are  generally  used,  and  in- 
clude, practically,  all  that  are  ordinarily  required.  For  instance,  I  have 
omitted  even  the  skeleton  of  such  services  as  the  Midnight  Service 
(Polunosktchnitza),  Little  Vespers,  the  Blessing  of  a  Ship  (at  launching), 
and  many  of  a  private  nature,  such  as  the  Blessing  of  a  Pectoral  Cross, 
the  Blessing  when  a  Well  is  dug,  and  so  forth. 

In  the  original  the  Litanies,  Prayers,  and  certain  of  the  Hymns  in 
the  unchanging  framework  of  the  Liturgies,  Vespers,  Compline,  and 
Matins  are  printed  consecutively.  The  movable  portions  and  specially 
appointed  Hymns  are  inserted  according  to  the  rubrics,  at  the  proper 
points,  from  various  other  volumes. 

I  have  combined  the  fixed  parts  and  have  arranged  them  in  such  way 
as  to  show  what  takes  place  simultaneously  within  the  Sanctuary  and 
outside.  I  have  also  indicated  the  usual  variations  during  Pontifical 
Services,  Feasts,  Fasts,  and  so  forth,  selecting  these  and  the  most 
important  representative  Hymns  for  various  occasions  from  the  numer- 
ous volumes  in  which  they  are  dispersed. 

For  the  sake  of  convenience,  I  have  combined  the  Liturgies  of  St.  John 
Chrysostom,  St.  Basil  the  Great,  and  the  Pontifical  Liturgy,  thus  avoid- 
ing repetition,  but  keeping  them  as  distinct,  otherwise,  as  in  the  original. 

I  have  been  obliged  to  leave  the  service  for  Vespers  almost  in  a 
skeleton  state,  as  it  appears  in  the  original  service  books  (instead  of 
filling  it  out,  as  in  the  case  of  the  other  services),  because  of  its  very 
great  flexibility,  which  causes  immensely  wide  variations  dependent 
upon  the  seasons  —  the  proximity  of  Fasts,  Feasts,  and  so  forth. 

If  in  actual  practice  it  shall  prove  desirable  to  have  the  more 
infrequent  services  (or  others,  which  are  abbreviated  here)  in  fuller 
form,  I  shall  endeavour  to  complete  them,  either  in  a  new  edition  of  the 
present  work,  should  there  be  a  demand  for  it,  or  in  special  volumes. 
In  that  case  I  shall  hope  to  take  advantage  of  all  competent  and 
unprejudiced  criticism  for  the  perfecting  of  a  book  which  has  long  been 
so  near  my  heart;  also  of  any  new  translation  into  the  Old  Church- 
Slavonic,  or  revised  edition  of  the  Russian  Service  Books.  In  several 
cases  I  have  preferred  for  this  volume  the  older,  rather  than  the  more 
recent,  editions. 

It  has  seemed  practical  and  advisable  to  retain  the  Slavonic  nomen- 
clature for  the  parts  of  the  service,  in  addition  to  the  corresponding 
English  terms.  Had  I  introduced  the  original  Greek  terms  also,  great 
confusion  would  have  ensued.  But  the  omission  of  the  Greek  is  unim- 
portant. Most  of  the  Slavonic  terms  are  sufficiently  near  those  from 
which  they  were  borrowed  to  make  comprehension  perfectly  easy.  In 
the  exceptional  cases  there  is  no  difficulty  in  determining  the  corre- 
spondence. Thus  the  book  will  be  as  useful  for  a  comprehension  of  the 
Greek  services  as  of  those  in  the  Slavonic  countries. 


PREFACE  vii 

There  have  been  two  or  three  previous  translations,  from  the  Greek 
or  Slavonic,  of  portions  of  these  services,  by  other  persons  than  myself. 
But  in  practice  they  have  proved  unsatisfactory,  either  in  language  or 
arrangement  or  both,  or  because  neither  singly  nor  combined  do  they 
furnish  the  services  in  that  completeness  which  is  imperatively  neces- 
sary.    My  aim  has  been  to  remedy  these  defects. 

A  list  of  the  service  books  which  have  entered  into  the  composition 
of  my  volume  will  afford  some  idea  of  the  difficulties  of  the  problem. 

(i)  The  Shizliebnik,  or  Service  Book,  which  contains  most  of  the 
fixed  portions  of  the  Liturgies  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  and  St.  Basil 
the  Great,  and  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  ;  also  the  Litanies  and  Prayers 
of  Vespers  and  Matins,  together  with  the  Graduals  and  Benedictions 
appropriate  to  all  occasions.     This  is  used  by  the  Priest  and  the  Choir. 

(2)  The  Tchdsoslov,  or  Book  of  the  Hours  (Horologion),  which  con- 
tains, in  addition  to  the  Hours  and  the  Typical  Psalms,  those  fixed  por- 
tions of  Vespers,  Compline,  Matins,  Midnight  Service,  and  so  forth, 
which  are  used  by  the  singers  and  the  readers ;  also  a  selection  of 
Hymns  for  various  occasions. 

(3)  The  Pontifical  Service  Book  (Tchinovnik),  which  contains  the 
fixed  portions  of  the  Liturgies  above  mentioned,  as  celebrated  by  a 
Bishop ;  together  with  all  the  Offices  of  Ordination,  ecclesiastical  pro- 
motion, the  blessing  of  an  Antimins  (corporal),  and  so  forth. 

(4)  The  Oktoikh,  or  Book  of  the  Eight  Tones,  which  contains  the 
Canons  and  certain  of  the  Hymns  used  during  Little  and  Great  Vespers, 
Compline,  Midnight  Service,  and  Matins ;  the  Hymn  for  the  Day  and 
the  Collect-Hymn  from  the  Canons  being  used  also  at  the  Liturgy  on 
the  following  morning.  There  are  eight  complete  sets  for  each  service 
mentioned,  for  every  day  in  the  week,  all  during  one  week  being  sung 
in  the  same  Tone. 

(5)  The  Monthly  Mineya,  in  twelve  volumes,  which  contain  the  order 
of  services  for  all  the  fixed  days  in  the  year  celebrating  some  special 
event  in  the  history  of  the  Faith  or  the  Church,  or  commemorating  a 
Saint  or  Saints.  All  the  Mineya  contain  the  Prayers  for  Vespers  and 
Matins,  while  some  have  special  Prayers  for  the  Hours,  Liturgies, 
Compline,  and  the  Midnight  Service. 

(6)  The  volume  known  as  the  Anthologion,  or  Prdzditclinaya  Minfya 
(Festival  Mineya)  contains  the  Services  for  the  Twelve  Great  Feasts. 

(7)  The  Fasting  Triodion  (Postnaya  Triod)  contains  the  variable 
portions  of  the  services  on  the  movable  days  which  constitute  the  pre- 
paration for  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  and  during  the  entire  Great  Fast. 
It  is  so  called  because  the  Canons  have  only  Three  Odes  (or  Theme- 
Songs),  instead  of  the  customary  nine  —  practically  eight  —  which  are 
in  the  Book  of  the  Eight  Tones  {Oktoikh). 

(8)  The  Tzvyetndya  Triod  (Flowery  Triodion),  or  Penticostdrion, 
contains  the  order  of  services  during  Easter-tide,  beginning  with  Easter 
and  ending  with  Pentecost,  including  the  following    day,  —  Whitsun 


vm  PREFACE 

Monday,  —  which  is  the  real  Pentecost,  or  Day  of  the  Spirit,  Sunday 
being  called  Trinity  Day. 

(9)  The  Apostol  contains  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  the  Epistles,  and 
the  Graduals,  Introits  and  Anthems  for  the  Feasts. 

For  their  guidance  in  the  use  of  these  complicated  volumes  the 
ecclesiastics  have  a  volume  entitled  the  Typikon,  Ustdv,  or  Rule,  which 
provides  regulations  for  all  possible  contingencies. 

(10)  The  Great  Trebnik,  or  Book  of  Needs,  which  contains  all  the 
Sacraments  (except  the  Holy  Communion  and  Ordination),  —  Baptism, 
Chrismation,  Confession,  Matrimony,  Unction  of  the  Sick ;  together 
with  various  other  services,  such  as  the  Reception  of  Converts  from 
various  other  Churches,  the  Tonsure  of  Monks,  and  so  forth ;  also 
private  services,  such  as  Prayers  at  the  Birth  of  a  Child,  the  several 
Funeral  Services,  the  Consecration  of  a  Church,  the  Blessing  of  a  New 
Dwelling,  and  so  forth. 

(11)  A  Book  of  Te  Deums  and  Prayer  Services  (Moliibny)  for  dif- 
ferent occasions. 

(12)  The  Irmologion,  which  contains  the  Theme-Songs  of  the  Canons, 
and  certain  Services  of  Song  in  honour  of  Our  Lord,  the  Birth-giver  of 
God,  St.  Nicholas,  and  others. 

It  will  be  seen  that  I  have  been  confronted  with  the  problem  of  re- 
jection, as  well  as  of  judicious  selection.  I  may  add,  that  many  things 
are  done  or  said  "by  custom  "  which  are  not  mentioned  in  the  printed 
books.    These  I  have  included. 

I  have  used  the  King  James  version  of  the  Bible  for  the  Scripture 
lessons  ;  and  the  Psalter  contained  in  the  Book  of  Common  Prayer  for 
the  Psalms  and  Verses,  with  occasional  exceptions,  when  the  exigencies 
of  the  Slavonic  version  or  adaptation  to  special  cases  or  services  re- 
quired slight  changes. 

My  book  has  been  revised  by  a  very  able  and  thoroughly  competent 
priest,  to  whom  I  am  greatly  indebted  for  indispensable  services  in 
supplying  me  with  the  unrecorded  points  of  the  ritual  (established  by 
usage)  referred  to  above,  and  for  making  sure  that  I  have  accurately 
expressed  the  dogmas  of  his  Church,  and  have  properly  carried  out  the 
complicated  arrangement  entailed  by  my  plan  for  rendering  the  services 
intelligible. 

I  alone  am  personally  responsible  for  everything  :  the  suggestion 
that  the  book  was  needed,  and  the  plan  without  which  it  would  have 
been  impossible ;  for  the  execution  ;  for  occasional  invented  words,  and 
for  the  language,  in  general  and  in  particular,  except  in  the  case  of  the 
incomparable  rendering  of  the  Prayer  of  St.  Chrysostom,  which  I  have 
taken  from  the  Episcopal  Book  of  Common  Prayer  ;  and  of  course  the 
passages  from  the  Bible,  as  above  stated. 

His  Grace,  the  Most  Reverend  Tikhon,  Archbishop  of  North  Amer- 
ica and  the  Aleutian  Islands,  has,  by  his  deep  interest  and  practical  aid, 
been  of  inestimable  service,  and  I  thank  him  most  warmly. 


PREFACE  ix 

His  High  Excellency,  K.  P  Pobyedonostzeff,  fortnerly  Procurator  of 
the  Holy  Synod  of  Russia,  has  for  years  past  shown  sympathetic  and 
practical  interest  in  my  work,  which  has  encouraged  me  during  serious 
difficulties,  and  has  been  profoundly  appreciated. 

The  Holy  Synod  of  Russia  has  defrayed  in  part  the  cost  of  publish- 
ing this  volume  ;  and  his  High  Excellency  Count  Sergius  I.  Witte  has 
contributed  very  liberally  to  this  object.1 1  am  sincerely  grateful  to  them. 

I  wish,  also,  to  express  my  obligations  to  the  late  mitred  Archpriest, 
Father  Feodor  Pavlovitch,  of  Tzarskoe  Selo,  for  many  books  and  much 
important  information.    Memory  Eternal ! 

It  is  fitting  that  I  should  commemorate  last  of  all  my  book's  first 
friend,  —  his  Grace,  the  Most  Reverend  Archbishop  Nicholas,  formerly 
Bishop  of  Aleutia  and  Alaska,  now  appointed  a  member  of  the  Council 
of  the  Empire,  and  of  the  Holy  Synod.  He  was  the  first  person  to 
whom  I  imparted  my  intention  of  making  this  gift  of  love  to  his 
Church,  the  first  to  see  and  to  approve  of  my  systematic  arrangement 
and  of  the  manuscript.  He  gave  me  a  complete  set  of  the  valuable 
Slavonic  Service  Books  above  mentioned,  and  others,  and  has  constantly 
used  his  power  to  the  fullest  extent  to  render  possible  this  publication, 
affording  me,  meanwhile,  the  invaluable  help  of  his  fervent  sympathy 
in  my  long  and  difficult  task.2 

To  all  these  friends  I  now  say,  with  sincerest  gratitude,  in  the  lan- 
guage of  the  Church  which  they  love  so  well,  Many  Years  ! 

It  is  my  earnest  hope  that  this  Service  Book  may  not  only  be  of  some 
use  to  the  Russian  Church  in  North  America,  for  the  use  of  which,  in 
public  worship,  it  is  designed,  but  that  it  may  help  the  other  Churches 
—  especially  those  of  the  Anglican  Communion,  to  one  of  which  I  am 
myself  attached  —  to  a  right  understanding  of  the  Holy  Orthodox-

THE    FEASTS    AND    FASTS    OF    THE    CHURCH  xvii 


THE   FASTS   AND    SEASONS   OF   THE   CHURCH 

The  Movable  Feasts  and  two  Fasts  are  regulated  by  the  date  upon 
which  Easter  falls.  At  times  this  coincides  with  its  date  in  the  West- 
ern Church.    See  the  table  for  Easter,  page  xxi. 

The  Great  Fast  (Lent)  begins  on  Monday ;  not,  as  in  the  Western 
Church,  on  Ash  Wednesday.  (There  is  no  Ash  Wednesday.)  It  lasts 
for  forty-eight  days.  As  a  chieftain,  before  the  battle,  encourages  his 
warriors  with  wise  and  timely  words,  so  the  Church  prepares  us  in 
advance  for  feats  of  fasting  and  penitence,  and  then  bids  us  to  the  per- 
formance of  those  feats.  This  preparation  begins  on  the  Sunday  pre- 
ceding that  which  is  known  in  the  Western  Church  as  Septuagesima 
Sunday,  and  is  called  "The  Sunday  of  the  Publican  and  the  Pharisee." 
Because  pride,  conceit  of  one's  own  righteousness,  and  scorn  of  his 
neighbour  is  the  first  and  chiefest  obstacle  to  repentance,  the  Church 
has  appointed  the  condemnation  of  this  sin  as  the  theme  of  her  hymns 
and  readings  on  that  day,  taking  the  Gospel  narrative  of  the  Publican 
and  the  Pharisee  as  the  key-note. 

In  like  manner,  the  next  week  of  preparation  (coinciding  with  Sep- 
tuagesima Sunday)  is  called  after  the  Prodigal  Son,  and  the  sinner  is 
reminded  that,  when  he  scrupulously  examines  his  evil  deeds,  he  will 
perceive  how  deeply  he  has  offended  God.  Hence  he  is  encouraged  to 
repentance  and  confession.  The  Prodigal  Son  is  made  the  theme  of 
the  hymns  and  readings  for  the  day. 

On  the  Saturday  preceding  the  following  Meat-fast  Sunday  a  Re- 
quiem Liturgy  is  celebrated  for  all  Orthodox  believers  departed  this 
life,  who  are  awaiting  the  Last  Judgment.  Therefore  this  Saturday  is 
known  as  "  Ancestors'  Saturday." 

On  the  Sunday  corresponding  to  Sexagesima  Sunday  begins  the 
Meat-fast  Week.  After  this  day  no  more  meat  may  be  eaten.  The 
Second  Coming  of  the  Lord,  founded  upon  the  Lesson  from  the  Gospel 
about  the  Last  Judgment,  is  the  special  theme  of  this  Sunday  :  in  order 
that  the  sinner  may  not  fall  into  carelessness  concerning  his  salvation 
through  too  secure  a  trust  in  the  ineffable  loving-kindness  of  God,  but 
may  call  to  mind  that  the  Lord  God  is  also  a  righteous  Judge. 

After  the  Sunday  (corresponding  to  Quinquagesima)  on  which  begins 
the  Cheese  Fast,  no  more  cheese,  eggs,  butter,  or  milk  may  be  eaten. 
The  services  of  this  Sunday  aim  to  impress  upon  us  that  only  by  strict 
abstinence  can  we  hope  to  recover  that  Paradise  which  Adam  lost 
through  the  lack  of  abstinence.  Therefore  Adam,  fallen  and  banished, 
is  the  special  theme  of  the  Church.  It  is  customary  on  this  day  to  ask 
and  accord  mutual  forgiveness,  and  to  effect  mutual  reconciliation.  This 
custom  is  founded  on  the  words  of  Jesus  Christ  in  the  Gospel  lesson  for 
the  day  :  "  For  if  ye  forgive  men  their  trespasses,  your  heavenly  Father 


xviii  THE    FEASTS    AND    FASTS   OF    THE    CHURCH 

will  also  forgive  you."  Hence  it  is  generally  called  "  Forgiveness  Sun- 
day." 

More  reverences  to  the  earth  are  appointed  for  the  Great  Fast 
(Lent)  than  for  the  services  at  other  seasons,  and  the  penitential  char- 
acter of  the  Offices  is  augmented.  In  the  songs  and  prayers  the 
moan  of  the  contrite  soul,  bitterly  bewailing  its  sins,  is  audible.  The 
first  week  is  the  most  severe  of  all  as  to  restrictions  upon  food  and 
drink :  and  the  Offices  have  less  of  a  triumphal  and  festival  character 
than  during  the  remaining  weeks.  Hence,  during  the  Fast  the  full 
Liturgy  is  celebrated  only  on  Saturday  and  on  Sunday,  while  on  the 
remaining  days  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  is  used.  The 
strictest  fasting  is  prescribed,  although  the  Orthodox  Church  usually 
prescribes  abstinence  during  all  fasts,  not  only  from  meat,  but  also  from 
cheese,  eggs,  milk,  butter,  and  so  forth. 

On  the  evenings  of  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,  and  Thursday  of 
the  first  week  of  the  Great  Fast,  the  Great  Canon — the  Penitential 
Canon  —  of  St.  Andrew  of  Crete  is  read. 

The  first  Sunday  in  the  Great  Fast  is  known  as  "Orthodoxy  Sun- 
day," and  thereon  is  celebrated  the  triumph  of  the  Church  over  the 
Iconoclasts,  and  the  rees-tablishment  of  reverence  for  Holy  Pictures 
(Images  —  Ikoni),  in  the  year  842  ;  as  also  the  victory  of  the  Church  over 
other  heresies.  In  some  Cathedral  Churches  the  Office  of  Orthodoxy 
is  celebrated  by  the  Bishop  before  the  Divine  Liturgy,  or  near  the 
end  thereof.  In  this  Office  athletes  and  champions  of  Orthodoxy  are 
extolled,  and  Anathema  is  proclaimed  upon  their  opponents. 

On  the  third  Sunday,  and  during  the  week  which  follows,  is  celebrated 
the  Adoration  of  the  Holy  Cross,  which  is  brought  forth  from  the  Sanc- 
tuary for  the  refreshment  and  strengthening  of  the  faithful. 

On  the  evening  of  Saturday  in  the  Fifth  Week  is  chanted  the  Can- 
ticle (Akdfist)  of  the  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  in  especial  com- 
memoration of  her  aid  during  two  assaults  from  the  Saracens  upon 
Constantinople,  in  the  years  673  and  716. 

On  the  Saturday  before  Palm  Sunday  the  Church  commemorates  the 
resurrection  of  Lazarus,  wherein  the  Lord  Jesus  showed  forth  His  divine 
might  to  the  people  before  His  suffering  and  death  ;  thus  assuring  them 
of  His  own  Resurrection,  and  of  the  universal  Resurrection  of  all  the 
dead.  On  the  Eve  of  Lazarus's  Saturday  the  Great  Fast  proper  (called 
"the  Forty  Days  ")  comes  to  an  end,  and  on  the  Monday  next  follow- 
ing the  "  Fast  of  Christ's  Passions  "  begins,  lasting  until  Easter. 

OTHER    FASTS. 

On  Monday  after  the  Sunday  of  All  Saints,  which  follows  Pentecost, 
begins  the  Fast  of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul,  ending  on  June  29  (July  12, 
N.  S.).  The  length  of  this  fast  is  regulated  by  the  date  of  Easter  and 
of  Pentecost ;  and  therefore  it  varies  from  two  weeks  to  five  weeks  and 
five  days. 


THE    FEASTS   AND    FASTS    OF    THE   CHURCH  xix 

The  Fast  which  precedes  the  Feast  of  the  Falling-asleep  of  the  Holy 
Birth-giver  of  God  (called  "The  Assumption  "  in  the  Western  Church), 
on  August  15-28,  begins  on  August  1-14. 

The  Feast  of  the  Exaltation  of  the  Cross  (the  Setting-up),  that  of 
the  Beheading  of  St.  John  the  Forerunner,  and  the  Eve  of  the  Bap- 
tism of  Christ  (Epiphany),  are  reckoned  as  fasts.  (See  the  Table,  for  the 
dates). 

The  Fast  preparatory  to  Christmas,  corresponding  to  Advent,  is  called 
"The  Christmas  Fast,"  and  begins  on  November  15-28. 

In  addition  to  these  Chief  Fasts  and  the  Great  Fast,  all  Wednesdays 
and  Fridays  are  fast-days,  except  during  what  are  known  as  the  "  com- 
pact weeks;"  from  Christmas  to  the  Eve  (Fast)  of  the  Epiphany ;  the 
Week  between  the  Sunday  of  the  Publican  and  the  Pharisee  and  the 
Sunday  of  the  Prodigal  Son  ;  Meat-fast  Week,  when  cheese,  eggs,  and 
milk  are  permitted  ;  the  Bright  Easter  week ;  and  the  week  preceding 
the  Fast  of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul. 

The  joyous  character  of  the  Offices  at  the  great  Feast  of  Feasts, 
Easter,  can  be  seen  on  page  226. 

The  second  Sunday  after  Easter  Day  is  called  St.  Thomas's  Week,  or 
"  Anti-Paskha,"  from  the  Gospel  Lesson  for  the  day,  and  commemorates 
the  appearance  of  the  Lord  to  His  disciples  after  the  Resurrection,  and 
the  viewing  of  His  wounds  by  Thomas. 

The  third  Sunday  after  Easter  is  called  after  the  Myrrh-bearing  Wo- 
men, who  witnessed  the  burial  and  resurrection  of  Christ.  And  with 
them  are  commemorated  Joseph  of  Arimathea  and  Nicodemus.  Here, 
as  on  the  Sunday  which  precedes  and  the  Sundays  which  follow,  the 
special  title  is  derived  from  the  Gospel  Lesson  for  the  day. 

On  the  fourth  Sunday  is  commemorated  the  Impotent  Man  whom 
Christ  healed  at  the  Pool  of  Bethesda. 

The  Lesson  for  the  fifth  Sunday,  about  the  Woman  of  Samaria, 
shows  Jesus  Christ  as  One  who  knows  the  secrets  of  the  heart,  and  as 
the  true  Messiah. 

The  Sunday  of  the  Blind  Man  (the  sixth  after  Easter)  commemorates 
the  healing  by  Christ  of  the  man  who  was  born  blind. 

Ascension  Day  falls  on  the  following  Thursday,  and,  as  in  the  West- 
ern Church,  is  followed,  ten  days  later,  by  the  Feast  of  Pentecost. 
But  what  is  called  Whit-Sunday  in  the  Western  Church  is  Trinity 
Sunday  in  the  Eastern  Church,  and  the  next  day  is  The  Day  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  (or  Ghost),  that  is  Pentecost. 

The  seventh  Sunday  after  Easter  is  the  Day  of  the  Holy  Fathers  of 
the  Council  of  Nicsea. 

The  first  Sunday  after  Pentecost  is  All  Saints'  Day 


xx  THE    FEASTS    AND    FASTS    OF    THE    CHURCH 

TONES. 

There  are  eight  Plain  Chants,  or  Tones.  During  the  Bright  Easter 
week  the  Tone  changes  in  regular  order  every  day.  On  the  second 
Sunday  after  Trinity  Sunday  (Pentecost),  and  during  the  week  which 
follows,  the  First  Tone  is  used,  with  its  appointed  Gradual  (Prokimeu), 
Canon,  Hymns  {Tropari),  Verses  {Stikhera  of  the  Stikhovni),  Hymns 
to  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchni,  or  Dogmdtiki),  Collect- 
Hymn  {Konddk),  and  so  forth.  Thereafter  the  Tone  changes  on  each 
successive  Sunday,  until  all  eight  Tones  have  been  used.  On  the  tenth 
Sunday  after  Pentecost,  the  First  Tone  is  used  again ;  and  so  on, 
throughout  the  year. 


A  TABLE    TO   FIND   EASTER  DAY 

FROM  THE  YEAR  OF  OUR  LORD  1906  TO  THE  YEAR  OF  OUR  LORD 

2000,  INCLUSIVE 

Easter  Day,  on  which  all  the  Movable  Feasts  and  Holy-days  depend, 
is  the  first  Sunday  after  the  Full  Moon  which  happens  upon  or  next 
after  the  Twenty-first  of  March  ;  and  if  the  Full  Moon  happen  upon  a 
Sunday,  Easter  Day  is  the  Sunday  after.  This  is  the  same  rule  which 
is  used  in  the  Western  Church,  but  Easter  Day  does  not  always  coin- 
cide in  the  Holy  Catholic  Church  of  the  East  with  that  Feast  in  the 
Western  Church.  The  Eastern  Church  still  observes  the  rule  laid 
down  by  the  Council  of  Nicaea  (л.  d.  325),  and  now  disregarded  by  the 
Western  Church,  that  the  Christian  Easter  shall  never  either  precede 
or  coincide  with  the  Jewish  Passover,  but  must  always  follow  it.  Easter 
cannot  fall  earlier  than  March  23,  O.  S.,  or  later  than  April  25,  O.  S. 
The  Eastern  Church  still  uses  the  Julian  Calendar,  which,  since 
March  1,  1901,  has  been  thirteen  days  behind  the  Gregorian  Calendar. 

The  years  in  which  the  Easter  Feast  falls  on  the  same  day  in  the 
Eastern  and  the  Western  Churches  are  indicated  by  a  cross  in  the  fol- 
lowing Table.  The  Full  Moon  used  for  the  purposes  of  the  Easter 
reckoning  is  the  Fourteenth  Day  of  a  Lunar  Month  reckoned  according 
to  the  ancient  Ecclesiastical  computation,  and  not  the  real  Astronomical 
Full  Moon.

THE  SYMBOLISM  OF  THE  CHURCH* 


The  Exterior.  A  Temple  has  sometimes  a  single  dome,  sometimes 
many  domes.  One  dome  serves  as  a  symbol  of  the  One  Head  of  the 
Church,  Jesus  Christ.  Three  domes  typify  the  three  Persons  of  the 
Holy  Trinity.  Five  are  symbolical  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  the 
Four  Evangelists. 

Each  dome  —  and  where  there  is  no  dome  the  apex  of  the  Temple — ■ 
is  crowned  by  a  Cross,  the  emblem  of  victory 

Bells.  A  Belfry  is  generally  constructed  in  connection  with  the 
church,  either  in  a  separate  tower  or  in  one  of  the  domes.  The  direct 
use  of  the  belfry  is  to  summon  the  faithful  to  worship,  although  the 
rubric  concerning  the  use  of  the  different  bells  and  their  manner  of 
chiming  and  pealing  is  very  detailed  and  complicated.  It  is  impossible 
to  make  it  clear,  in  a  foreign  language,  to  those  who  are  not  personally 
acquainted  with  the  beautiful  Russian  bells,  which  are  treated  in  a  pecul- 
iar way,  wholly  unknown  in  the  Western  Church.  They  are  rung  at 
certain  points  in  the  service,  in  order  that  the  faithful  who,  for  any 
reason,  are  not  in  church,  may  unite  their  prayers  with  those  of  the 

worshippers  in  the  Temple 
at  the  most  solemn  mo- 
ments. At  Matins,  for  ex- 
ample, they  are  rung  before 
the  Gospel  is  read,  while 
the  lights  are  being  kin- 
dled, and  the  choir  is  sing- 
ing :  Praise  ye  the  Lord. 
At  the  Divine  Liturgy  one 
bell  is  rung  while  the  Holy 
Gifts  are  being  conse- 
crated. 

The  Interior.  The 
Temple  is  usually  built  in 
the  form  of  a  ship  (the 
ship  of  salvation),  or  of  a 
cross  (the  emblem  of  sal- 
vation). The  Temple  is 
divided  into  four  parts : 
i.  The  Sanctuary  (Altar), 
beyond  the  Image-screen 
(Ikonostds).     2.    The    pro- 

*  These  explanations  are  derived  chiefly  from  the  valuable  work  of  Archpriest  Konstantin 
Nikolsky  :  An  Aid  to  the  Study  of  the  Orthodox  Church.    St.  Petersburg,  1894. 


THE  SYMBOLISM  OF  THE  CHURCH

longation  of  the  Sanctuary  platform  outside  the  Image-screen,  called 
the  Soled,  which  consists  of  :  (a)  the  Amvon,  or  Tribune,  which  is  the 
portion  immediately  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door,  in  the  centre  of  the 
Screen,  and  (b)  the  railed  Kliros,  or  places  for  the  two  choirs,  on  either 
side  of  the  Amvon.  3.  The  Body  of  the  church.  4.  The  Porch 
(Pritvor). 

The  Sanctuary  must  be  built,  except  when  that  is  impossible,  at  the 
eastern  end  of  the  church. 

The  Altar  (Prestol)  represents  the  throne  of  God  in  heaven,  and  the 


Corporal 

Lord  God  Almighty  himself  is  present  thereon.  It  also  represents 
the  tomb  of  Christ,  since  his  Body  is  placed  thereon. 

The  first  covering  of  the  Altar,  the  white  linen  Sratchitsa,  represents 
the  winding-sheet  in  which  the  body  of  our  Lord  was  wrapped.  The 
upper  Altar-cloth  {Inditid),  of  rich  and  brilliant  material,  represents  the 
glory  of  God's  throne.    Both  cloths  cover  the  Altar  to  the  ground. 

On  the  Altar  is  placed  the  Corporal  {Antimins),  a  silken  (formerly 
a  linen)  cloth,  having  upon  it  the  representation  of  the  Deposition  of 
Christ  in  the  tomb  and  the  four  Evangelists.  This  is  spread  out  only 
in  the  Divine  Liturgy,  at  the  beginning  of  the  Liturgy  of  the  Faith- 
ful, and  is  folded  up  again  as  soon  as  that  is  finished.    If  any  accident 


XXX 


THE    SYMBOLISM    OF    THE    CHURCH 


Dikiri 


Trikiri 


should  happen  to  the  holy  Altar,  the  Holy  Oblation  can  be  made  upon 
the  Corporal  alone,  in  an  unconsecrated  building  or  suitable  place.  In 
this  Corporal  (Antimins),  or  Vice-Altar,  are  placed  relics  of  the  Saints. 
Other  relics  are  placed  under  and  in  the  Altar  itself,  in  a  specially  pre- 
pared coffer ;  because  the  blood  of  the  Martyrs,  after  that  of  Christ 

himself,  serves  as  the  foundation  of  the 
Church.  And  also  because,  in  the  early 
days  of  Christianity,  the  Holy  Eucharist 
was  celebrated  in  the  Catacombs,  on  the 
tombs  of  the  Martyrs. 

Under  the  Corporal,  and  upon  the  upper 
Altar-cloth  is  placed  a  square  of  fine  linen 
or  rich  material  called  the  Iliton,  which 
symbolizes  the  swaddling-clothes  wherein 
the  Lord  was  wrapped  after  his  birth  ;  and 
also  the  winding-sheet  wherein  his  body  was 
enveloped  in  the  tomb,  as  the  Altar  repre- 
sents the  gravestone. 

Behind  the  Altar  a  seven-branched  can- 
delabra is  usually  placed  (seven  being  the 
customary  sacred  number)  ;  and,  sometimes 
a  large  Cross,  for  carrying  in  processions. 
The  Book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  being  the  Word  of  God,  is  laid  upon 
the  Altar,  to  denote  that  God  himself  is  mystically  present  thereon  ; 
and  the  Cross  stands  on  the  Altar  as  upon  the  place  where  is  celebrated 
the  unbloody  sacrifice  offered  up  to  God. 

As  the  Altar  represents  the  sepulchre  of  the  Lord,  an  Ark  (Kovtcheg) 
is  set  thereon,  being  the  Tabernacle  in  which  are  placed  the  Holy 
Gifts,  the  Body  and  Blood  of 
Christ  reserved  for  the  sick, 
and  (during  the  Great  Fast  — 
Lent)  for  the  Liturgy  of  the 
Presanctified  Gifts. 

Upon  the  Altar  is  kept  the 
Holy  Chrism  for  Chrismation 
after  Baptism.  Tapers  are 
placed  upon  the  Altar  to  typify 
the  light  of  Christ,  which  illu- 
mines the  world  ;  and,  at 
Pontifical  Services,  the  double 
and  triple  branched  candle- 
sticks (Dikiri,  Trikiri)  —  re- 
presenting, respectively,  the 
dual  nature  of  Christ  (human 
and  divine)  and  the  Holy 
Trinity  —  wherewith     the

Bishop  bestows  his  blessing  on  the  people.  It  is  strictly  for- 
bidden to  place  anything  whatsoever  on  the  Altar  save  the 
objects  which  are  here  enumerated.  A  sponge  is  usually 
placed  beside  the  Corporal,  for  the  more  careful  brushing 
off  of  the  particles  from  the  Paten  into  the  Chalice.  In  some 
places  a  Canopy  (Sye'n)  is  suspended  over  the  Altar,  to  re- 
present the  heavens  outspread  above  the  earth,  upon  which 
was  offered  up  the  sacrifice  for  the  sins  of  the  world. 

Behind  the  Altar  is  the  High  Place  (Gomoye  Mytsto),  an 
elevation  upon  which  stands  the  Bishop's  throne.  At  cer- 
tain times  during  the  service  the  Bishop  sits  thereon,  re- 
presenting the  King  of  Glory.  On  either  side  of  the  "  High 
Place "  are  seats  for  those  who  celebrate  with  the  Bishop, 
and  represent  the  Apostles  and  their  successors.  At  either 
side  of  the  "  High  Place,"  during  Pontifical  services,  are 
placed  the  Sacramental  Fans  {Ripidi),  representing  the 
six-winged  Seraphim,  with  which  the  Holy  Gifts  are  fanned 
to  keep  away  insects. 

The  Credence  (Table  of  Oblation  —  Zhertvennik)  is  in 
the  northern  part  of  the  Sanctuary,  and  on  it  the  Holy  Gifts  are  pre- 
pared for  consecration.

For  their  preparation  and  for 
communicating  them  the  following 
sacred  vessels  and  implements  are 
used  : 

The  Paten  (Diskos),  for  the

above  the  Paten  so  that  it  may 
not  touch  the  Holy  Body ;  the 
Chalice  (Potir),  for  the  wine  ;  the 
Spear  (Kopyo),  with  which  the 
particles  are  taken  from  the  Altar- 
breads  (Pros/огг),  and  represents 
the  spear  with  which  the  Saviour's 
side  was  pierced  ;  the  sacramental  Spoon  (Lzhitza),  with  which  the 
Holy  Body  and  Blood  are  administered  to  the  laity  ;  the  Sponge  {Gubka}

with  which  the  Chalice  is  wiped  out  at  the  end  of  the  Communion  ; 
three  Veils  (Pokrovy)  ;  two  smaller,  for  covering  the  Paten  and  Chalice, 
and  one  which  is  called  the  Air  ( Vozdukh),  for  covering  both  Paten 
and  Chalice  ;  the  Ladle  (Kovsh),  in  which  the  holy  tepid  water  and  wine 
are  offered  (together  with  portions  of  the  bread),  to 
the  communicants,  after  they  have  received  the 
Holy  Gifts  ;  two  salvers  for  the  Altar-breads. 

The  Censer  (Kadilo),  which,  with  the  incense 
placed  therein,  is  symbolical  of  the  gifts  offered  by 
the  Wise  Men  to  the  infant  Christ,  —  gold,  frank- 
incense, and  myrrh,  —  is  also  necessary  for  most 
services. 

The  southern  side  of  the  Sanctuary  is  usually 
appointed  as  the  Repository  (Didkonnik)  for  the 
vestments,  church  books,  and  the  vessels  used  in 
the  divine  service. 

The  Sanctuary  is  separated  from  the  choir-place 
and  the   body  of  the  Temple  by  a  solid  Image-screen 
{Ikonostds),  which  corresponds  to  the  chancel-rail  in  the 
Western  Church.    Three  doors  give  access  through  it  to 
the  different  parts  of  the  Sanctuary  above  mentioned. 

The  central  opening  is  called  the  Royal  Gate  {Tzdrs- 
kiya  Vratd),  because  through  it,  at  the  Divine  Liturgy,  the 
King  of  Glory  comes  forth  to  feed  his  faithful  people 
with  his  own  Divine  Body  and  Blood  ;  or  the  Holy  Door 
{Svyatya  Vratd),  because  the  Mystery  of  the  Eucharist 
is  celebrated  in  the  Sanctuary,  and  through  this  door  (or 
gate)  the  Holy  Gifts  are  brought  forth.  Unordained 
men  are  not  permitted  to  pass  through  it.  No  woman 
may  enter  the  Sanctuary  at  any  time. 

The  opening  and  closing  of  the  Holy  Door,  at  different 
points  of  the  various  services,  signify  several  things  : 
sometimes  the  opening  of  the  gates  of  Paradise  ;  some- 
times the  throwing  open  of  the  entrance  into  the  King- 
dom of  Heaven.  The  Entrances  and  Exits  through  it  of 
the  clergy  symbolize  the  progress  to  and  from  those 
places  where  the  Saviour  of  the  world  abode  ;  since  the 
priest,  at  different  points,  represents  the  Saviour  himself 
or  the  Angel  of  God  proclaiming  the  Resurrection  of 
Christ ;  while  the  Deacon  represents  the  Angel  of  the 
Lord,  or  John  the  Baptist. 

The  Curtain  inside  the  Holy  Door  is  drawn  or  with- 
drawn at  appointed  times  during  divine  service.  The 
Image-screen  {Ikonostds)  portrays  those  who  dwell  in  heaven.  In  the 
Image-screen  are  the  Holy  Pictures  (Images  —  Ikoni)  of  the  Lord 
God  magnified  in  the  Trinity ;   of  the  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  our 


Censer

Lord ;  of  the  Holy  Angels,  Prophets  and  Apostles,  and  other 
Saints    of    God ;    and    presentments    of   sacred   events   which 
have  happened  for  our  salvation.    The  customary  arrangement 
of  the  holy  Images  is  as  follows  :  On  the  right  of  the  Holy 
Door  is  placed  the  image  of  the  Saviour,  and  next  it  (or  next 
the  south  door,  if  that  be  next),  the  Image 
f9   of  the  Temple,  or  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the 
Temple.    On  the  left  of  the  Holy  Door  is  the 
Image  of  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God.    On 
the  leaves  of  the  Holy  Door  itself  (which 
represents  the  Entrance  into  Heaven)  is  the 
Image  of  the  Annunciation,  that  being  the 
forefront   of   our  salvation  ;    together  with 
the  Images  of  the  Four   Evangelists,   who 
also,  like  the  Archangel  Gabriel,  announced 
to  the  world  the  glad  tidings  of  the  Saviour. 
Over  the  Holy  Door  is  the  Image  (Ikoua) 
of  the  Last  Supper  ,  because  in  the  Sanc- 
tuary is  celebrated  the  Mystery  <>t  the-  l.u- 
charist,  reminding  us  that  those  who  wish 
to  follow  Christ  and  obtain  entrance  to  the 
kingdom    of    heaven    must    be   accounted 
worthy   to   partake  of   the   Lord's  Supper, 
which  is  prepared  within  the  Holy  Door,  and  offered  to  the 
laity  in  front  of  that  door. 

On  the  northern  and  southern  doors  are  depicted  the  mes- 
sengers of  God,  the  Angels,  sent  to  serve  those  who  desire  to 
follow  after  salvation  ;  or  holy  Deacons,  the  types  of  the  Angels, 
who  have  charge  of  those  parts  of  the  Sanctuary  into  which 
these  doors  lead. 
At  each  Kliros  (Choir-place)  stands  a  holy  Banner  (Khonigv  i , 
that  is,  a  holy  picture  mounted  upon  a  staff,  typifying  the  victorious 
Banner  of  Christ's  Church,  which  wages  incessant  warfare  with  the 
enemies  of  salvation. 

In  large  churches,  in  line  with  the  Images  of  the  Saviour  and  the  holy 
Birth-giver  of  God  in  the  Image-screen,  are  placed  Images  of  the  more 
especially  revered  Saints.  Above  them,  in  the  second  row,  are  the  Images 
of  the  Feasts  of  our  Lord,  and  of  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God.  In  the 
third  row  are  the  Images  of  those  Saints  who,  on  earth  as  in  heaven,  were 
deemed  worthy  to  be  nearest  to  the  Saviour,  namely  :  Over  the  Image 
of  the  Last  Supper  is  placed  the  Image  of  Jesus  Christ  himself,  in  royal 
or  episcopal  robes,  having  on  his  right  hand  the  holy  Birth-giver  of 
God,  and  on  his  left  St.  John  the  Baptist.  This  Image  is  called  the  Deists 
(Prayer),  the  Holy  pother  and  St.  John  being  turned  toward  the  Saviour 
in  supplication  ;  and  on  either  side  it  has  the  Images  of  the  Apostles. 
In  the  next  row  are  placed  the  Images  of  the  Old  Testament  Saints, 


xxxiv  THE    SYMBOLISM    OF    THE    CHURCH 

—  the  Prophets  :  and  among  them  is  placed  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God 
with  the  Divine  Child,  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  who  was  their  hope, 
their  consolation,  and  the  subject  of  their  prophecies. 

Images  and  the  fittings  of  the  Temple  are  used  in  accordance  with 
the  command  of  God  :  Exodus  xxv.  18-20;  xxvi.  1,  31.* 

The  Body  of  the  Church.  The  space  extending  from  the  Sanc- 
tuary platform  [Soled)  to  the  Porch  (Pritvor)  is  appointed  for  the  lay 
worshippers,  who  generally  stand  throughout  the  service,  —  usually  in 
two  groups,  — the  men  on  the  right  and  the  women  on  the  left.  In  this 
part  of  the  church,  during  Pontifical  services,  in  the  centre  there  is  placed 
a  raised  dais,  called  the  Kdthedra.  Here  the  Bishop  is  vested,  and  here, 
also,  he  performs  a  portion  of  the  service ;  and  sometimes,  even,  the 
entire  service,  praying  like  a  father  surrounded  by  his  children. 


In  spacious  churches,  there  is  also  placed,  close  to  the  Sanctuary 
platform,  the  Tomb  for  the  Winding-sheet  [Plashtschanitza) ;  and  a 
small  table  for  Requiem  services,  with  the  Requiem-stand  {Panikliid- 
nik),\  with  places  for  tapers  and  a  vessel  for  grain. 

The  Vestibule  {Pritvor),  or  inner  porch,  was  appointed,  in  early  times, 
for  the  Catechumens,  or  learners,  and  for  penitents.  Here  they  listened 
to  exhortations  and  instruction,  and  here  they  prayed.  The  rubric 
decrees  that  the  Office  for  the  Reception  of  Converts  shall  be  performed 
in  this  Vestibule.  Several  of  the  penitential  Offices,  also,  are  appointed 
to  be  said  here,  such  as  the  Litiyd  (a  litany  of  fervent  supplication,  with 
oft-repeated  "Lord,  have  mercy"  in  response)  at  Vespers. 

Lights.  Lights  are  always  used  during  divine  service,  even  though 
it  be  performed  in  full  sunlight.  This  is  done  not  only  for  illumination, 
but  also  to  show  that  the  Lord,  who  dwells  in  light  ineffable,  illumines 
the  world  with  spiritual  radiance  ;  to  denote  that  the  hearts  of  faithful 
believers  are  warmed  by  a  flame  of  love  toward  God  and  his  Saints ; 
and,  also,  to  show  forth  spiritual  joy  and  the  triumph  of  the  Church. 

Wax  and  olive  oil,  as  the  purest  of  substances,  and  free  from  animal

matter,  are  used  for  lighting  before  sacred  things.  Artificial  light  also 
is  permitted,  but  only  for  illumination.  The  wax  and  oil  are  symbolical 
of  the  purity  and  sincerity  of  the  gifts  which  provide  them,  made  in  the 
holy  Name  of  God. 

The  lights  in  the  Temple  are  kindled  in  accordance  with  the  songs 
and  services.  The  more  vivid  the  joy  of  the  Church  in  the  Lord,  the 
more  solemn  the  service,  the  more  numerous  are- the  lights.  On  Great 
Feasts  all  the  lights  are  not  kindled  at  the  beginning  of  the  service, 
but  at  the  approach  of  the  most  solemn  hymns  and  readings.  The 
rubrics  on  these  points  are  detailed  and  precise.  More  lights  are  used 
at  the  Divine  Liturgy  than  at  the  other  services,  as  a  rule. 

Attitude.  Only  two  attitudes  are  recognized  as  befitting  the 
house  of  God  :  standing  and  kneeling.  There  are  some  moments  of  the 
service  when  sitting  is  proper.  But  usually  it  is  tolerated  only  as  a  con- 
cession to  physical  weakness.  On  Sundays  and  Feast  Days,  with  few 
exceptions,  the  rubric  of  the  Church  does  not  permit  kneeling ;  that 
is,  reverences  to  the  earth.  From  holy  Easter  Day  until  Pentecost 
(Trinity  Sunday)  no  kneeling  is  appointed.  The  joy  of  .the  worship- 
pers at  that  season  is  held  to  outweigh  even  their  sense  of  lowly 
penitence  for  sin,  which  prompts  to  kneeling. 

The  Sign  of  the  Cross  is  made  with  the  thumb  and  the  first  two 
fingers  of  the  right  hand  joined  at  the  tips  (the  third  and  fourth  fingers 
being  closed  on  the  palm),  as  a  symbol  of  the  Trinity,  by  touching  the 
brow,  the  breast,  the  right  shoulder  and  the  left  shoul- 
der :  in  token  that  every  power  of  mind,  heart,  soul 
and  strength  are  dedicated  to  the  service  of  God.  It 
is  made,  accompanied  by  a  simple  inclination  of  the 
head  and  body,  always  at  the  occur- 
rence in  prayers  and  litanies  of  the 
words :  "  Let  us  attend,"  "  Lord,  have 
mercy,"  "  Grant  it,  O  Lord,"  "  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,"  "  Let 
us  pray  to  the  Lord,"  and  so  forth. 

The  sign  of  the  Cross,  accompa- 
nied by  a  reverence  to  the  very 
earth,  is  made  when  the  following 
words  occur  :  "  Let  us  worship  and 
fall  down;"  "Let  us  give  thanks 
unto  the  Lord  ;  "  or  when  the  singers 
sing,  "Meet  and  right  is  it  to  adore 
thee,"  "We  praise  thee,  we  bless  thee;"  "Our  Father, 
who  art  in  heaven  ; "  and  when  the  holy  Chalice  is 
brought  forth,  during  the  Divine  Liturgy,  with  the 
words  :  "  Always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages  ; "  "  In  the  fear 
of  God  and  with  faith  draw  near." 

A  reverence,  unaccompanied  by  the  sign  of  the  Cross,  is  made  when

the  Priest  pronounces  the  words,  "  Peace  be  with  you  all,"  "  The  grace 
of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  be  with  you  all,"  "  The  blessing  of  the  Lord  be 
upon  you  ; "  or  when  he  exclaims,  "  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord." 

Bishops  and  Priests,  in  bestowing  the  Benediction,  hold  the  fingers 
in  such  a  manner  as  to  represent  the  Greek  letters  IC,  XC  —  the  first 
and  last  letters  of  Jesus  Christ. 

Incense.  The  Holy  Images  (Ikoui),  the  Holy  Things,  and  the  people 
who  are  present  at  the  divine  service,  are  honoured  with  incense.  The 
censing  before  the  Holy  Door  signifies  the  desire  of  the  worshippers 
that  their  prayers  shall  be  borne  up  to  the  throne  of  God,  as  the  in- 
cense from  the  censer  is  wafted  heavenward  ;  and  that  their  petitions 
shall  be  well-pleasing  to  God  like  fragrant  incense.  The  censing  of  the 
people  is  symbolical  of  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  which  is  shed 
abroad  everywhere,  upon  all  men.  The  censer  {Kadilo)  represents  the 
Divine  Ember,  even  Christ. 

For  the  special  significance  of  the  censing  at  different  points  of  the 
services,  see  the  Explanations  provided  in  Appendix  B. 


SACERDOTAL    VESTMENTS. 

Reader.    A  short  Tunic  {Felon),  which  barely  covers  the  shoulders, 
is  put  upon  the  Reader  when  he  is  set  apart  by  the  Bishop,  and  (at  the 

present  time)  is  rarely  worn  except 
upon  that  day.  It  symbolizes  his 
coming  under  the 
yoke  of  the  Priest- 
hood, and  his  dedica- 
tion to  the  service  of 
God.  His  usual  vest- 
ment is  a  Dalmatic 
{Stikhdr).

Dalmatic  (Stikkar) 

of  a  pure  and  tranquil  conscience,  a  spotless  life,  and  the  spiritual  joy 
in  the  Lord  which  flows  therefrom,  in  him  who  wears  it.  The  Stole  is  a 
long,  wide  band  of  material  which  is  sometimes  worn  over  the   left 


THE    SYMBOLISM    OF    THE    CHURCH 


XXXVll 


shoulder,  sometimes  crossed  upon  the  breast  and  back,  in  the  case  of  the 
Deacon.  The  Sub-Deacon  wears  his  Stole  always  crossed,  for  conven- 
ience in  the  fulfilment  of  his  duties.  But  the  Deacon  binds  his  Stole 
about  him  in  the  form  of  a  cross  shortly  before  the  Holy  Gifts  are  con- 
secrated, thus  typifying  the  wings  of  the  Angels  who  serve  about  the 
Altar,  as  the  Deacons  themselves  typify  the  Cherubim  and  Seraphim. 
Sometimes  the  Angelic  song,  "  Holy,  Holy,  Holy,"  is  embroidered 
upon  the  Stole.  The  Stole  is  bound  about  the  Sub-Deacon  in  the  form 
of  a  cross  at  his  Ordination,  as  a  symbol  that,  through  the  meekness 
and  continence  of  his  members  and  the  purity  of  his  heart,  he  is  to 
put  upon  him  the  robe  of  purity.     The  Deacon  wears,  also,  the  Cuffs 


Cuffs 


Zone,  or  Girdle 


Cassock 


Stole  (Efitrakhil) 


{Porutchi),  for  convenience  during  the  service,  and  to  remind  him  that 
he  must  not  put  his  trust  in  his  own  strength  alone,  but  in  the  right  hand 
of  the  Lord,  the  Almighty  and  merciful  God,  and  in  His  strength  and  aid. 

Priests.  The  Priest's  stikhdr,  or  cassock  (Podriznik),  has  close 
sleeves.  His  Stole  (Epitrakhil)  consists  of  a  long  piece  of  stuff  like 
the  Deacon's,  but  broader  than  the  latter,  which  passes  round  his  neck, 
is  joined  in  front  for  its  entire  length,  and  falls  low  upon  his  cassock. 
It  typifies  the  consecrating  grace  of  the  Priesthood.  The  Priest,  like  the 
Deacon,  can  celebrate  no  Office  without  his  Stole.  In  it,  without  the 
Chasuble,  he  celebrates  the  less  solemn  Offices  :  Lesser  Vespers,  ordi- 
nary Compline,  Lauds  {Polunotchnitza),  the  Hours  (if  the  Gospel  be  not 
appointed  to  be  read  in  them)  ;  also  various  Prayer-services  in  private 
dwellings,  such  as  that  at  the  birth  of  a  child,  and  the  like. 

The  Zone  {Pay as)  is  sort  of  belt  wherewith  the  Priest  girds  himself 


xxxvui  THE    SYMBOLISM    OF    THE    CHURCH 

above  his  cassock  and  stole,  for  convenience  in  serving  the  Altar.  It  is 
symbolical  of  the  gift  of  strength,  wherewith  God  aids  him  in  his  ser- 
vice, and  exhorts  him  to  blamelessness  of  life.  His  Cuffs  (Porutchi) 
typify  the  bonds  wherewith  the  hands  of  our  Lord  were  bound. 

The  Epigonation  (Nabe'drennik)  is  an  oblong  piece  of  brocade,  which 
is  suspended  upon  the  hip  of  a  priest,  and  signifies  the  Sword  of  the 
Spirit,  which  is  the  Word  of  God.  It  is  also  explained  as  being  sym- 
bolical of  the  towel  wherewith  the  Saviour  girded  himself  to  wash  the 
disciples'  feet. 

The  Palitza  is  identical  with  the  Epigonation,  except  that  it  is  sus- 


Epigondtion 


Palitza 


Biretta 
(Skzifya) 


Biretta 

(Kamilavkd) 


Chasuble 


pended  by  one  corner  instead  of  by  two  corners.  It  is  always  worn  on  the 
right  hip.  The  Epigonation  is  worn  on  the  right  hip  ;  but  if  the  Priest 
have  also  a  Palitza,  the  Epigonation  is  worn  on  the  left  hip.  Both  the 
Epigonation  and  the  Palitza  are  typical  of  profound  zeal  for  the  faith, 
and  for  the  salvation  of  Christ's  flock,  and  are  conferred  as  rewards  of 
honour. 

The  distinguishing  vestment  of  the  Priest  is  the  Chasuble  (Felon),  a 
long,  ample  garment  without  sleeves,  short  in  front  and  with  an  open- 
ing for  the  head,  which  is  put  on  over  the  other  vestments. 

Archpriests  and  Priests  also  receive,  as  tokens  of  distinguished  ser- 
vice, the  pointed  and  the  upright  Biretta  —  the  skufyd  and  the  kami- 
lavka. 

A  Bishop  wears  all  the  vestments  of  a  Priest,  save  the  Chasuble  and 
Epigonation,  his  biretta  being  perpendicular,  black,  and  draped  with 


THE  SYMBOLISM  OF  THE  CHURCH

the  monastic  veil  or  cowl.  In  place  of 
the  Chasuble  a  Bishop  wears  a  Dalmatic, 
which  closely  resembles  the  wide- 
sleeved  Dalmatic  of  the  Deacon.  This 
Dalmatic  (Sdkkos)  is  symbolical  of 
Christ's  coat  without  a  seam,  woven 
from  top  to  bottom.  The  Bishop's 
Stole  [Omofor — Pall)  is  very  broad, 
and  hangs  down  in  front  and  behind 
over  his  other  vestments.  His  Pall  typ- 
ifies the  wandering  sheep,  and  the 
Prelate,  when  arrayed  in  this  vestment, 
bears  the  image  of  the  Saviour  Christ, 
who,  as  the  Good  Shepherd,  took  upon 
his  shoulders  the  wandering  sheep  and 
bare  it  to  those  who  wander  not;  that 
is,  to  the  Angels,  in  his  Father's  house. 
The  Mitre  is  typical  of  a  diadem  or 
crown,  and  serves  as  an  emblem  of  the 
power  bestowed  upon  a  minister  of  the 
Church.    (The  Mitre  is  conferred  also 


A,  Dalmatic  (Sdkkos).     B,  Pall 


upon  Archimandrites,  or  Abbots,  and  upon 
certain  Archpriests.)  The  Panagia,  which  is 
worn  on  his  breast  by  a  Bishop,  is  generally  a 
small,  circular  Holy  Image,  or  Ikona,  of  our  Sa- 
viour and  the  Birth-giver 
of  God.  The  Panagia  (or 
"all-holy")  reminds  the 
Bishop  that  he  must  al- 
ways bear  in  his  heart  our 
Lord  and  his  holy  Mother, 
the  Intercessor  with  God  ; 
and,  to  that  end  his  heart 
must  be  pure,  and  his  spirit 
upright. 
The  Bishop's  Mantle  (Mdntiya)  is  a  monastic 

vestment,  which  covers  the  whole  person  with  the 

exception  of  the  head.     Its    freely  flowing  lines 

typify  the  wings  of  the  Angels  ;  hence  it  is  called 

"the  Angelic  vestment."    The  folds  of  the  Mantle 

are  symbolical  of  the  all-embracing  power  of  God  ; 

and  also  of  the  strictness,  piety  and  meekness  of 

the  monastic  life  ;  and  that  the  hands  and  other 

i  r  it  ,i-  i  i.   r^      i      Pectoral  Image  (Panagia) 

members  of  a  monk  do  not  live,  and  are  not  fitted 

for  worldly  activity,  but  are  all  dead.    All  monks,  when  present  at  divine 

service,  must  be  robed  in  their  mantles.

THE    SYMBOLISM    OF    THE    CHURCH 


The  peculiarity  of  a  Bishop's  man- 
tle is  that  it  is  not  black  in  hue,  like 
the  monastic  mantle,  but  of  purple, 
or  some  other  colour  ;  and  upon  it 
are  sewn  the  so-called  "Tables  of  the 
Law  "  (Skrizhdli),  and,  in  particular, 
the  "  Fountains  "  (Istotchniki).  The 
Tables  (squares  of  velvet  at  neck  and 
foot)  typify  the  Old  and  the  New 
Testament,  whence  the  ministers  of 
God  should  draw  their  doctrine.  The 
" fountains"  are  ribbons,  usually  red 
and  white  in  hue,  sewn  horizontally 
round  the  Mantle,  and  represent  the 
streams  of  teaching  which  flow  from 
the  mouth  of  the  Bishop.  Small 
bells  are  attached  to  the  Mantle  of 
a  Bishop,  and  to  his  Dalma- 
tic, as  to  the  upper  robe  of 
the  High  Priest  of  the  Jews. 
The  Crozier,  or  Pastoral 
Staff  (Posokh),  is  given  to 
Bishops  and  to  Archiman- 
drites, in  token  of  their  spir- 
itual authority  over  the  monasteries  or  cities  which  they  rule ; 
and  as  a  sign  that  it  behooves  them  to  feed  the  flock  of  Christ. 
The  Eagle  {Orletz)  is  a  small  circular  rug,  with  the  representa- 
tion of  a  one-headed  eagle  soaring  over  a  battlemented  city.    A 

Bishop  stands  on  this  rug 
during  divine  service,  and  to 
him  alone  is  its  use  accorded. 
He  is  led  upon  alarge  "Eagle" 
at  his  Consecration,  as  the 
Office  of  Consecration  sets 
forth.  (See  that  Office.)  The 
view  of  the  city  betokens  the 
Prelate's  rule  over  the  city ; 
the  Eagle  denotes  the  lofti- 
ness and  purity  of  his  teach- 
ing. Thus  the  Eagle-rug  spread 
for  a  Bishop  to  stand  upon 
signifies  that  he,  by  his  life  Crozier 
and  doctrine,  must  resemble 
the  eagle,  which  soars  above  all  lower 
things,  and  aspires  unto  heaven.

The  Holy  Doors  are  open.    The  Priest  standeth  before  the  Altar  with  the  censer,  and 
the  Deacon  with  the  taper. 


GREAT  VESPERS 

Deacon.  Arise,  Master,  give  the  blessing. 

Priest.  Glory  to  the  Holy,  Consubstantial,  Life-giving  and  Undivided 
Trinity  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  (2) 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us 
worship  and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 
O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down  before  him.     (Three  reverences.) 

From  Easter  until  Ascension  Day,  in  place  of,  O  come,  let  us  worship,  shall  be  sung: 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  Easter- 
and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

Then  shall  be  said  or  sung  Psalm  civ.  ;  and  the  Priest,  preceded  by  the  Deacon  bearing 
a  taper,  shall  cense  the  whole  temple,  after  which  the  Holy  Door  is  closed.  (3) 


Psalm  civ. 
Praise  the  Lord,  O  my 
soul.  Blessed  art  thou,  O 
Lord.  O  Lord  my  God, 
thou  art  become  exceed- 
ing glorious.  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  Lord.  O  Lord, 
how  manifold  are  thy 
works:  In  wisdom  hast 
thou  made  them  all. 
Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord, 
who  hast  made  them  all. 

Thus  much  is  generally  used. 
But  sometimes  the  whole  is 
read  or  sung,  as  follow- 
eth : 

Praise  the  Lord,  O  my 
soul:   O   Lord    my    God, 


The  Priest  now  taketh  his  stand  before  the  Holy 
Door,  with  head  uncovered,  and  reciteth  the 
Prayers  of  Light,  secretly.  (4) 


O  Lord,  bountiful  and  compassionate, 
long-suffering  and  plenteous  in  mercy, 
give  ear  unto  our  prayer,  and  attend  to 
the  voice  of  our  supplication.  Work 
upon  us  a  sign  for  good.  Lead  us  in  thy 
way,  that  we  may  walk  in  thy  truth. 
Make  glad  our  hearts,  that  we  may  fear 
thy  holy  Name.  For  thou  art  great  and 
doest  wonders.  Thou  alone  art  God, 
and  among  all  the  gods  there  is  none 
like  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  mighty  in  mercy, 
gracious  in  strength,  to  aid  and  to  com- 
fort and  save  all  those  who  put  their 
trust  in  thy  holy  Name.

thou  art  become  exceed-

foundations  of  the  earth,

edst  it  with  the  deep  like 
as  a  garment;  the  waters 
stand  in  the  hills.  At  thy 
rebuke  they  flee;  at  the

high  as  the  hills,  and  down

even  unto  the  place  which 
thou  hast  appointed  for 
them.  Thou  hast  set  them 
their  bounds,  which  they 
shall  not  pass,  neither 
turn  again  to  cover  the 
earth.  He  sendeth  the 
springs  into  the  rivers, 
which  run  among  the 
hills.  All  the  beasts  of 
the  field  drink  thereof, 
and  the  wild  asses  quench 
their  thirst.  Beside  them 
shall  the  fowls  of  the  air 
have  their  habitation,  and 
sing  among  the  branches. 
He  watereth  the  hills  from 


For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour

O  Lord,  rebuke  us  not  in  thy  displeas-

Birth-giver  of  God,  and  of  all  the  Saints. 

For  thine  is  the  majesty,  and  thine

glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 


O  Lord  our  God,  remember  us  sinners 
and  thine  unprofitable  servants  when  we 
call  upon  thy  holy  Name,  and  put  us  not 
to  shame  in  our  expectation  of  thy  mercy : 
but  grant  us,  O  Lord,  all  our  petitions 
which  are  unto  salvation,  and  vouchsafe 
that  we  may  love  and  fear  thee  with  all 
our  hearts,  and  do  thy  will  in  all  things. 

For  thou  art  a  gracious  God,  and 
lovest  mankind:  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the 
Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


O  thou  who,  with  never-silent  hymns 
and  never-ceasing  songs  of  praise  to  thy 
glory,  art  hymned  by  the  holy  Powers: 
Fill  our  mouths  with  thy  praise,  that  we 
may    magnify    thy    holy    Name.      And 


above;  the  earth  is  filled 
with  the  fruit  of  thy 
works.  He  bringeth  forth 
grass  for  the  cattle,  and 
green  herb  for  the  service 
of  men;  That  he  may 
bring  food  out  of  the 
earth,  and  wine  that  mak- 
eth  glad  the  heart  of  man  : 
and  oil  to  make  him  a 
cheerful  countenance,  and 
bread  to  strengthen  man's 
heart.  The  trees  of  the 
Lord  also  are  full  of  sap, 
even  the  cedars  of  Liba- 
nus  which  he  hath  plant- 
ed; wherein  the  birds 
make  their  nests;  and 
the  fir-trees  are  a  dwell- 
ing for  the  stork.  The 
high  hills  are  a  refuge 
for  the  wild  goats;  and  so 
are  the  stony  rocks  for 
the  conies.  He  appointed 
the  moon  for  certain  sea- 
sons, and  the  sun  know- 
eth  his  going  down.  Thou 
makest  darkness  that  it 
may  be  night;  wherein  all 
the  beasts  of  the  forests 
do  move.  The  lions, 
roaring  after  their  prey, 
do  seek  their  meat  from 
God.  The  sun  ariseth 
and  they  get  them  away 
together,  and  lay  them 
down  in  their  dens.  Man 
goeth  forth  to  his  work, 
and  to  his  labour,  until 
the  evening.  O  Lord, 
how  manifold  are  thy 
works!  in  wisdom  hast 
thou  made  them  all;  the 
earth  is  full  of  thy  riches.

THE  ALL-NIGHT  VIGIL  SERVICE 


So  is  the  great  and  wide  sea 
also;  wherein  are  creeping 
things  innumerable,  both 
small  and  great  beasts. 
There  go  the  ships,  and 
there  is  that  Leviathan, 
whom  thou  hast  made  to 
take  his  pastime  therein. 
These  all  wait  upon  thee, 
that  thou  mayest  give 
them  meat  in  due  season. 
When  thou  givest  it  them, 
they  gather  it;  and  when 
thou  openest  thy  hand, 
they  are  filled  with  good. 
When  thou  hidest  thy 
face,  they  are  troubled; 
when  thou  takest  away 
their  breath,  they  die,  and 
are  turned  again  to  their 
dust.  When  thou  lettest 
thy  breath  go  forth,  they 
shall  be  made:  the  Lord 
shall  rejoice  in  his  works. 
The  earth  shall  tremble  at 
the  look  of  him;  if  he  do 
but  touch  the  hills,  they 
shall  smoke.  I  will  sing 
unto  the  Lord  as  long  as  I 
live ;  I  will  praise  my  God 
while  I  have  my  being. 
And  so  shall  my  words 
please  him:  my  joy  shall 
be  in  the  Lord.  As  for 
sinners,  they  shall  be  con- 
sumed out  of  the  earth, 
and  the  ungodly  shall 
come  to  an  end.  Praise 
thou  the  Lord,  O  my  soul.

hast  immortality,  and  dwellest  in  light

unto  thee  our  evening  sacrifice  of  praise:

in  darkness;  and  grant  that  the  sleep, 
which  thou  hast  appointed  for  the  repose

imagination  of  the  Devil.  Yea,  O  Mas-

being  moved  to  compunction  upon  our 
beds,  call  to  remembrance  thy  holy 
Name  in  the  night  season:  that,  enlight-

rify thy  goodness,  offering  up  prayers

Then  shall  be  sung  the  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmatik)  (8)  in  the

Tone  I*    (Example.) 

Let  us  sing  the  praises  of  Mary,  Vir- 
gin, Door  of  heaven,  Glory  of  all  the 
world,  sprung  forth  from  man,  who  also 
bare  the  Lord;  the  Song  of  the  Bodi- 
less Powers,  and  the  Enriching  of  the 
faithful.  For  she  revealed  herself  as 
Heaven  and  the  Temple  of  the  God- 
head. She  destroyed  the  bulwarks  of 
enmity,  and  ushered  in  peace,  and 
threw  open  the  kingdom.  Wherefore, 
in  that  we  possess  this  confirmation  of 
our  faith  we  have  a  defender,  even  the 
Lord  who  was  born  of  her.  Be  bold, 
therefore,  be  bold,  ye  people  of  God, 
for  he,  the  All-Powerful,  will  vanquish 
your  foes. 

And  when  the  Dogmatik  is  finished  the  Deacon  shall  lift  up  the  censer,  as  he  standeth 
in  the  middle  of  the  Holy  Door,  and  shall  say  aloud: 

Wisdom,  O  believers! 

*  For  the  Dogmatiki,  see  Appendix  A. 


While  the  Dogmatik  is  being  sung,

High  Place,  through  the  Left 
Door,  and  stand  before  the  Holy

Holy  Pictures  (ikoni),  shall  say 
in  a  low  voice  to  the  Priest: 

Bless,  Master,  the  Holy  En-

And  the  Priest,  blessing  with  the 
sign  of  the  cross,  shall  say:

thy  Holy  Ones,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.

THE  LITIYA.  (12) 

But  sometimes  (especially  on  the  Eve  of  a  Great  Feast)  there  followeth  the  Litiyd,  that 
is,  the  Petitions  of  Fervent  Devotion. 

When  there  is  a  Litiyd,  the  Priest  and  Deacon,  preceded  by  taper  bearers,  come  to- 
gether to  the  end  of  the  Temple  opposite  the  Sanctuary,  while  the  Choir  is  singing 
the  Canticles  (Stikhiry  Litiyiuy)  of  the  Temple  or  of  the  Feast. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith,  aloud,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  heritage.  Visit  thy  world 
with  mercy  and  bounties;  exalt  the  horn  of  Orthodox  Christians, 
and  send  down  upon  us  thy  rich  mercies.  Through  the  prayers  of 
our  all-undefiled  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin 
Mary:  through  the  might  of  the  precious  and  life-giving  Cross: 
through  the  protection  of  the  honourable  Bodiless  Powers  of 
heaven;  of  the  honourable,  glorious  Prophet,  Forerunner  and  Bap- 
tist, John;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles;  of  our 
Holy  Fathers,  great  Hierarchs  and  (Ecumenical  Teachers,  Basil  the 
Great,  Gregory  the  Theologian  and  John  Chrysostom;  of  our  Holy 
Father  Nicholas,  Archbishop  of  Myra  in  Lycia,  the  Wonder-worker ; 
of  our  Holy  Fathers  Methodius  and  Kyril,  Evangelizers  of  the 
Slavs;  (of  our  Holy  Fathers  of  All-Russia,  Wonder-workers,  Peter, 
Alexis,  Jonah,  Philip) ;  of  the  holy,  glorious,  right-victorious  Mar- 
tyrs; of  our  reverend  and  God-bearing  Fathers,  the  holy  and  right-

Saint  of  the  Temple) ;  and  of  all  thy  Saints:  We  beseech  thee,  O  all-

Furthermore  we  pray  that  the  Lord  God  will  hearken  unto  the  voice  of 
petition  of  us  sinners,  and  show  mercy  upon  us. 

Choir    Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Then  the  Priest  maketh  mention,  secretly,  of  whomsoever  he  will,  both  of  the  living 
and  of  the  dead. 

Priest,  aloud.  Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of 
the  earth,  and  of  those  who  are  far  off  upon  the  sea;  and  show  mercy, 
show  mercy,  O  Master,  upon  us  sinners,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God  and  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir,  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Let  us  bow  our  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Then,  as  all  bow  their  heads,  the  Priest  rccitcth  the  following  Prayer,  so  that  all  may 
hear: 

O  most  merciful  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  through  the 
prayers  of  our  all-undefiled  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever- virgin 
Mary  (and  thence  as  in  the  preceding  prayer,  page  n,  ending  with) :  and  of 
all  thy  Saints:  Make  our  prayer  acceptable;  grant  us  remission  of  our 
transgressions;  hide  us  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings;  drive  far  from  us 
every  foe  and  adversary;  make  our  life  peaceful,  O  Lord.  Have  mercy 
upon  us  and  upon  thy  world;  and  save  our  souls:  forasmuch  as  thou  art 
gracious  and  lovest  mankind. 

Here  are  sung  the  appointed  Canticles  (Stikhiry)  in  the  proper  Tone,  or  of  the 
Uttyd.  Feast;  and  so  singing  we  return  to  the  centre  of  the  Temple,  where  in  special 

vessels  the  bread,  wine,  oil  and  wheat  are  already  prepared.

our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  shall  be  sung  the  Hymn  {Tropdr)  of  the  Feast* 

Hail,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God !  Mary  full  of  grace,  the  Lord  is  with 
thee.  Blessed  art  thou  among  women,  and  blessed  is  the  fruit  of  thy 
womb.     For  thou  hast  borne  the  Saviour  of  our  souls. 

After  the  Deacon  hath  censed  about  the  table  whereon  stand  the  bread,  wheat,  Blessing 

wine  and  oil,  (12)  the  Priest,  taking  one  of  the  loaves,  shall  make  there-  of  Bread,

And  immediately  after  the  Amen: 

Great  Choir.  Blessed  be  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  henceforth  and  for-

Psalm  xxxiv. 

Reader.  I  will  alway  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord;  his  praise  shall  ever 
be  in  my  mouth.  My  soul  shall  make  her  boast  in  the  Lord;  the  humble 
shall  hear  thereof,  and  be  glad.  O  praise  the  Lord  with  me,  and  let  us 
magnify  his  Name  together.  I  sought  the  Lord,  and  he  heard  me;  yea, 
he  delivered  me  out  of  all  my  fear.  They  had  an  eye  unto  him,  and  were 
lightened,  and  their  faces  were  not  ashamed.  Lo,  the  poor  crieth,  and  the 
Lord  heareth  him;  yea,  and  saveth  him  out  of  all  his  troubles.  The  angel 
of  the  Lord  tarrieth  round  about  them  that  fear  him,  and  delivereth 
them.  O  taste,  and  see,  how  gracious  the  Lord  is:  blessed  is  the  man  that 
trusteth  in  him.  O  fear  the  Lord,  ye  that  are  his  saints;  for  they  that  fear 
him  lack  nothing.  The  lions  do  lack,  and  suffer  hunger;  but  they  who 
seek  the  Lord  shall  want  no  manner  of  thing  that  is  good. 

And  the  Priest  cometh  forth,  and  standeth  before  the  Holy  Door.     And  when  the 
Psalm  is  finished,  he  turneth  and  saith  to  the  People: 

The  blessing  of  the  Lord,  through  his  grace  and  loving-kindness,  be 
upon  you  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.     Amen.

But  if  it  be  Great  Vespers  alone: 

Deacon.  Wisdom.

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  our  sure  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  Amen.  Lord,  have  mercy.  Bless, 
Master. 


MATINS  15 

And  the  Priest,  turning  from  the  Holy  Door  towards  the  people,  pronounceth  the 
Benediction: 

May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most-holy 
Mother;  of  Saint  N  (the  saint  of  the  day);  of  Saint  N.  (the  Saint  of  the 
Church),  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch 
as  he  is  gracious  and  loveth  mankind. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  MATINS  * 

When  the  All-Night  Vigil  is  celebrated  consecutively,  as  is  the  general  custom,  on 
the  Eve  of  the  Lord's  Day  or  of  a  Feast,  all  that  here  followcth,  down  to  Glory  to 
God  in  the  highest  (see  page  18),  shall  be  omitted.  When,  however,  from  necessity 
or  for  convenience,  Matins  are  celebrated  separately,  the  Priest  shall  begin  (the 
Holy  Door  being  closed) : 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  by  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us,  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ;  But  deliver  us  from 
the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Reader.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Twelve  times.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  wor- 
ship and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 
O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down  before  him. 

While  the  following  Psalms  are  being  read,  the  Priest  censeth  the  Holy  Altar, 
(1)  and  coming  forth  through  the  North  Door,  he  censeth  the  Holy  Images  and 
the  People. 

Psalm  xx.

Jacob  defend  thee:  send  thee  help  from  the  sanctuary,  and  strengthen 
thee  out  of  Zion:  remember  all  thy  offerings,  and  accept  thy  burnt- 
sacrifice:  grant  thee  thy  heart's  desire,  and  fulfil  all  thy  mind.  We 
will  rejoice  in  thy  salvation,  and  triumph  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord  our 
God:  the  Lord  perform  all  thy  petitions.  Now  know  1  that  the  Lord 
helpeth  his  Anointed,  and  will  hear  him  from  his  holy  heaven,  even 
with  the  wholesome  strength  of  his  right  hand.  Some  put  their  trust 
in  chariots,  and  some  in  horses ;  but  we  will  remember  the  Name  of  the 
Lord  our  God.  They  are  brought  down  and  fallen;  but  we  are  risen 
and  stand  upright.  Save,  Lord ;  and  hear  us,  O  King  of  heaven,  when 
we  call  upon  thee. 

Psalm  xxi. 

The  King  shall  rejoice  in  thy  strength,  O  Lord;  exceeding  glad 
shall  he  be  of  thy  salvation.  Thou  hast  given  him  his  heart's  desire, 
and  hast  not  denied  him  the  request  of  his  lips.  For  thou  shalt  pre- 
vent him  with  the  blessings  of  goodness,  and  shalt  set  a  crown  of  pure 
gold  upon  his  head.  He  asked  life  of  thee ;  and  thou  gavest  him  a  long 
life,  even  for  ever  and  ever.  His  honour  is  great  in  thy  salvation ;  glory 
and  great  worship  shalt  thou  lay  upon  him.  For  thou  shalt  give  him 
everlasting  felicity,  and  make  him  glad  with  the  joy  of  thy  counte- 
nance. And  why?  because  the  King  putteth  his  trust  in  the  Lord ;  and 
in  the  mercy  of  the  Most  Highest  he  shall  not  miscarry.  All  thine 
enemies  shall  feel  thy  hand;  thy  right  hand  shall  find  out  them  that 
hate  thee.  Thou  shalt  make  them  like  a  fiery  oven  in  time  of  thy 
wrath:  the  Lord  shall  destroy  them  in  his  displeasure,  and  the  fire 
shall  consume  them:  Their  fruit  shalt  thou  root  out  of  the  earth,  and 
their  seed  from  among  the  children  of  men.  For  they  intended  mis- 
chief against  thee,  and  imagined  such  a  device  as  they  are  not  able  to 
perform.  Therefore  shalt  thou  put  them  to  flight,  and  the  strings  of 
thy  bow  shalt  thou  make  ready  against  the  face  of  them.  Be  thou 
exalted,  Lord,  in  thine  own  strength;  so  will  we  sing,  and  praise  thy 
power. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     {Thrice.) 

O  all-holy  Trinity  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our 
sins.  O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and 
heal  our  infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy      {Thrice.)    Glory  now,  and  ever 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy 
kingdom  come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give 
us  this  day  our  daily  bread.    And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  for-

give  those  who  trespass  against  us.   And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ; 
But  deliver  us  from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari) : 

O  Lord,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance,  granting  to 
our  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  victory  over  all  adversaries,  and  by  thy 
Cross  preserving  thine  Estate. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Do  thou  who,  of  thine  own  good  will,  upon  the  Cross  wast  lifted  up, 
bestow  thy  bounties  upon  the  new  State  which  is  called  by  thy  Name, 
0  Christ,  God;  make  glad  with  thy  might  our  God-fearing  Ruler,  N., 
granting  victory  over  his  adversaries  unto  him  who  hath  thine  aid, 
which  is  a  panoply  of  peace,  a  trophy  invincible. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 
O  Champion  dread,  who  cannot  be  put  to  confusion,  despise  not 
our  petitions.  O  Good  One,  all-lauded  Birth-giver  of  our  God,  stab- 
lish  thou  the  State  of  those  who  hold  the  Orthodox  faith:  save  our 
God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  whom  thou  hast  called  to  rule  over  us,  and 
bestow  upon  him  victory  from  heaven:  for  thou  didst  give  birth  unto 
God,  O  only-blessed  One. 

Then  shall  the  Priest  say: 
Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  be- 
seech thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy

18  THE  ALL-NIGHT  VIGIL  SERVICE 

VIGIL. 

When  the  All-Night  Vigil  is  celebrated  in  its  usual  form,  all  the  foregoing  shall  be 
omitted;  and  after  the  Blessing  (see  page  15)  the  Holy  Doors  shall  be  closed,  and  the 
Reader  shall  immediately  say: 
Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  toward 
men.     (Thrice.) 

O  Lord,  open  thou  my  lips,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  forth  thy  praise. 
(Twice.) 

Easter-  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death, 

tide-  and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life.     (Thrice.) 

The  Reader  then  readeth  the  Six  Psalms. 

Psalm  hi. 
Lord,  how  are  they  increased  that  trouble  me!  many  are  they  that  rise 
against  me.  Many  one  there  be  that  say  of  my  soul,  There  is  no  help  for 
him  in  his  God.  But  thou,  O  Lord,  art  my  defender;  thou  art  my  worship, 
and  the  lifter  up  of  my  head.  I  did  call  upon  the  Lord  with  my  voice,  and 
he  heard  me  out  of  his  holy  hill.  I  laid  me  down  and  slept,  and  rose  up 
again ;  for  the  Lord  sustained  me.  I  will  not  be  afraid  for  ten  thousands 
of  the  people,  that  have  set  themselves  against  me  round  about.  Up, 
Lord,  and  help  me,  O  my  God!  For  thou  smitest  all  mine  enemies  upon 
the  cheek-bone;  thou  hast  broken  the  teeth  of  the  ungodly.  Salvation 
belongeth  unto  the  Lord;  and  thy  blessing  is  upon  thy  people.  I  laid  me 
down  and  slept,  and  rose  up  again ;  for  the  Lord  sustained  me. 

Psalm  xxxviii. 
Put  me  not  to  rebuke,  O  Lord,  in  thine  anger;  neither  chasten  me  in  thy 
heavy  displeasure.  For  thine  arrows  stick  fast  in  me,  and  thy  hand  press- 
eth  me  sore.  There  is  no  health  in  my  flesh,  because  of  thy  displeasure; 
neither  is  there  any  rest  in  my  bones,  by  reason  of  my  sin.  For  my  wick- 
ednesses are  gone  over  my  head,  and  are  like  a  sore  burden,  too  heavy  for 
me  to  bear.  My  wounds  stink,  and  are  corrupt,  through  my  foolishness. 
I  am  brought  into  so  great  trouble  and  misery,  that  I  go  mourning  all  the 
day  long.  For  my  loins  are  filled  with  a  sore  disease,  and  there  is  no  whole 
part  in  my  body.  I  am  feeble  and  sore  smitten ;  I  have  roared  for  the  very 
disquietness  of  my  heart.  Lord,  thou  knowest  all  my  desire;  and  my 
groaning  is  not  hid  from  thee.  My  heart  panteth,  my  strength  hath 
failed  me,  and  the  sight  of  mine  eyes  is  gone  from  me.  My  lovers  and  my 
neighbours  did  stand  looking  upon  my  trouble,  and  my  kinsmen  stood 
afar  off.  They  also  that  sought  after  my  life  laid  snares  for  me;  and  they 
that  went  about  to  do  me  evil  talked  of  wickedness,  and  imagined  deceit 
all  the  day  long.  As  for  me,  I  was  like  a  deaf  man,  and  heard  not;  and 
as  one  that  is  dumb,  who  doth  not  open  his  mouth.  I  became  even  as  a 
man  that  heareth  not,  and  in  whose  mouth  are  no  reproofs.    For  in  thee, 


MATINS  19 

0  Lord,  have  I  put  my  trust;  thou  shalt  answer  for  me,  0  Lord  my  God. 

1  have  required  that  they,  even  mine  enemies,  should  not  triumph  over 
me;  for  when  my  foot  slipt,  they  rejoiced  greatly  against  me.  And  I  truly 
am  set  in  the  plague,  and  my  heaviness  is  ever  in  my  sight.  For  I  will  con- 
fess my  wickedness,  and  be  sorry  for  my  sin.  But  mine  enemies  live,  and 
are  mighty ;  and  they  that  hate  me  wrongfully  are  many  in  number.  They 
also  that  reward  evil  for  good  are  against  me ;  because  I  follow  the  thing 
that  good  is. 

Forsake  me  not,  0  Lord  my  God ;  be  not  thou  far  from  me.   Haste  thee 
to  help  me,  0  Lord  God  of  my  salvation.     (Twice.) 


Psalm  lxiii. 

0  God,  thou  art  my  God;  early  will  I  seek  thee.  My  soul  thirsteth  for 
thee;  my  flesh  also  longeth  after  thee,  in  a  barren  and  dry  land  where  no 
water  is.  Thus  have  I  looked  for  thee  in  holiness,  that  I  might  behold  thy 
power  and  glory.  For  thy  loving-kindness  is  better  than  the  life  itself: 
my  lips  shall  praise  thee.  As  long  as  I  live  will  I  magnify  thee  in  this 
manner,  and  lift  up  my  hands  in  thy  Name.  My  soul  shall  be  satisfied, 
even  as  it  were  with  marrow  and  fatness,  when  my  mouth  praiseth  thee 
with  joyful  lips.  Have  I  not  remembered  thee  in  my  bed,  and  thought 
upon  thee  when  I  was  waking?  Because  thou  hast  been  my  helper;  there- 
fore under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings  will  I  rejoice.  My  soul  hangeth  upon 
thee;  thy  right  hand  hath  upholden  me.  These  also  that  seek  the  hurt  of 
my  soul,  they  shall  go  under  the  earth.  Let  them  fall  upon  the  edge  of 
the  sword,  that  they  may  be  a  portion  for  foxes.  But  the  King  shall  re- 
joice in  God;  all  they  also  that  swear  by  him  shall  be  commended;  for  the 
mouth  of  them  that  speak  lies  shall  be  stopped.  In  the  night  watches 
have  I  trusted  in  thee:  For  thou  hast  been  my  helper,  and  under  the 
shadow  of  thy  wings  will  I  rejoice.  My  soul  cleaveth  unto  thee:  and  thy 
right  hand  shall  uphold  me. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.  Glory  to  thee,  O  God.  (Thrice,  without 
reverences.) 

Lord,  have  mercy-     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 


THE  ALL-NIGHT  VIGIL  SERVICE 


Psalm  lxxxviii. 
O  Lord  God  of  my 
salvation,  I  have  cried 
day  and  night  before 
thee:  O  let  my  prayer 
enter  into  thy  pre- 
sence, incline  thine 
ear  unto  my  calling; 
for  my  soul  is  full  of 
trouble,  and  my  life 
draweth  nigh  unto 
hell.  I  am  counted  as 
one  of  them  that  go 
down  into  the  pit, 
and  I  have  been  even 
as  a  man  that  hath 
no  strength.  Free 
among  the  dead,  like 
unto  them  that  are 
wounded,  and  lie  in 
the  grave,  who  are 
out  of  remembrance, 
and  are  cut  away 
from  thy  hand.  Thou 
hast  laid  me  in  the 
lowest  pit,  in  a  place 
of  darkness,  and  in  the 
deep.  Thine  indigna- 
tion lieth  hard  upon 
me,  and  thou  hast 
vexed  me  with  all  thy 
storms.  Thou  hast  put 
away  mine  acquaint- 
ance far  from  me,  and 
made  me  to  be  ab- 
horred of  them.  I  am 
so  fast  in  prison  that  I 
cannot  get  forth.  My 
sight  faileth  for  very 
trouble;  Lord,  I  have 
called  daily  upon  thee, 
I  have  stretched  forth 
my  hands  unto  thee. 
Dost  thou  show  won- 


The   Priest   now   saith,    secretly,    the   Morning 
Prayers;  the  first  three  in  the  Sanctuary. 

i. 
We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  Lord  our 
God,  who  hast  raised  us  up  from  our  beds, 
and  hast  put  into  our  mouths  the  word  of 
praise,  that  we  may  adore  and  call  upon  thy 
holy  Name.  And  we  entreat  thee,  by  thy  mer- 
cies which  thou  hast  exercised  always  in  our 
life,  send  down  now  also  thine  aid  upon 
those  who  stand  before  the  presence  of  thy 
holy  glory,  and  await  the  rich  mercy  which 
is  from  thee.  And  grant  that  they  may  always 
with  fear  and  love  worship  thee,  praise  thee, 
hymn  thee,  and  adore  thine  inexpressible 
goodness. 

For  unto  thee  is  due  all  honour,  glory  and 
worship,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and 
to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

ii. 

From  the  night  season  our  soul  awaketh 
early  unto  thee,  O  our  God;  for  thy  precepts 
are  a  light  upon  the  earth.  Teach  us  to  per- 
fect righteousness  and  holiness  in  thy  fear; 
for  we  glorify  thee,  our  God,  who  existest  in 
verity.  Incline  thine  ear  and  hear  us;  and 
call  to  remembrance  by  their  names,  O  Lord, 
all  those  who  are  with  us  and  pray  with  us; 
and  save  them  by  thy  might.  Bless  thy  peo- 
ple and  sanctify  thine  inheritance.  Grant 
peace  to  thy  world,  to  thy  Churches,  to  the 
priests,  to  the  Authorities,  and  to  all  thy 
people. 

For  blessed  and  glorified  is  thine  all-hon- 
ourable and  majestic  Name,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

in. 
In  the  night  season  our  soul  awaketh  early 
unto  thee,  O  God,  for  thy  precepts  are  light. 
Teach  us  thy  righteousness,  thy  command- 
ments and  thy  statutes,  O  God.     Enlighten 


ders  among  the  dead? 
or  shall  the  dead  rise 
up  again,  and  praise 
thee?  Shall  thy  loving- 
kindness  be  showed 
in  the  grave?  or  thy 
faithfulness  in  de- 
struction? Shall  thy 
wondrous  works  be 
known  in  the  dark? 
and  thy  righteousness 
in  the  land  where  all 
things  are  forgotten? 
Unto  thee  have  I 
cried,  O  Lord;  and 
early  shall  my  prayer 
come  before  thee. 
Lord,  why  abhorrest 
thou  my  soul,  and 
hidest  thou  thy  face 
from  me?  I  am  in 
misery,  and  like  unto 
him  that  is  at  the 
point  to  die;  even 
from  my  youth  up  thy 
terrors  have  I  suf- 
fered with  a  troubled 
mind.  Thy  wrathful 
displeasure  gosth 
over  me,  and  the  fear 
of  thee  hath  undone 
me.  They  came  round 
about  me  daily  like 
water,  and  compassed 
me  together  on  every 
side.  My  lovers  and 
friends  hast  thou  put 
away  from  me,  and 
hid  mine  acquaint- 
ance out  of  my  sight. 
O  Lord  God  of  my 
salvation  I  have  cried 
day  and  night  be- 
fore thee:  O  let  mv 


MATINS 

the  eyes  of  our  understanding,  lest  at  any 
time  we  sleep  unto  death  in  sins.  Dispel  all 
darkness  from  our  hearts.  Graciously  give 
unto  us  the  Sun  of  Righteousness,  and  pre- 
serve our  life  unassailed,  by  the  seal  of  thy 
Holy  Spirit.  Guide  our  steps  into  the  way 
of  peace.  Grant  us  to  behold  the  dawn  and 
the  day  with  joy,  that  we  may  raise  our 
morning  prayers  unto  thee. 

For  thine  is  the  dominion,  and  thine  are 
the  majesty  and  the  power  and  the  glory,  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

The  Priest  now  cometh  forth,  and  standing  with 
uncovered  head  before  the  Holy  Door,  he  saith 
the  remaining  Prayers. 

IV. 

O  Lord  God,  holy  and  unsearchable,  who 
didst  command  the  light  to  shine  forth  from 
the  darkness;  who  hast  refreshed  us  by  the 
slumber  of  the  night,  and  hast  raised  us  up 
to  glorify  and  supplicate  thy  goodness:  Being 
implored  of  thine  own  tender  loving-kindness, 
accept  us  also  now  who  bow  down  in  adora- 
tion before  thee,  and  render  thanks  unto  thee 
according  to  the  measure  of  our  strength ;  and 
grant  us  all  our  petitions  which  are  unto  sal- 
vation. Make  us  children  of  the  light,  and  of 
the  day,  and  heirs  of  thine  everlasting  good 
things.  Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  in  the 
multitude  of  thy  bounties,  all  thy  people  here 
present  with  us  who  make  their  supplications 
unto  thee,  and  all  our  brethren  on  land,  on 
the  sea,  and  in  every  place  of  thy  dominion, 
who  are  in  need  of  thy  loving-kindness  and 
of  thy  succour,  and  vouchsafe  unto  them 
all  thy  great  mercy,  that  being  always  pre- 
served in  safety  of  soul  and  body,  we  may 
with  boldness  magnify  thy  wondrous  and 
blessed  Name,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son, 
and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

THE  ALL-NIGHT  VIGIL  SERVICE 


prayer  enter  into 
thy  presence,  incline 
thine  ear  unto  my 
calling. 

Psalm  cm. 
Praise  the  Lord, 
O  my  soul;  and  all 
that  is  within  me, 
praise  his  holy  Name. 
Praise  the  Lord,  O 
my  soul,  and  forget 
not  all  his  benefits: 
who  forgiveth  all 
thy  sin,  and  healeth 
all  thine  infirmities; 
who  saveth  thy  life 
from  destruction,  and 
crowneth  thee  with 
mercy  and  loving- 
kindness;  who  satis- 
fieth  thy  mouth  with 
good  things,  making 
thee  young  and  lusty 
as  an  eagle.  The 
Lord  executeth  right- 
eousness and  judg- 
ment for  all  them  that 
are  oppressed  with 
wrong.  He  showed 
his  ways  unto  Moses, 
his  works  unto  the 
children  of  Israel.  The 
Lord  is  full  of  com- 
passion and  mercy, 
long-suffering,  and  of 
great  goodness.  He 
will  not  alway  be 
chiding;  neither  keep- 
eth  he  his  anger  for- 
ever. He  hath  not 
dealt  with  us  after 
our  sins;  nor  rewarded 
us   according   to   our 


For  thou  art  the  God  of  bounties  and  of  lov- 
ing-kindness, and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory, 
to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the 
Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 


O  Treasury  of  good  things,  Fountain  eter- 
nal, O  Father  all-holy  who  workest  wonders, 
all-powerful  and  almighty :  We  all  adore  thee 
and  entreat  thee,  calling  thy  mercies  and  thy 
compassion  to  the  aid  and  defence  of  our 
lowliness.  Call  to  remembrance  thy  serv- 
ants, O  Lord;  accept  the  morning  prayers 
of  us  all  as  incense  before  thee;  and  let  none 
of  us  be  found  reprobate,  but  encompass  us 
with  thy  bounties.  Call  to  remembrance,  O 
Lord,  those  who  watch  and  sing  praises  to 
thy  glory,  and  to  the  glory  of  thine  Only-be- 
gotten Son  who  is  our  God,  and  of  thy  Holy 
Spirit.  Be  thou  their  helper  and  their  sup- 
port. Receive  thou  their  supplications  upon 
thy  most  heavenly  and  spiritually  discerning 
altar. 

For  thou  art  our  God,  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son, 
and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

VI. 

We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  Lord  God  of 
our  salvation ;  for  thou  doest  all  things  which 
are  for  the  welfare  of  our  life,  that  we  may 
ever  look  upward  unto  thee,  our  Saviour  and 
the  Benefactor  of  our  souls.  For  thou  hast 
refreshed  us  in  that  part  of  the  night  which 
is  past,  and  hast  raised  us  up  from  our  beds, 
and  hast,  led  us  to  stand  here  in  adoration 
of  thy  precious  Name.  Wherefore  we  entreat 
thee,  O  Lord,  vouchsafe  unto  us  grace  and 
power,  that  we  may  be  enabled  with  under- 
standing to  sing  praises  unto  thee,  and  to 
pray  without  ceasing,  in  fear  and  trembling 
working  out  our  own  salvation,  through  the 


wickednesses.  For 
look  how  high  the 
heaven  is  in  compar- 
ison of  the  earth;  so 
great  is  his  mercy 
also  toward  them  that 
fear  him.  Look  how 
wide  also  the  east  is 
from  the  west:  so  far 
hath  he  set  our  sins 
from  us.  Yea,  like  as 
a  father  pitieth  his 
own  children;  even 
so  is  the  Lord  mer- 
ciful unto  them  that 
fear  him.  For  he 
knoweth  whereof  we 
are  made;  he  remem- 
bereth  that  we  are 
but  dust.  The  days  of 
man  are  but  as  grass; 
for  he  flourisheth  as 
a  flower  of  the  field. 
For  as  soon  as  the 
wind  goeth  over  it,

place  thereof  shall

the  merciful  goodness 
of  the  Lord  endureth

him;  and  his  right-

upon  such  as  keep  his 
covenant,  and  think 
upon  his  command- 
ments to  do  them.

succour  of  thy  Christ.  Call  to  remembrance, 
O  Lord,  those  who  cry  aloud  unto  thee  in 
the  night  season;  hearken  unto  them  and 
have  mercy,  and  crush  under  their  feet  in- 
visible and  warring  enemies. 

For  thou  art  the  King  of  Peace  and  the 
Saviour  of  our  souls,  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe 
glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to 
the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen.

O  God  and  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
who  hast  raised  us  up  from  our  beds,  and  hast 
gathered  us  together  at  this  hour  of  prayer: 
Grant  us  grace  in  the  opening  of  our  lips,  and 
accept  our  thanksgivings  as  we  have  power  to 
make  them;  and  instruct  us  in  thy  statutes. 
For  we  know  not  how  to  pray  as  we  ought 
unless  thou,  O  Lord,  by  thy  Holy  Spirit,  dost 
guide  us.  Wherefore  we  beseech  thee:  Par- 
don, remit,  forgive  whatsoever  sins  we  may 
have  committed  unto  this  present  hour, 
whether  by  word,  or  deed,  or  thought,  whether 
voluntarily  or  involuntarily;  for  if  thou  wilt 
be  extreme  to  mark  iniquity,  O  Lord,  Lord, 
who  shall  stand?  For  with  thee  is  redemp- 
tion .  For  thou  only  art  holy,  a  mighty  helper 
and  the  defender  of  our  life;  and  our  song 
shall  be  ever  of  thee. 

Blessed  and  glorified  be  the  might  of  thy 
kingdom,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

VIII. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  banished  from 
us  the  sluggishness  of  sleep,  and  hast  as- 
sembled us  together  by  a  holy  bidding,  that 
in  the  night-season  also  we  may  lift  up  our 
hands,  and  make  unto  thee  thankful  acknow- 
ledgment of  thy  righteous  judgments:  Accept 
our  prayers,  petitions,  confessions  of  thanks 
and  nocturnal  worship;  and  grant  unto  us,

In  all  places  of  his 
dominion,  praise  thou 
the  Lord,  O  my  soul. 
(Twice.) 

Psalm  cxliii. 
Hear  my  prayer,  O 
Lord,  and  consider 
my  desire;  hearken 
unto  me  for  thy  truth 
and  righteousness' 
sake.  And  enter  not 
into  judgment  with 
thy  servant;  for  in  thy 
sight  shall  no  man  liv- 
ing be  justified.  For 
the  enemy  hath  per- 
secuted my  soul;  he 
hath  smitten  my  life 
down  to  the  ground; 
he  hath  laid  me  in  the 
darkness,  as  the  men 
that  have  been  long 
dead.  Therefore  is  my 
spirit  vexed  within 
me,  and  my  heart 
within  me  is  desolate. 
Vet  do  I  remember 
the  time  past:  I  muse 


O  God,  faith  invincible,  love  unwavering,  hope 
unfeigned.  Bless  our  goings  out  and  our 
comings  in;  our  deeds  and  works,  and  words 
and  thoughts.  And  grant  that  we  may  come 
to  the  beginning  of  this  day  praising,  singing 
and  blessing  the  goodness  of  thine  ineffable 
beneficence. 

For  blessed  is  thine  all-holy  Name,  and  all- 
magnified  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and 
of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

IX. 

Illumine  our  hearts,  O  Sovereign  Master, 
who  lovest  man,  with  the  pure  light  of  thy 
wisdom,  and  open  the  eyes  of  our  understand- 
ing to  the  comprehension  of  the  proclama- 
tion of  thy  Gospel.  Implant  in  us,  also,  the 
fear  of  thy  blessed  commandments;  that 
trampling  down  all  carnal  appetites,  we  may 
lead  a  godly  life,  both  thinking  and  doing 
always  such  things  as  are  well  pleasing  in 
thy  sight. 

For  thou  art  the  sanctification  and  the 
illumination  both  of  our  souls  and  bodies,  O 
Christ  our  God,  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe 
glory,  together  with  thy  Father,  who  hath  no 
beginning,  and  thine  all-holy  and  blessed  and 
life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

x. 
O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  granted  unto 
men  pardon  through  repentance,  and  hast 
set  us,  as  an  example  of  the  acknowledgment 
of  sin  and  of  the  confession  which  is  unto 
forgiveness,  the  repentance  of  the  Prophet 
David:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  have  mercy 
upon  us  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  not- 
withstanding the  manifold  and  great  iniqui- 
ties into  which  we  have  fallen;  and  through 
the  multitude  of  thy  bounties,  blot  out  our 
transgressions.  For  unto  thee  have  we 
sinned,  O  Lord,  who  knowest  the  secret  and 


upon  all  thy  works; 
yea,  I  exercise  myself 
in  the  works  of  thy 
hands.  I  stretch  forth 
my  hands  unto  thee; 
my  soul  gaspeth  unto 
thee  as  a  thirsty  land. 
Hear  me,  O  Lord, 
and  that  soon ;  for  my 
spirit  waxeth  faint : 
hide  not  thy  face  from 
me,  lest  I  be  like  unto 
them  that  go  down 
into  the  pit.  O  let  me 
hear  thy  loving-kind- 
ness betimes  in  the 
morning;  for  in  thee 
is  my  trust :  show  thou 
me  the  way  that  I 
should  walk  in;  for  I 
lift  up  my  soul  unto 
thee.  Deliver  me,  O 
Lord,  from  mine  ene- 
mies; for  I  flee  unto 
thee  to  hide  me. 
Teach  me  to  do  the 
thing  that  pleaseth 
thee;  for  thou  art  my 
God:  let  thy  loving 
Spirit  lead  me  forth 
into  the  land  of  right- 
eousness. Quicken 
me,  O  Lord,  for  thy 
Name's  sake:  and  for 
thy  righteousness' 
sake  bring  my  soul 
out  of  trouble.  And 
of  thy  goodness  slay 
mine  enemies,  and  de- 
stroy all  them  that  vex 
my  soul ;  for  I  am  thy 
servant. 

Hearken    unto    me 
in  thy  righteousness,

alone  hast  power  to  remit  sins;  and  as  thou 
hast  created  a  clean  heart  within  us,  and 
established  us  with  thy  guiding  Spirit,  and 
made  known  unto  us  the  joy  of  salvation,  cast 
thou  us  not  away  from  thy  presence.  But 
inasmuch  as  thou  art  good  and  lovest  man, 
graciously  vouchsafe  unto  us  that  even  until 
our  uttermost  breath,  we  may  offer  unto 
thee  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  and  an 
offering  upon  thy  holy  altars.

Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together

Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

XI. 

O  God,  our  God,  who  hast  brought  into 
being  by  thy  will  all  the  powers  endowed 
with  speech  and  reason,  we  beseech  thee  and 
supplicate  thee:  Accept  our  praises,  which 
together  with  all  thy  creatures  we  offer  ac- 
cording to  our  strength;  and  reward  us  with 
the  rich  gifts  of  thy  goodness.  For  unto  thee 
every  knee  doth  bow,  whether  in  heaven  or 
on  the  earth,  or  in  the  regions  under  the 
earth,  and  every  breath  and  created  being 
doth  sing  thine  ineffable  glory.  For  thou 
only  art  the  true  and  most  merciful  God. 

For  all  the  powers  of  heaven  magnify  thee, 
and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,

We  praise  thee,  we  hymn  thee,  we  bless 
thee,  we  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  God  of  our 
fathers,  that  thou  hast  brought  us  in  safety 
through  the  shades  of  night,  and  hast  shown 
unto  us  once  again  the  light  of  day.  And  we

the  Apostles  the  Resurrection.    1$ 

The  Myrrh-bearing  Women  mourned  as,  bearing  unguents, 
they  drew  near  thy  tomb,  O  Saviour.  But  the  Angel  spake  unto 
them,  saying:  Why  number  ye  the  living  among  the  dead?  In  that 
he  is  God  he  is  risen  from  the  grave.    1$

Choir.  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord,  and  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in 
God  my  Saviour. 

Refrain.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

For  he  hath  regarded  the  lowliness  of  his  handmaiden ;  for  behold  from 
henceforth  all  generations  shall  call  me  blessed. 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  .  .  . 

For  he  that  is  mighty  hath  magnified  me,  and  holy  is  his  Name;  and  his 
mercy  is  on  them  that  fear  him,  throughout  all  generations.    Ц 

He  hath  showed  strength  with  his  arm ;  he  hath  scattered  the  proud  in 
the  imagination  of  their  hearts.    1$ 

He  hath  put  down  the  mighty  from  their  seat,  and  hath  exalted  the

rich  hath  he  sent  empty  away.    1$

Blessed  be  the  Lord  God  of  Israel,  for  he  hath  visited  and  redeemed  his 
people;  and  hath  raised  up  a  mighty  salvation  for  us,  in  the  house  of  his 
servant  David ;  as  he  spake  by  the  mouth  of  his  holy  prophets,  which  have 
been  since  the  world  began;  that  we  should  be  saved  from  our  enemies, 
and  from  the  hand  of  all  that  hate  us.  To  perform  the  mercy  promised  to 
our  forefathers,  and  to  remember  his  holy  covenant;  to  perform  the  oath 
which  he  sware  to  our  forefather  Abraham  that  he  would  give  us;  that  we 
being  delivered  out  of  the  hand  of  our  enemies,  might  serve  him  without 
fear;  in  holiness  and  righteousness  before  him  all  the  days  of  our  life.  And 
thou,  child,  shalt  be  called  the  prophet  of  the  Highest,  for  thou  shalt  go 
before  the  face  of  the  Lord  to  prepare  his  ways!  To  give  knowledge  of 
salvation  unto  his  people,  for  the  remission  of  their  sins,  through  the 
tender  mercy  of  our  God,  whereby  the  day-spring  from  on  high  hath 
visited  us :  to  give  light  to  them  that  sit  in  darkness  and  in  the  shadow  of 
death,  and  to  guide  our  feet  into  the  way  of  peace.

Most  blessed  art  thou,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God:  For  through  him 
who  became  incarnate  of  thee  Hell  is  led  captive,  Adam  is  recalled  from 
the  dead,  the  curse  is  made  void,  Eve  is  set  free,  Death  is  slain,  and  we 
have  been  endowed  with  life.  Wherefore  we  cry  aloud,  extolling  in  song: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Christ  our  God,  in  whose  sight  it  is  thus  well-pleasing. 
Glory  to  thee.

give  thanks  to  thee  for  thy  great  glory,  O  Lord  God,  heavenly  King,  God 
the  Father  Almighty.  O  Lord,  the  only-begotten  Son  Jesus  Christ,  and 
the  Holy  Spirit;  O  Lord  God,  Lamb  of  God,  Son  of  the  Father,  that  takest 
away  the  sins  of  the  world,  have  mercy  upon  us.  Thou  that  takest  away 
the  sins  of  the  world,  receive  our  prayer.  Thou  that  sittest  at  the  right 
hand  of  God  the  Father,  have  mercy  upon  us.  For  thou  only  art  holy; 
thou  only  art  the  Lord,  thou  only,  O  Jesus  Christ,  art  most  high  in  the 
glory  of  God  the  Father.     Amen. 

Every  day  will  I  give  thanks  unto  thee,  and  praise  thy  Name  forever 
and  ever.  Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge  from  one  generation  to 
another.  I  said,  Lord,  be  merciful  unto  me;  heal  my  soul,  for  I  have 
sinned  against  thee.  I  flee  unto  thee.  Teach  me  to  do  thy  will ;  for  thou 
art  my  God.  For  with  thee  is  the  well  of  life,  and  in  thy  light  shall  we  see

To-day  is  salvation  come  into  the  world.     Let  us  sing  praises  unto  him 
who  rose  again  from  the  grave,  the  Author  of  our  life:  For  in  that  by  death 
he  hath  destroyed  Death,  he  hath  given  unto  us  the  victory  and  great 
mercy. 

In  Tones  II.,  IV.,  VI. ,  VIII.: 

When  thou  hadst  risen  again  from  the  tomb,  and  hadst  burst  the  bonds 
of  Hell,  thou  didst  loose  the  condemnation  of  death,  O  Lord,  redeeming 
all  men  from  the  snares  of  the  enemy.  When  thou  hadst  revealed  thy- 
self to  thine  Apostles,  thou  didst  send  them  forth  to  proclaim  thee.  And 
through  them  thou  hast  granted  thy  peace  unto  the  universe,  O  only  All- 
merciful  One.

Thee  have  we  bowed  the  neck  of  our  soul  and  body,  and  we  entreat 
thee :  Stretch  forth  thine  invisible  hand  from  thy  holy  dwelling-place 
and  bless  us  all.  And  if  in  aught  we  have  sinned,  whether  voluntarily 
or  involuntarily,  forgive,  inasmuch  as  thou  art  a  good  God,  and  lovest

we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Choir.  Bless. 

Priest.  He  who  in  verity  existeth,  even  Christ  our  God,  is  blessed 
always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Establish,  O  Lord,  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  and  the  Holy  Ortho- 
dox faith,  and  Orthodox  Christians,  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Priest.  Save  us,  O  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  in  very  truth  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  our  sure  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)     Bless. 

Then  the  Priest  bestoweth  the  Benediction.     On  Saturday  Evening: 

May  he  who  rose  again  from  the  dead,  Christ  our  true  God;  through 
the  prayers  of  his  most  holy  Mother,  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-praise- 
worthy Apostles,  of  Saint  N.  (the  Patron  of  the  Church) ;  of  Saint  N.  (the 
Saint  of  the  Day) ;  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us; 
inasmuch  as  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

Then  the  Choir  singeth  the  Many  Years: 

Preserve,  O  Lord,  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler;  our  (Patriarch,  or  Holy 
Synod) ;  our  (Metropolitan,  Archbishop,  or  Bishop),  N.;  and  all  Orthodox 
Christians,  for  many  years. 

The  Holy  Doors  or  curtain  shall  be  closed,  and  The  First  Hour  is  then  read. 


THE  FIRST  HOUR* 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ  our  King,  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  {Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  v. 

Ponder  my  words,  O  Lord,  consider  my  meditation.  O  hearken  thou 
unto  the  voice  of  my  calling,  my  King,  and  my  God :  for  unto  thee  will  I 
make  my  prayer.  My  voice  shalt  thou  hear  betimes,  O  Lord ;  early  in  the 
morning  will  I  direct  my  prayer  unto  thee,  and  will  look  up.  For  thou 
art  the  God  that  hast  no  pleasure  in  wickedness;  neither  shall  any  evil 
dwell  with  thee.  Such  as  be  foolish  shall  not  stand  in  thy  sight;  for  thou 
hatest  all  them  that  work  vanity.  Thou  shalt  destroy  them  that  speak 
lies:  the  Lord  will  abhor  both  the  blood-thirsty  and  deceitful  man.  But  as 
for  me,  I  will  come  into  thine  house,  even  upon  the  multitude  of  thy 
mercy;  and  in  thy  fear  will  I  worship  toward  thy  holy  temple.  Lead  me, 
O  Lord,  in  thy  righteousness,  because  of  mine  enemies;  make  thy  way 
plain  before  my  face.  For  there  is  no  faithfulness  in  his  mouth;  their 
inward  parts  are  very  wickedness.  Their  throat  is  an  open  sepulchre; 
they  flatter  with  their  tongue.  Destroy  thou  them,  O  God;  let  them 
perish  through  their  own  imaginations ;  cast  them  out  in  the  multitude  of 
their  ungodliness;  for  they  have  rebelled  against  thee.  And  let  all  them 
that  put  their  trust  in  thee  rejoice:  they  shall  ever  be  giving  of  thanks, 
because  thou  defendest  them;  they  that  love  thy  Name  shall  be  joyful  in 
thee;  for  thou,  Lord,  wilt  give  thy  blessing  unto  the  righteous,  and  with 
thy  favourable  kindness  wilt  thou  defend  him,  as  with  a  shield. 

Psalm  xc. 
Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge,  from  one  generation  to  another.  Be- 
fore the  mountains  were  brought  forth,  or  ever  the  earth  and  the  world 
were  made,  thou  art  God  from  everlasting,  and  world  without  end.  Thou 
turnest  man  to  destruction;  again  thou  sayest,  Come  again,  ye  children 
of  men.  For  a  thousand  years  in  thy  sight  are  but  as  yesterday;  seeing 
that  is  past  as  a  watch  in  the  night.  As  soon  as  thou  scatterest  them  they 
are  even  as  a  sleep ;  and  fade  away  suddenly  like  the  grass.  In  the  morn- 
ing it  is  green,  and  groweth  up;  but  in  the  evening  it  is  cut  down,  dried 
up,  and  withered.  For  we  consume  away  in  thy  displeasure,  and  are 
afraid  at  thy  wrathful  indignation.  Thou  hast  set  our  misdeeds  before 
thee;  and  our  secret  sins  in  the  light  of  thy  countenance.     For  when  thou 

*  See  Appendix  B,  III. 


THE  FIRST  HOUR  39 

art  angry  all  our  days  are  gone:  we  bring  our  years  to  an  end,  as  it  were  a 
tale  that  is  told.  The  days  of  our  age  are  threescore  years  and  ten;  and 
though  men  be  so  strong  that  they  come  to  fourscore  years,  yet  is  their 
strength  then  but  labour  and  sorrow;  so  soon  passeth  it  away,  and  we  are 
gone.  But  who  regardeth  the  power  of  thy  wrath?  for  even  thereafter 
as  a  man  feareth,  so  is  thy  displeasure.  So  teach  us  to  number  our  days, 
that  we  may  apply  our  hearts  unto  wisdom.  Turn  thee  again,  O  Lord,  at 
the  last,  and  be  gracious  unto  thy  servants.  O  satisfy  us  with  thy  mercy, 
and  that  soon:  so  shall  we  rejoice  and  be  glad  all  the  days  of  our  life. 
Comfort  us  again  now  after  the  time  that  thou  hast  plagued  us;  and  for  the 
years  wherein  we  have  suffered  adversity.  Show  thy  servants  thy  work, 
and  their  children  thy  glory.  And  the  glorious  Majesty  of  the  Lord  our 
God  be  upon  us:  prosper  thou  the  work  of  our  hands  upon  us;  O  prosper 
thou  our  handy-work. 

Psalm  ci.  . 

My  song  shall  be  of  mercy  and  judgment;  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  will  I 
sing.  O  let  me  have  understanding  in  the  way  of  godliness!  When  wilt 
thou  come  unto  me?  I  will  walk  in  my  house  with  a  perfect  heart.  I  will 
take  no  wicked  thing  in  hand;  I  hate  the  sins  of  unfaithfulness;  there  shall 
no  such  cleave  unto  me.  A  froward  heart  shall  depart  from  me;  I  will 
not  know  a  wicked  person.  Whoso  privily  slandereth  his  neighbour,  him 
will  I  destroy.  Whoso  hath  also  a  proud  look  and  high  stomach,  I  will 
not  suffer  him.  Mine  eyes  look  upon  such  as  are  faithful  in  the  land,  that 
they  may  dwell  with  me.  Whoso  leadeth  a  godly  life,  he  shall  be  my 
servant.  There  shall  no  deceitful  person  dwell  in  my  house;  he  that 
telleth  lies  shall  not  tarry  in  my  sight.  I  shall  soon  destroy  all  the  un- 
godly that  are  in  the  land ;  that  I  may  root  out  all  wicked  doers  from  the 
city  of  the  Lord. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.  Glory  to  thee,  O  God.  {Thrice;  three  rev- 
erences.) 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Then  the  Hymn  (Tropdr)  for  the  Day,  in  the  proper  Tone,  is  read* 
Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 
What  shall  we  call  thee,  O  thou  who  art  full  of  grace?  Heaven,  for 
from  thee  shone  forth  the  Sun  of  Righteousness;  Paradise,  for  thou  hast 
budded  forth  the  Flower  of -Immortality;  Virgin,  for  thou  hast  remained 
undefiled:  Pure  Mother,  for  thou  hast  held  in  thy  holy  embrace  thy  Son, 
who  is  God  of  all.  Beseech  thou  him  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 
*  For  the  Hymns  in  the  Eight  Tones,  see  Appendix  A.

40  THE  FIRST  HOUR 

But  if  it  be  during  Great  Fast  (Lent),  we  say  the  Hymn  (Tropdr)  in  Tone  VI. 

Then:  O  hearken  thou  betimes  unto  the  voice  of  my  calling,  my 
King  and  my  God. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1 :  Ponder  my  words,  O  Lord :  consider  my  medita- 
tion. 

Verse  2 :  For  unto  thee  will  I  make  my  prayer. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  again  the  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God:  What  shall  we  call  thee: 

Order  my  steps  in  thy  word,  and  so  shall  no  wickedness  have  dominion 
over  me.  O  deliver  me  from  the  wrongful  dealings  of  men,  and  so  shall  I 
keep  thy  commandments.  Show  the  light  of  thy  countenance  upon  thy 
servant,  and  teach  me  thy  statutes. 

Let  my  mouth  be  filled  with  thy  praise,  O  Lord,  that  I  may  sing  of  thy 
glory  and  honour  all  the  day  long. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  in- 
firmities, for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)     Glory         now,  and  ever 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Amen.    Lord,  have  mercy.    (Twelve  times.)   Glory  now  and  ever. 

If  it  be  not  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  of  the  Tone,  or  of  the 
Saint  for  the  Day,  or  of  the  approaching  Feast,  is  then  read* 

But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast,  or  if  there  be  no  special  Collect-Hymn,  on  Monday, 
Tuesday  and  Thursday,  the  following  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God 
(Bogoroditchen)  shall  be  read: 

With  heart  and  lips  let  us  continually  magnify  the  glorious  Mother 
of  God,  more  holy  than  the  Angels,  confessing  her  to  be  the  Birth- 
giver  of  God,  who  did,  in  very  truth,  bring  forth  God  incarnate,  and 
who  unceasingly  doth  intercede  for  our  souls.

THE  FIRST  HOUR  41 

But  on  Wednesday  and  Friday  the  following  shall  be  read: 
Speedily  prevent,  ere  he  lead  us  into  captivity,  the  enemy  which 
blasphemeth  thee  and  constraineth  us,  O  Christ  our  God:  Overcome 
by  thy  Cross  those  who  war  against  us,  that  they  may  know  what 
power  hath  the  faith  of  Orthodox  believers ;  through  the  intercessions 
of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  O  thou  who  alone  lovest  mankind. 

On  Saturday  the  following  shall  be  said: 

Unto  thee,  O  Lord,  the  Author  of  Creation,  the  universe  doth  offer 
the  God-bearing  martyrs  as  the  first-fruits  of  nature.  By  whose 
prayers,  through  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  do  thou  preserve  in  peace 
profound  thy  Church,  which  is  thine  estate,  O  most  merciful  One. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Forty  times.) 

Thou  who,  at  all  times,  and  at  every  hour,  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth, 
art  worshipped  and  glorified,  O  Christ-God,  long-suffering  and  plenteous 
in  mercy  and  compassion;  who  lovest  the  just  and  showest  mercy  to  those 
who  are  hardened  in  sin ;  who  callest  all  men  to  salvation  through  the  pro- 
mise of  good  things  to  come:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  receive  also  our 
supplications  at  this  present  time,  and  direct  our  lives  according  to  thy 
commandments.  Sanctify  our  souls;  purify  our  bodies;  set  aright  our 
minds;  cleanse  our  thoughts;  and  deliver  us  from  all  calamity,  wrath  and 
distress.  Compass  us  round  about  with  thy  holy  Angels;  that,  guided 
and  guarded  by  their  host,  we  may  attain  unto  the  unity  of  the  faith,  and 
unto  the  comprehension  of  thine  ineffable  glory.  For  blessed  art  thou 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.     Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glori- 
ous than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

In  the  Name  of  the  Lord  bless,  Father. 

Priest.  God  be  bountiful  unto  us,  and  bless  us,  and  show  us  the  light 
of  his  countenance,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

And  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast,  we  make  three  great  reverences  to  the  earth,  reciting 
the  prescribed 

Prayer  of  St.  Ephraim  the  Syrian. 

O  Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  grant  not  unto  me  a  spirit  of  slothful- 
ness,  of  discouragement,  of  lust  of  power,  of  vain  babbling.  {Rever- 
ence.) 

But  vouchsafe  unto  me  thy  servant  the  spirit  of  continence,  of 
meekness,  of  patience,  and  of  love.     {Reverence.) 

Yea,  O  Lord  and  King,  grant  that  I  may  perceive  my  own  trans- 
gressions, and  judge  not  my  brother.  For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages 
of  ages.     Amen.     {Reverence.     Then  twelve  lesser  reverences,  saying  at

And  this  Prayer: 

O  Christ,  the  true  Light,  which  illumineth  and  sanctifieth  every  man  who 
cometh  into  the  world !  Let  the  light  of  thy  countenance  be  showed  upon 
us,  that  in  it  we  may  behold  the  light  ineffable ;  and  guide  our  footsteps

Mother;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles  (and  of  the  Saint 
to  whom  the  church  is  dedicated;  and  of  the  Saint  for  the  day) ;  of  the  holy

After  the  Priest  hath  bestowed  the  blessing,  we  say: 

Amen.     Glory  to  thee,  our  God ;  glory  to  thee. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come  and

prayer,  that  goeth  not  out  of  feigned  lips.  Let  my  sentence  come  forth 
from  thy  presence;  and  let  thine  eyes  look  upon  the  thing  that  is  equal. 
Thou  hast  proved  and  visited  mine  heart  in  the  night-season;  thou  hast 
tried  me,  and  shalt  find  no  wickedness  in  me;  for  I  am  utterly  purposed 
that  my  mouth  shall  not  offend.  Because  of  men's  works  that  are  done 
against  the  words  of  thy  lips,  I  have  kept  me  from  the  ways  of  the  de- 
stroyer. O  hold  thou  up  my  goings  in  thy  paths,  that  my  footsteps  slip 
not.  I  have  called  upon  thee,  O  God,  for  thou  shalt  hear  me:  incline 
thine  ear  to  me,  and  hearken  unto  my  words.  Show  thy  marvellous  lov- 
ing-kindness, thou  that  art  the  Saviour  of  them  which  put  their  trust  in 
thee,  from  such  as  resist  thy  right  hand.  Keep  me  as  the  apple  of  an  eye; 
hide  me  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings,  from  the  ungodly,  that  trouble 
me;  mine  enemies  compass  me  round  about,  to  take  away  my  soul.  They 
are  inclosed  in  their  own  fat,  and  their  mouth  speaketh  proud  things. 
They  lie  waiting  in  our  way  on  every  side,  turning  their  eyes  down  to  the 
ground;  like  as  a  lion  that  is  greedy  of  his  prey,  and  as  it  were  a  lion's 
whelp  lurking  in  secret  places.  Up,  Lord,  disappoint  him,  and  cast  him 
down;  deliver  my  soul  from  the  ungodly,  which  is  a  sword  of  thine;  from 
the  men  of  thy  hand,  O  Lord,  from  the  men,  I  say,  and  from  the  evil 
world ;  which  have  their  portion  in  this  life,  whose  bellies  thou  fillest  with 
thy  hid  treasure.  They  have  children  at  their  desire,  and  leave  the  rest 
of  their  substance  for  their  babes.  But  as  for  me,  I  will  behold  thy  pre- 
sence in  righteousness;  and  when  I  awake  up  after  thy  likeness,  I  shall  be 
satisfied  with  it. 

Psalm  xxv. 

Unto  thee,  O  Lord,  will  I  lift  up  my  soul;  my  God,  I  have  put  my  trust 
in  thee:  O  let  me  not  be  confounded,  neither  let  mine  enemies  triumph 
over  me.  For  all  they  that  hope  in  thee  shall  not  be  ashamed ;  but  such  as 
transgress  without  a  cause  shall  be  put  to  confusion.  Show  me  thy  ways, 
O  Lord,  and  teach  me  thy  paths.  Lead  me  forth  in  thy  truth,  and  learn 
me :  for  thou  art  the  God  of  my  salvation ;  in  thee  hath  been  my  hope  all 
the  day  long.  Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  thy  tender  mercies,  and  thy 
loving-kindnesses,  which  have  been  ever  of  old.  O  remember  not  the  sins 
and  offences  of  my  youth;  but  according  to  thy  mercy  think  thou  upon 
me,  O  Lord,  for  thy  goodness.  Gracious  and  righteous  is  the  Lord;  there- 
fore will  he  teach  sinners  in  the  way.  Them  that  are  meek  shall  he  guide 
in  judgment;  and  such  as  are  gentle,  them  shall  he  learn  his  way.  All  the 
paths  of  the  Lord  are  mercy  and  truth,  unto  such  as  keep  his  covenant, 
and  his  testimonies.  For  thy  Name's  sake,  O  Lord,  be  merciful  unto  my 
sin;  for  it  is  great.  What  man  is  he  that  feareth  the  Lord?  him  shall  he 
teach  in  the  way  that  he  shall  choose.  His  soul  shall  dwell  at  ease,  and 
his  seed  shall  inherit  the  land.  The  secret  of  the  Lord  is  among  them  that 
fear  him;  and  he  will  show  them  his  covenant.  Mine  eyes  are  ever  look- 
ing unto  the  Lord ;  for  he  shall  pluck  my  feet  out  of  the  net.     Turn  thee 


THE  THIRD  HOUR  45 

unto  me,  and  have  mercy  upon  me;  for  I  am  desolate,  and  in  misery.  The 
sorrows  of  my  heart  are  enlarged :  0  bring  thou  me  out  of  my  troubles. 
Look  upon  my  adversity  and  misery,  and  forgive  me  all  my  sin.  Consider 
mine  enemies,  how  many  they  are;  and  they  bear  a  tyrannous  hate  against 
me.  0  keep  my  soul,  and  deliver  me:  let  me  not  be  confounded,  for  I 
have  put  my  trust  in  thee.  Let  perfectness  and  righteous  dealing  wait 
upon  me;  for  my  hope  hath  been  in  thee.  Deliver  Israel,  O  God,  out  of 
all  his  troubles. 

Psalm  li. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according  to  the 
multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me  throughly 
from  my  wickedness,  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I  acknowledge  my 
faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned, 
and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justified  in  thy  say- 
ing, and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold,  I  was  shapen  in  wickedness, 
and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou  requirest  truth  in 
the  inward  parts,  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand  wisdom  secretly. 
Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean;  thou  shalt  wash 
me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow.  Thou  shalt  make  me  hear  of  joy 
and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may  rejoice.  Turn 
thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds.  Make  me  a  clean 
heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast  me  not  away 
from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy  Holy  Spirit  from  me.  O  give  me  the 
comfort  of  thy  help  again,  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free  Spirit.  Then 
shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked,  and  sinners  shall  be  converted 
unto  thee.  Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou  that  art  the 
God  of  my  health ;  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  Thou 
shalt  open  my  lips,  O  Lord,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy  praise.  For 
thou  desirest  no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou  delightest  not 
in  burnt-offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled  spirit:  a  broken  and 
contrite  heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be  favourable  and  gra- 
cious unto  Sion;  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem.  Then  shalt  thou  be 
pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with  the  burnt-offerings  and 
oblations;  then  shall  they  offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine  altar. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.     Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     {Thrice.) 

Lord,  have  mercy.  {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.

46  THE  THIRD  HOUR 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 

O  Birth-giver  of  God,  thou  art  the  true  Vine  who  didst  bud  forth  for  us 

the  Fruit  of  Life:  Implore  thou  him,  we  beseech  thee,  O  Lady,  together 

with  the  Apostles  and  all  the  Saints,  that  he  will  have  mercy  on  our  souls. 

But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  then  this  Hymn  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  VI.,  is  said: 

O  Lord,  who  at  the  Third  Hour  didst  send  down  upon  thine  Apos- 
tles thy  Holy  Spirit :  Take  not  the  same  from  us,  O  Good  One,  but  re- 
new Him  in  us  who  make  our  supplications  unto  thee. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1 :  Make  me  a  clean  heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right 
spirit  within  me. 

Verse  2 :  Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy 
Holy  Spirit  from  me. 

And  to  these  we  add:  O  Lord,  who  at  the  Third  Hour:  and  the  rest  of  the  Hymn 
again,  to  the  end,  making  one  reverence  for  each. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  again  the  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen):  O  Birth- 
giver  of  God,  thou  art  the  true  Vine.     .  . 

Praised  be  the  Lord  God,  praised  be  the  Lord  daily,  the  God  of  our  salva- 
tion: who  helpeth  us:  our  God  is  the  God  of  whom  cometh  salvation.  He 
is  our  God,  even  the  God  of  our  salvation. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  .  .  O  all-holy  Trinity,  .  .  . 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Then  (as  at  the  beginning  of  the  Hour) : 
Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever.  .  .  .  Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven  .  .  . 
Then  the  Collect  Hymn  (Konddk)  of  the  Day,  or  of  the  Saint* 
But  if  ii  be  a  Fast,  we  say  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  VIII.: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Christ  our  God,  who  hast  revealed  fishers  most 
wise,  sending  down  upon  them  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  thereby  catching 
the  universe  as  in  a  net.     O  thou,  who  lovest  mankind,  glory  to  thee. 
Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Grant  speedy  and  steadfast  consolation  unto  thy  servants,  O  Jesus, 
when  our  spirit  is  cast  down  within  us.     Depart  not  from  our  souls  in 
affliction ;  be  not  far  from  our  thoughts  in  time  of  trouble ;  but  always 
defend  us.     Draw  near  unto  us,  draw  near  unto  us,  thou  who  art  om- 
nipresent!   As  thou  art  ever  with  thine  Apostles,  so,  also,  O  Bountiful 
One,  unite  thyself  unto  those  who  long  for  thee;  that  with  one  accord 
we  may  sing  praises  unto  thee,  and  laud  thy  most  holy  Spirit. 
Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

Wall  Impregnable  and  the  Haven  unvexed  by  storms,  O  most  pure 
Birth-giver  of  God ;  but  in  that  thou  dost  save  the  world  by  thine  un- 
ceasing intercessions,  call  thou  us  also  to  remembrance,  O  Virgin,  all- 
lauded. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Forty  times.) 

Thou  who,  at  all  times,  and  at  every  hour,  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth 
art  worshipped  and  glorified,  O  Christ-God,  long-suffering,  plenteous  in 
mercy  and  compassion;  who  lovest  the  just  and  showest  mercy  to  those 
who  are  hardened  in  sin ;  who  callest  all  men  to  salvation  through  the  pro- 
mise of  good  things  to  come:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  receive  also  our 
supplications  at  this  present  time,  and  direct  our  lives  according  to  thy 
commandments;  sanctify  our  souls;  purify  our  bodies;  set  aright  our 
minds;  cleanse  our  thoughts;  and  deliver  us  from  all  calamity,  wrath  and 
distress.  Compass  us  round  about  with  thy  holy  Angels;  that,  guided 
and  guarded  by  their  host,  we  may  attain  unto  the  unity  of  the  faith,  and 
unto  the  comprehension  of  thine  ineffable  glory.  For  blessed  art  thou 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  more  glorious  beyond  com- 
pare than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

In  the  Name  of  the  Lord  bless,  Father. 

Priest.  Through  the  prayers  of  our  Holy  Fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

And  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  {Lent),  we  make  three  great  reverences,  reciting  the 
prescribed 

Prayer  of  St.  Ephraim  the  Syrian. 

O  Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  grant  not  unto  me  a  spirit  of  slothful- 
ness,  of  discouragement,  of  lust  of  power,  of  vain  babbling.  {Rever- 
ence.) 

But  vouchsafe  unto  me,  thy  servant,  the  spirit  of  continence,  of 
meekness,  of  patience,  and  of  love.     {Reverence.) 

Yea,  O  Lord  and  King,  grant  that  I  may  perceive  my  own  trans- 
gressions, and  judge  not  my  brother.  For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages 
of  ages.  Amen.  {Reverence.  Then  twelve  lesser  reverences,  saying  at 
each:  O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner.  Then  the  whole  Prayer  is  re- 
peated; with  one  great  reverence  in  conclusion.) 

And  when  we  have  finished  the  reverences,  we  say  this 
Prayer  of  St.  Mardarius. 

O  Lord  God,  Father  almighty,  O  Lord  the  Only-begotten  Son, 
Jesus  Christ,  and  O  Holy  Spirit,  one  Godhead,  one  Power,  have  mercy

upon  me,  a  sinner.  And  by  the  judgments  which  thou  hast  estab- 
lished, save  me,  thine  unworthy  servant.  For  blessed  art  thou  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen.

THE  SIXTH  HOUR* 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  (Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  liv. 

Save  me,  O  God,  for  thy  Name's  sake,  and  avenge  me  in  thy  strength. 
Hear  my  prayer,  O  God,  and  hearken  unto  the  words  of  my  mouth.  For 
strangers  are  risen  up  against  me;  and  tyrants,  which  have  not  God  before 
their  eyes,  seek  after  my  soul.  Behold,  God  is  my  helper;  the  Lord  is  with 
them  that  uphold  my  soul.  He  shall  reward  evil  unto  mine  enemies:  de- 
stroy thou  them  in  thy  truth.  An  offering  of  a  free  heart  will  I  give  thee, 
and  praise  thy  Name,  O  Lord ;  because  it  is  so  comfortable.  For  he  hath 
delivered  me  out.  of  all  my  trouble,  and  mine  eye  hath  seen  his  desire  upon 
mine  enemies. 

Psalm  lv. 
Hear  my  prayer,  O  God,  and  hide  not  thyself  from  my  petition.     Take 
heed  unto  me,  and  hear  me,  how  I  mourn  in  my  prayer,  and  am  vexed. 
The  enemy  crieth  so,  and  the  ungodly  cometh  on  so  fast;  for  they  are 
minded  to  do  me  some  mischief,  so  maliciously  are  they  set  against  me. 
My  heart  is  disquieted  within  me,  and  the  fear  of  death  is  fallen  upon  me. 
Fearfulness  and  trembling  are  come  upon  me,  and  an  horrible  dread  hath 
overwhelmed  me.     And  I  said,  Oh  that  I  had  wings  like  a  dove!  for  then 
would  I  flee  away,  and  be  at  rest.     Lo,  then  would  I  get  me  away  far  off, 
and  remain  in  the  wilderness.     I  would  make  haste  to  escape,  because  of 
the  stormy  wind  and  tempest.      Destroy  their    tongues,  O  Lord,  and 
divide  them,  for  I  have  spied  unrighteousness  and  strife  in  the  city.     Day 
and  night  they  go  about  within  the  walls  thereof:  mischief  also  and  sorrow 
are  in  the  midst  of  it.     Wickedness  is  therein ;  deceit  and  guile  go  not  out 
of  their  streets.     For  it  is  not  an  open  enemy  that  hath  done  me  this  dis- 
honour; for  then  I  could  have  borne  it:  neither  was  it  mine  adversary  that 
did  magnify  himself  against  me ;  for  then  peradventure  I  would  have  hid 
myself  from  him:  but  it  was  even  thou,  my  companion,  my  guide,  and 
mine  own  familiar  friend.     We  took  sweet  counsel  together,  and  walked 
in  the  house  of  God  as  friends.     Let  death  come  hastily  upon  them  and 

*  See  Appendix  B,  III. 


THE  SIXTH  HOUR  49 

let  them  go  down  quick  into  hell ;  for  wickedness  is  in  their  dwellings,  and 
among  them.  As  for  me,  I  will  call  upon  God,  and  the  Lord  shall  save  me. 
In  the  evening,  and  morning,  and  at  noon-day  will  I  pray,  and  that  in- 
stantly; and  he  shall  hear  my  voice.  It  is  he  that  hath  delivered  my  soul 
in  peace  from  the  battle  that  was  against  me;  for  there  were  many  with 
me.  Yea,  even  God,  that  endureth  forever,  shall  hear  me,  and  bring 
them  down;  for  they  will  not  turn,  nor  fear  God.  He  laid  his  hands  upon 
such  as  be  at  peace  with  him,  and  he  brake  his  covenant.  The  words  of 
his  mouth  were  softer  than  butter,  having  war  in  his  heart ;  his  words  were 
smoother  than  oil,  and  yet  be  they  very  swords.  O  cast  thy  burden  upon 
the  Lord,  and  he  shall  nourish  thee,  and  shall  not  suffer  the  righteous  to 
fall  forever.  And  as  for  them,  thou,  O  God,  shalt  bring  them  into  the  pit 
of  destruction.  The  blood-thirsty  and  deceitful  men  shall  not  live  out 
half  their  days:  nevertheless,  my  trust  shall  be  in  thee,  O  Lord. 

Psalm  xci. 

Whoso  dwelleth  under  the  defence  of  the  Most  High,  shall  abide  under 
the  shadow  of  the  Almighty.  I  will  say  unto  the  Lord,  Thou  art  my 
hope,  and  my  strong  hold;  my  God,  in  him  will  I  trust.  For  he  shall  de- 
liver thee  from  the  snare  of  the  hunter,  and  from  the  noisome  pestilence. 
He  shall  defend  thee  under  his  wings,  and  thou  shalt  be  safe  under  his 
feathers;  his  faithfulness  and  truth  shall  be  thy  shield  and  buckler.  Thou 
shalt  not  be  afraid  for  any  terror  by  night,  nor  for  the  arrow  that  flieth 
by  day;  for  the  pestilence  that  walketh  in  darkness,  nor  for  the  sickness 
that  destroyeth  in  the  noon-day.  A  thousand  shall  fall  beside  thee,  and 
ten  thousand  at  thy  right  hand;  but  it  shall  not  come  nigh  thee.  Yea, 
with  thine  eyes  shalt  thou  behold,  and  see  the  reward  of  the  ungodly. 
For  thou,  Lord,  art  my  hope;  thou  hast  set  thine  house  of  defence  very 
high.  There  shall  no  evil  happen  unto  thee,  neither  shall  any  plague  come 
nigh  thy  dwelling.  For  he  shall  give  his  angels  charge  over  thee,  to  keep 
thee  in  all  thy  ways.  They  shall  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  that  thou  hurt 
not  thy  foot  against  a  stone.  Thou  shalt  go  upon  the  lion  and  adder:  the 
young  lion  and  the  dragon  shalt  thou  tread  under  thy  feet.  Because  he 
hath  set  his  love  upon  me,  therefore  will  I  deliver  him;  I  will  set  him  up, 
because  he  hath  known  my  Name.  He  shall  call  upon  me,  and  I  will 
hear  him;  yea,  I  am  with  him  in  trouble;  I  will  deliver  him,  and  bring  him 
to  honour.     With  long  life  will  I  satisfy  him,  and  show  him  my  salvation. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia;  glory  to  thee,  O  God.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.

50  THE  SIXTH  HOUR 

But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  we  recite  the  following  Hymn,  in  Tone  III.: 

O  thou  who,  on  the  sixth  day  and  Hour  didst  nail  to  the  Cross  the 
sin  which  Adam,  through  presumption,  committed  in  Paradise:  Tear 
asunder  also  the  handwriting  of  our  iniquities,  O  Christ-God,  and  save 
us. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1 :  Hear  my  prayer,  O  God,  and  hide  not  thyself  from 
my  petition. 

Verse  2 :  As  for  me,  I  will  call  upon  God,  and  the  Lord  shall  save  me. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 

Seeing  that  we  have  no  boldness,  because  of  the  multitude  of  our  sins, 
do  thou,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  fervently  entreat  Him  who  was  born 
of  thee:  for  the  prayer  of  a  Mother  availeth  much  to  the  good  will  of  the 
Lord.  Despise  not  the  supplications  of  sinners,  O  all-pure  One;  for 
merciful  and  mighty  to  save  is  He  who  graciously  deigned  to  suffer  for  us. 

With  thy  bounties  speedily  prevent  us,  O  Lord,  for  we  have  grievously 
sinned;  help  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  for  the  glory  of  thy  Name.  0  Lord, 
deliver  us,  and  purge  away  our  sins,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

0  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  in- 
firmities, for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)      Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever  .  .  . 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trepasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  of  the  Day  or  of  the  Tone* 
But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast,  we  say  these  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  II.: 
Thou  hast  wrought  salvation  in  the  midst  of  the  earth,  O  Christ- 
God.     Thou  didst  stretch  out  thine  all-pure  hands  upon  the  Cross; 
thou  hast  gathered  together  all  the  nations,  who  cry  aloud  unto  thee: 
Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.

THE  SIXTH  HOUR  51 

We  bow  down  in  reverence  before  thy  holy  Image,  O  Good  One, 
entreating  forgiveness  for  our  transgressions,  O  Christ-God;  for  of 
thine  own  good  will  thou  didst  graciously  deign  to  ascend  the  Cross  in 
the  flesh,  that  thou  mightest  deliver  from  the  works  of  the  enemy 
those  whom  thou  hadst  fashioned.  Wherefore  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee 
in  thanksgiving:  With  joy  thou  didst  fill  all  things,  O  our  Saviour, 
when  thou  didst  come  to  save  the  world. 

And  then  immediately,  on  Monday,  Tuesday  and  Thursday: 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 

Vouchsafe  unto  us  thy  mercy,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  thou  who  art  a 
Fount  of  tender  compassion.  Look  upon  the  people  who  have  sinned ; 
manifest,  as  always,  thy  power.  For  trusting  in  thee  we  cry  unto 
thee:  Hail!  as  did  aforetime  Gabriel,  Chief  of  the  Bodiless  Powers. 

On  Wednesday  and  Friday: 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Cross-Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Krestobogoroditchen). 

Exceedingly  blessed  art  thou,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  we 
sing  thy  praise :  for  by  the  Cross  of  thy  Son  was  Hell  overthrown  and 
Death  was  slain;  and  we  who  were  dead  have  risen  again,  and  have 
mercifully  been  deemed  worthy  of  life,  and  have  received  Paradise, 
which  was  our  delight  of  old.  For  which  cause,  with  thanksgiving  we 
magnify  Christ  our  God,  in  that  he  is  mighty  and  in  that  he  alone 
loveth  mankind. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Forty  times.) 

Thou  who,  at  all  times  and  at  every  hour,  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth, 
art  worshipped  and  glorified,  O  Christ  our  God,  long-suffering,  plenteous 
in  mercy  and  compassion;  who  lovest  the  just  and  showest  mercy  to  those 
who  are  hardened  in  sin ;  who  callest  all  men  to  salvation  through  the 
promise  of  good  things  to  come:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  receive  also  our 
supplications  at  this  present  time,  and  direct  our  lives  according  to  thy 
commandments.  Sanctify  our  souls;  purify  our  bodies;  set  aright  our 
minds;  cleanse  our  thoughts;  and  deliver  us  from  all  calamity,  wrath,  and 
distress.  Compass  us  round  about  with  thy  holy  Angels;  that,  guided 
and  guarded  by  their  host,  we  may  attain  unto  the  unity  of  the  faith,  and 
unto  the  comprehension  of  thine  ineffable  glory.  For  blessed  art  thou 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy      (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more 
glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 


S 


52  THE  SIXTH  HOUR 

In  the  Name  of  the  Lord  bless,  Father. 

Priest.  Through  the  prayers  of  our  holy  Fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

And  if  it  be  a  Fast,  we  make  three  great  reverences  to  the  very  earth  and  say  the 
prescribed 

Prayer  of  St.  Ephraim  the  Syrian. 

O  Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  grant  not  unto  me  a  spirit  of  sloth- 
fulness,  of  discouragement,  of  lust  of  power,  of  vain  babbling.  (Rever- 
ence.) 

But  vouchsafe  unto  me,  thy  servant  the  spirit  of  continence,  of 
meekness,  of  patience,  and  of  love.     (Reverence.) 

Yea,  O  Lord  and  King,  grant  that  I  may  perceive  my  own  trans- 
gressions, and  judge  not  my  brother.  For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages 
of  ages.  Amen.  (Reverence.  Then  twelve  lesser  reverences,  saying  at 
each:  O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner.  Then  the  whole  Prayer  is  re- 
peated; with  one  great  reverence  in  conclusion.) 

Then  this  Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

O  God  and  Lord  of  hosts,  and  Maker  of  all  things  created,  who  through 
the  tender-hearted  compassion  of  thine  incomparable  mercy  didst  send 
down  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  for  the  redemption 
of  our  race,  and  by  his  precious  Cross  didst  destroy  the  handwriting  of 
our  sins,  and  didst  thereby  triumph  over  the  Origin  and  Powers  of  dark- 
ness: Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  who  lovest  mankind,  accept  also  these 
thanksgivings  and  fervent  prayers  of  us  sinners.  And  deliver  us  from 
every  harmful  and  gloomy  transgression,  and  from  all  enemies,  both  visi- 
ble and  invisible,  who  seek  after  us  to  destroy  us.  Nail  our  flesh  to  the 
fear  of  thee,  and  incline  not  our  hearts  to  words  or  thoughts  of  guile:  but 
wound  our  souls  with  the  love  of  thee;  that  looking  ever  unto  thee,  and 
guided  by  thee  in  the  light,  beholding  thee,  the  Light  Ineffable  and  Ever- 
lasting, we  may  ascribe  unto  thee  ceaseless  praise  and  thanksgiving:  unto 
the  Father  who  hath  no  beginning,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Generally  the  Divine  Liturgy  beginneth  here.  But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  (Lent), 
after  this  is  read  the  Ninth  Hour;  and  the  Ninth  Hour,  when  itfolloweth  the 
Sixth  Hour,  beginneth  thus: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     (Thrice.)     Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever  .  .  . 
O  all-holy  Trinity,  .  .  . 


THE  NINTH  HOUR  53 


THE  NINTH  HOUR* 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

And  We.     Amen. 

Glory  to  thee,  O  our  God;  glory  to  thee. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places, 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come,  and 
take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save  our 
souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

0  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ;  But  deliver  us  from 
the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Reader.  Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Twelve  times.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  (Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  lxxxiv. 

O  how  amiable  are  thy  dwellings,  thou  Lord  of  hosts!  My  soul  hath  a 
desire  and  longing  to  enter  into  the  courts  of  the  Lord ;  my  heart  and  my 
flesh  rejoice  in  the  living  God.  Yea,  the  sparrow  hath  found  her  an  house, 
and  the  swallow  a  nest,  where  she  may  lay  her  young;  even  thy  altars, 

*  See  Appendix  B,  III. 


54  THE  NINTH  HOUR 

0  Lord  of  hosts,  my  King  and  my  God.  Blessed  are  they  that  dwell  in 
thy  house;  they  will  be  alway  praising  thee.  Blessed  is  the  man  whose 
strength  is  in  thee ;  in  whose  heart  are  thy  ways.  Who  going  through  the 
vale  of  misery  use  it  for  a  well ;  and  the  pools  are  filled  with  water.  They 
will  go  from  strength  to  strength,  and  unto  the  God  of  gods  appeareth 
every  one  of  them  in  Sion.  O  Lord  God  of  hosts,  hear  my  prayer; 
hearken,  O  God  of  Jacob.  Behold,  O  God  our  defender,  and  look  upon 
the  face  of  thine  Anointed.  For  one  day  in  thy  courts  is  better  than  a 
thousand.  I  had  rather  be  a  door-keeper  in  the  house  of  my  God,  than  to 
dwell  in  the  tents  of  ungodliness.  For  the  Lord  God  is  a  light  and  defence; 
the  Lord  will  give  grace  and  worship;  and  no  good  thing  shall  he  withhold 
from  them  that  live  a  godly  life.  O  Lord  God  of  hosts,  blessed  is  the  man 
that  putteth  his  trust  in  thee. 

Psalm  lxxxv. 

Lord,  thou  art  become  gracious  unto  thy  land;  thou  hast  turned  away 
the  captivity  of  Jacob.  Thou  hast  forgiven  the  offence  of  thy  people,  and 
covered  all  their  sins.  Thou  hast  taken  away  all  thy  displeasure,  and 
turned  thyself  from  thy  wrathful  indignation.  Turn  us  then,  O  God  our 
Saviour,  and  let  thine  anger  cease  from  us.  Wilt  thou  be  displeased  at 
us  for  ever?  and  wilt  thou  stretch  out  thy  wrath  from  one  generation  to 
another?  Wilt  thou^not  turn  again  and  quicken  us,  that  thy  people  may 
rejoice  in  thee?     Show  us  thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  and  grant  us  thy  salvation. 

1  will  hearken  what  the  Lord  God  will  say  concerning  me;  for  he  shall 
speak  peace  unto  his  people,  and  to  his  saints,  that  they  turn  not  again. 
For  his  salvation  is  nigh  them  that  fear  him;  that  glory  may  dwell  in  our 
land.  Mercy  and  truth  are  met  together;  righteousness  and  peace  have 
kissed  each  other.  Truth  shall  flourish  out  of  the  earth,  and  righteous- 
ness hath  looked  down  from  heaven.  Yea,  the  Lord  shall  show  loving- 
kindness;  and  our  land  shall  give  her  increase.  Righteousness  shall  go 
before  him;  and  he  shall  direct  his  going  in  the  way. 

Psalm  lxxxvi. 
Bow  down  thine  ear,  O  Lord,  and  hear  me;  for  I  am  poor,  and  in  misery. 
Preserve  thou  my  soul,  for  I  am  holy:  my  God,  save  thy  servant  that 
putteth  his  trust  in  thee.  Be  merciful  unto  me,  O  Lord;  for  I  will  call 
daily  upon  thee.  Comfort  the  soul  of  thy  servant;  for  unto  thee,  O  Lord, 
do  I  lift  up  my  soul.  For  thou,  Lord,  art  good  and  gracious,  and  of  great 
mercy  unto  all  them  that  call  upon  thee.  Give  ear,  Lord,  unto  my 
prayer,  and  ponder  the  voice  of  my  humble  desires.  In  the  time  of  my 
trouble  I  will  call  upon  thee;  for  thou  hearest  me.  Among  the  gods  there 
is  none  like  unto  thee,  O  Lord;  there  is  not  one  that  can  do  as  thou  doest. 
All  nations  whom  thou  hast  made  shall  come  and  worship  thee,  O  Lord; 
and  shall  glorify  thy  Name.  For  thou  art  great  and  doest  wondrous 
things;  thou  art  God  alone.     Teach  me  thy  way,  O  Lord,  and  I  will  walk 


THE  NINTH  HOUR  55 

in  thy  truth:  O  knit  my  heart  unto  thee,  that  I  may  fear  thy  Name.  I 
will  thank  thee,  O  Lord  my  God,  with  all  my  heart;  and  will  praise  thy 
Name  for  evermore.  For  great  is  thy  mercy  toward  me;  and  thou  hast 
delivered  my  soul  from  the  nethermost  hell.  O  God,  the  proud  are  risen 
against  me :  and  the  congregations  of  naughty  men  have  sought  after  my 
soul,  and  have  not  set  thee  before  their  eyes.  But  thou,  O  Lord  God,  art 
full  of  compassion  and  mercy,  long-suffering,  plenteous  in  goodness  and 
truth.  O  turn  thee  then  unto  me,  and  have  mercy  upon  me:  give  thy 
strength  unto  thy  servant,  and  help  the  son  of  thine  handmaid.  Show 
some  token  upon  me  for  good ;  that  they  who  hate  me  may  see  it,  and  be 
ashamed,  because  thou,  Lord,  hast  holpen  me,  and  comforted  me.  And 
again:  Show  some  token  upon  me  for  good;  that  they  who  hate  me  may 
see  it,  and  be  ashamed,  because  thou,  Lord,  hast  holpen  me,  and  com- 
forted me. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia;  glory  to  thee,  O  God.     (Thrice.) 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  .     .  now,  and  ever. 

And  we  read  the  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr).* 
But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  this  Hymn,  in  Tone  VIII.,  is  used: 

O  thou  who,  at  the  Ninth  Hour,  for  our  sake  didst  taste  of  death 
in  the  flesh:  Mortify  thou  the  presumption  of  our  flesh,  and  save  us, 
0  Christ-God. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1 :  Let  my  complaint  come  before  thee,  O  Lord :  give 
me  understanding,  according  to  thy  word. 

Verse  2 :  Let  my  supplication  come  before  thee,  O  Lord :  deliver  me 
according  to  thy  word. 

Glory  .  .     now,  and  ever.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Thou  who  for  our  sake  wast  born  of  a  Virgin,  and  didst  suffer  cruci- 
fixion, O  Good  One,  and  didst  despoil  Death  through  death,  and  as  God 
didst  reveal  Resurrection:  Despise  not  those  whom  thou  hast  created 
with  thine  own  hand;  show  forth  thy  love  for  mankind,  O  Merciful  One; 
accept  the  Birth-giver  of  God  who  bare  thee,  and  who  entreateth  thee  for 
us;  and  save  thy  despairing  people,  O  our  Saviour. 

Forsake  us  not  utterly,  for  thy  Name's  sake,  and  destroy  not  thy  cov- 
enant; and  take  not  thy  mercies  from  us,  for  the  sake  of  Abraham  whom 
thou  lovedst,  and  for  the  sake  of  Isaac  thy  servant,  and  of  Israel,  thy 
Holy  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  (as  at  the  beginning  of  the  Hour) 
Glory         now,  and  ever       .  O  all-holy  Trinity,       .  Lord,  have  mercy.

heaven,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy       .  Glory       .  now,  and  ever  .  .  . 
And  if  it  be  a  Feast,  we  say  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  thereof* 
But  if  not,  these  Hymns  in  Tone  VIII.: 

When  the  thief  beheld  the  Author  of  life  hanging  upon  the  Cross,  he 
said :  If  thou  wert  not  God  incarnate,  who  art  here  crucified  with  us,  then 
had  the  Sun  not  veiled  its  rays,  neither  would  the  earth  have  shaken  with 
trembling.  But  do  thou,  who  sufferest  for  all  men,  remember  me,  O 
Lord,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

In  the  midst,  between  two  thieves,  was  thy  Cross  found  the  balance- 
beam  of  righteousness;  for  while  the  one  was  led  down  to  hell  by  the 
burden  of  his  blaspheming,  the  other  was  lightened  of  his  sins,  unto  the 
knowledge  of  things  divine.     O  Christ-God,  glory  to  thee. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

When  she  who  bare  thee  beheld  upon  the  Cross  thee,  the  Lamb,  and 
Shepherd,  and  Saviour  of  the  world,  she  weeping  said:  The  world  re- 
joiceth,  in  that  it  hath  received  redemption,  but  my  heart  kindleth  with 
yearning  as  I  look  upon  thy  crucifixion,  which  thou  sufferest  for  all  men, 
O  my  Son  and  my  God. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Forty  times.) 

Thou  who,  at  all  times  and  at  every  hour,  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth 
art  worshipped  and  glorified,  O  Christ-God,  long-suffering,  plenteous  in 
mercy  and  compassion;  who  lovest  the  just  and  showest  mercy  to  those 
who  are  hardened  in  sin;  who  callest  all  men  to  salvation  through  the 
promise  of  good  things  to  come:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  receive  also  our 
supplications  at  this  present  time,  and  direct  our  lives  according  to  thy 
commandments.  Sanctify  our  souls;  purify  our  bodies;  set  aright  our 
minds;  cleanse  our  thoughts;  and  deliver  us  from  all  calamity,  wrath  and 
distress.  Compass  us  round  about  with  thy  holy  Angels;  that,  guided 
and  guarded  by  their  host,  we  may  attain  unto  the  unity  of  the  faith,  and 
unto  the  comprehension  of  thine  ineffable  glory.  For  blessed  art  thou 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glo- 
rious than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

In  the  name  of  the  Lord  bless,  Father. 

Priest.  God  be  merciful  unto  us,  and  bless  us,  and  show  us  the  light  of 
his  countenance,  and  be  merciful  unto  us.

THE  NINTH  HOUR  57 

Then  the  INTERHOUR. 

In  the  holy  Great  Fast  (Lent),  three  great  reverences  shall  be  made,  and  the  Prayer  of 
St.  Ephraim  shall  be  recited  once.     (See  page  52.) 

But  otherwise,  after  the  Exclamation,  God  be  merciful  unto  us,  there  shall  be  said  this 
Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

0  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  art  long-suffering  toward 
our  sins,  and  who  hast  led  us  even  to  the  present  hour,  in  the  which,  as 
thou  didst  hang  upon  the  life-giving  Tree  thou  didst  make  a  way  into 
Paradise  for  the  penitent  thief,  and  by  death  didst  destroy  Death :  Cleanse 
us  sinners  and  thine  unworthy  servants;  for  we  have  sinned  and  have 
dealt  iniquitously,  and  we  are  not  worthy  to  lift  up  our  eyes  and  look  upon 
the  heights  of  heaven,  inasmuch  as  we  have  departed  from  the  path  of  thy 
righteousness,  and  have  walked  after  the  desires  of  our  own  hearts.  But 
we  implore  of  thy  boundless  goodness:  Spare  us,  O  Lord,  according  to  the 
multitude  of  thy  mercies,  and  save  us,  for  thy  holy  Name's  sake;  for  our 
days  have  passed  away  in  vanity.  Wrest  us  out  of  the  hand  of  the  ad- 
versary, and  forgive  our  sins,  and  mortify  in  us  carnal  imagination;  that 
putting  off  the  old  man  we  may  be  clothed  upon  with  the  new  man,  and 
may  live  unto  thee,  our  Master  and  our  Benefactor;  and  that  so  following 
after  thy  commandments,  we  may  attain  unto  rest  eternal,  where  is  the 
abode  of  all  those  who  rejoice.  For  thou  art,  in  verity,  the  true  joy  and 
exultation  of  those  who  love  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  and  unto  thee  we  as- 
cribe glory,  together  with  the  Father,  who  is  without  beginning,  and  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.    Amen. 

When  the  Ninth  Hour  is  read  separately  from  the  Typical  Psalms: 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)     Bless. 

Then  the  Benediction. 
Priest.  May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  holy 
Mother  (of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles);  of  Saint  N.  (the 
Saint  of  the  day) ;  of  Saint  N.  (the  Saint  of  the  Church) ;  and  of  all  the  Saints, 
have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us :  forasmuch  as  he  is  gracious  and  loveth 
mankind. 

But  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  then  the  Typical  Psalms  immediately  follow,  and 
Psalms  ciii.  and  cxvi.  are  omitted. 


THE  TYPICAL  PSALMS  * 

The  beginning  of  the  Typical  Psalms  shall  be  said  thus: 

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul:  blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord. 

Psalm  ciii. 

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul ;  and  all  that  is  within  me,  bless  his  holy  name. 
Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul,  and  forget  not  all  his  benefits:  who  forgiveth 
all  thine  iniquities,  and  healeth  all  thy  diseases;  who  redeemeth  thy  life 
from  destruction;  who  crowneth  thee  with  loving- kindness  and  tender 
mercies;  who  satisfieth  thy  mouth  with  good  things;  so  that  thy  youth  is 
renewed  like  the  eagle's.  The  Lord  executeth  righteousness  and  judg- 
ment for  all  that  are  oppressed.  He  made  known  his  ways  unto  Moses, 
his  acts  unto  the  children  of  Israel.  The  Lord  is  merciful  and  gracious, 
slow(to  anger,  and  plenteous  in  mercy.  He  will  not  always  chide;  neither 
will  he  keep  his  anger  forever.  He  hath  not  dealt  with  us  after  our  sins, 
nor  rewarded  us  according  to  our  iniquities.  For  as  the  heaven  is  high 
above  the  earth,  so  great  is  his  mercy  toward  them  that  fear  him.  As  far 
as  the  east  is  from  the  west,  so  far  hath  he  removed  our  transgressions 
from  us.  Like  as  a  father  pitieth  his  children,  so  the  Lord  pitieth  them 
that  fear  him.  For  he  knoweth  our  frame;  he  remembereth  that  we  are 
dust.  As  for  man,  his  days  are  as  grass;  as  a  flower  of  the  field,  so  he 
flourisheth.  For  the  wind  passeth  over  it,  and  it  is  gone;  and  the  place 
thereof  shall  know  it  no  more.  But  the  mercy  of  the  Lord  is  from  ever- 
lasting to  everlasting,  upon  them  that  fear  him,  and  his  righteousness 
unto  children's  children;  to  such  as  keep  his  covenant,  and  to  those  that 
remember  his  commandments  to  do  them.  The  Lord  hath  prepared  his 
throne  in  the  heavens;  and  his  kingdom  ruleth  over  all.  Bless  the  Lord, 
ye  his  angels,  that  excel  in  strength,  that  do  his  commandments,  hearken- 
ing unto  the  voice  of  his  word.  Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  hosts;  ye  minis- 
ters of  his  that  do  his  pleasure.  Bless  the  Lord  all  works  of  his,  in  all 
places  of  his  dominion:  bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit:  The  first 
Choir,  with  heightened  voices.  Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages:  The 
second  Choir. 

The  First  Choir. 
Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul,  and  all  that  is  within  me,  bless  his  holy 
name.     Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

*  See  Appendix  B,  III. 


THE  TYPICAL  PSALMS  59 

Psalm  cxlvi. 

Praise  the  Lord,  O  my  soul.  While  I  live  will  I  praise  the  Lord:  I  will 
sing  praises  unto  my  God  while  I  have  any  being.  Put  not  your  trust  in 
princes,  nor  in  the  son  of  man,  in  whom  there  is  no  help.  His  breath  goeth 
forth,  he  returneth  to  his  earth;  in  that  very  day  his  thoughts  perish. 
Happy  is  he  that  hath  the  God  of  Jacob  for  his  help,  whose  hope  is  in  the 
Lord  his  God:  which  made  heaven  and  earth,  the  sea,  and  all  that  therein 
is;  which  keepeth  truth  forever:  which  executeth  judgment  for  the  op- 
pressed :  which  giveth  food  to  the  hungry  The  Lord  looseth  the  prison- 
ers: the  Lord  openeth  the  eyes  of  the  blind:  the  Lord  raiseth  them  that 
are  bowed  down :  the  Lord  loveth  the  righteous :  the  Lord  preserveth  the 
strangers;  he  relieveth  the  fatherless  and  widow:  but  the  way  of  the 
wicked  he  turneth  upside  down.  The  Lord  shall  reign  forever,  even  thy 
God,  O  Zion,  unto  all  generations. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Only-begotten  Son,  and  Word  of  God!  Thou  who  art  immortal  yet 
didst  deign  for  our  salvation  to  become  incarnate  of  the  Holy  Birth-giver 
of  God  and  ever- virgin  Mary:  and  without  change  of  essence  wast  made 
man;  who  also  wast  crucified  for  us,  O  Christ-God,  trampling  down  Death 
by  death ;  who  art  one  of  the  Holy  Trinity  and  art  glorified  together  with 
the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit:  Save  us. 

In  the  Great  Fast,  after  the  Ninth  Hour,  and  the  Prayer,  O  Master,  Lord  Jesus 
Christ  our  God  (page  57),  we  sing,  in  Tone  VIII.: 

The  Beatitudes. 
In  thy  kingdom  remember  us,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  king- 
dom. 

Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit:  for  theirs  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

And  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast,  to  every  verse  is  added  the  Refrain:  Remember  us,  O  Lord, 
when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  they  that  mourn:  for  they  shall  be  comforted,   fy 
Blessed  are  the  meek:  for  they  shall  inherit  the  earth,    fy 
Blessed  are  they  that  do  hunger  and  thirst  after  righteousness: 

for  they  shall  be  filled.    Ц 

Blessed  are  the  merciful:  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy,    fy 
Blessed  are  the  pure  in  heart:  for  they  shall  see  God.    1$ 
Blessed  are  the  peacemakers:  for  they  shall  be  called  the  children 

of  God.    1$ 

Blessed  are  they  which  are  persecuted  for  righteousness'  sake:  for 

theirs  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven.    1^ 

Blessed  are  ye  when  men  shall  revile  you,  and  persecute  you,  and 

shall  say  all  manner  of  evil  against  you  falsely,  for  my  sake.    1$ 
Rejoice,  and  be  exceeding  glad,   for  great  is  your  reward  in 

heaven,   fy

Remember  us,  O  Master,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Remember  us,  O  Holy  One,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 
(And  one  reverence  at  each.) 

The  heavenly  choir  doth  hymn  thee,  and  doth  cry,  Holy,  holy,  holy, 
Lord  God  of  Hosts:  heaven  and  earth  are  full  of  thy  glory. 

Verse:  Come  unto  him  and  be  enlightened,  and  your  faces  shall  not  be

and  earth  are  full  of  thy  glory. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible. 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  only-begotten  Son  of  God,  Begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God,  Be- 
gotten, not  made;  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom  all 
things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came  down 
from  heaven,  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin  Mary, 
And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius  Pilate, 
and  suffered  and  was  buried.  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again,  according 
to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father,  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both  the 
quick  and  the  dead ;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end. 

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord  and  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth 
from  the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and 
Apostolic  Church.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission  of  sins. 
I  look  for  the  Resurrection  of  the  dead,  And  the  Life  of  the  world  to  come. 
Amen. 

Loose,  remit,  pardon,  O  God,  our  transgressions,  voluntary  and  invol- 
untary ;  whether  of  word  or  of  deed ;  whether  of  knowledge  or  of  ignorance; 
whether  of  the  day  or  of  the  night;  whether  of  the  mind,  or  of  the  inten- 
tion: Forgive  us  all,  for  thou  art  good  and  lovest  mankind. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One:

ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

If  it  be  Saturday: 

Unto  thee,  O  Lord,  the  Author  of  Creation,  the  universe  doth  offer  the 
God-bearing  Martyrs  as  the  first-fruits  of  nature:  By  whose  prayers, 
through  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  do  thou  preserve  in  peace  profound  thy 
Church,  which  is  thine  estate,  O  most  merciful  One. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  of  the  Transfiguration. 
Thou  wast  transfigured  on  the  Mount,  and  in  so  far  as  they  were  able 
to  receive  it,  thy  disciples,  with  wonder,  beheld  thy  glory,  O  Christ-God. 
And  when  they  beheld  thee  crucified,  they  understood  thy  voluntary 
Passion,  and  proclaimed  unto  the  world  that  thou  art,  of  a  truth,  the 
Radiance  of  the  Father. 

Collect-Hymns  for: 
Monday:  Hymn  of  the  Bodiless  Powers,  Tone  II.: 
O  ye  Chieftains  of  God,  servitors  of  the  divine  glory,  Captains  of  the 
Angels  and  Guides  of  men :  Entreat  that  which  is  profitable  for  us,  and 
great  mercy ;  in  that  ye  are  the  Chieftains  of  the  Bodiless  Powers. 

Tuesday:  Hymn  of  the  Forerunner,  Tone  II.: 
O  Prophet  of  God,  and  Forerunner  of  Grace,  in  that  we  have  found  thy 
holy  head  as  a  most  sacred  rose  budding  forth  from  the  earth,  we  receive 
always  thy  healing.     For  still,  as  aforetime  in  the  world,  thou  dost  preach 
repentance. 

Wednesday  and  Friday:  Tone  III.: 
Do  thou  who,  of  thine  own  good  will,  upon  the  cross  wast  lifted  up, 
bestow  thy  bounties  upon  the  new  State  which  is  called  by  thy  Name, 
O  Christ-God;  make  glad  with  thy  might  our  God-fearing  Ruler,  grant- 
ing victory  over  his  adversaries  unto  him  who  hath  thine  aid,  which  is 
a  panoply  of  peace,  a  trophy  invincible. 

Thursday:  the  Holy  Apostles,  Tone  II.: 
Thou  hast  received  thy  steadfast  Preachers,  God-inspired  in  speech, 
the  Crown  of  thy  Disciples,  O  Lord,  into  the  delights  and  the  repose  of  thy 
blessed  ones;  for  thou  hast  accepted  their  sufferings  and  their  death  as 
greater  than  any  whole  burnt-offerings,  O  thou  who  alone  knowest  the 
secrets  of  the  heart. 

The  same  day:  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  of  St.  Nicholas,  Tone  III.: 
In  Myra,  O  Saint,  wast  thou  shown  forth  a  sacrificing  priest;  for  fulfill- 
ing the  Gospel  of  Christ,  O  Holy  One,  thou  didst  lay  down  thy  life  for  thy 
people,  and  didst  save  the  innocent  from  death.     For  which  cause  thou

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

To  the  souls  of  thy  servants,  O  Lord,  give  rest  with  thy  Saints,  where 
there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  everlasting. 

Then  immediately,  on  every  day  except  Saturday,  is  said: 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Protection  of  Christians  that  maketh  not  ashamed,  O  Mediatrix 
never- failing  with  the  Creator:  Despise  not  the  sinners'  voice  of  supplica- 
tion; but  in  that  thou  art  good,  come  speedily  to  the  aid  of  us  who  faith- 
fully call  upon  thee;  make  haste  to  our  petition  and  further  our  prayer, 
O  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  ever  protectest  them  that  do  thee  honour. 

And  if  it  be  the  Great  Fast:

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glori-

Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

In  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  bless,  Father. 

Priest.  God  be  merciful  to  us,  and  bless  us,  and  show  us  the  light  of  his 
countenance,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

Then  the  Prayer  of  St.  Ephraim  the  Syrian. 

O  Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  grant  not  unto  me  a  spirit  of  slothfulness, 
of  discouragement,  of  lust  of  power,  of  vain  babbling.  {A  great  reverence 
to  the  earth.) 

But  vouchsafe  unto  me,  thy  servant  the  spirit  of  continence,  of  meek- 
ness, of  patience,  and  of  love.     {Reverence.) 

Yea,  O  Lord  and  King,  grant  that  I  may  perceive  my  own  transgres-

Amen.  {Reverence.  Then  twelve  lesser  reverences,  saying  at  each  reverence: 
O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner.  Then  the  whole  prayer  is  repeated,  with

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

PREFATORY  NOTE  AND  DIRECTIONS 

The  word  Liturgy,  which  in  the  Greek  means  "A  public  work"  or  "Ministry,"  is 
particularly  applied  (heightened  by  the  adjective  "Divine")  to  the  chief  service  of 
the  day,  in  which  the  Holy  Eucharist,  or  Service  of  Thanksgiving,  is  celebrated. 

Three  Liturgies  are  used  in  the  Holy  Orthodox  Catholic  Apostolic  Church  of  the 
East: 

That  of  St.  John  Chrysostom;  that  of  St.  Basil  the  Great;  and  that  of  the  Pre- 
sanctified Gifts. 

The  Divine  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  and  that  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  are 
divided  into  three  parts.  In  the  first  part,  the  clergy  prepare  the  bread  and  wine, 
and  it  is  called  The  Office  of  Oblation.  The  second  part  consists  of  prayers,  reading 
and  singing,  with  which  the  faithful  prepare  themselves  for  the  Holy  Sacrament,  and 
at  which  alone  Catechumens  (or  learners)  were  allowed,  in  former  times,  to  be  pres- 
ent :  it  is  called  The  Liturgy  of  the  Catechumens.  The  third  part,  called  The  Liturgy 
of. the  Faithful,  is  the  celebration  of  the  Sacrament  of  the  Holy  Eucharist;  and  in  the 
early  Church  only  the  Faithful  —  that  is  to  say,  members  of  the  Christian  Church 
—  were  permitted  to  be  present  at  it. 

The  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  differs  from  that  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  only 
in  certain  of  the  Secret  Prayers,  one  Hymn,  and  three  phrases  in  the  Consecration  of 
the  Holy  Gifts  (as  duly  indicated  at  the  proper  places),  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John 
Chrysostom  being  a  later  and  abbreviated  form  of  St.  Basil's  Liturgy,  as  the  latter, 
in  turn,  was  a  later  and  abbreviated  form  of  a  still  earlier  Liturgy 

It  is  appointed  to  be  used  on  the  Sundays  of  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  except  on 
Palm  Sunday;  on  Holy  Thursday  and  Holy  Saturday;  and  on  Christmas  Day  and 
the  Epiphany,  when  those  feasts  fall  upon  Sunday  or  Monday;  otherwise,  on  the 
days  preceding  those  feasts.  Also,  on  St.  Basil's  Day,  January  i ;  in  all,  ten  times  in 
the  course  of  the  year. 

The  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts,  so  called  because  the  Holy  Gifts  which 
have  previously  been  consecrated  are  used  for  the  Holy  Communion,  has  existed 
from  ancient  times,  although,  in  its  present  form,  it  is  ascribed  to  St.  Gregory  Hom- 
iliastes  of  Rome  (sixth  century).  The  Orthodox  Church  decrees  that  this  Liturgy 
shall  be  celebrated  during  the  Great  Fast  (but  at  no  other  time),  since  the  trium- 
phantly joyous  feelings  associated  with  the  complete  Liturgy  and  the  consecration 
of  the  Holy  Gifts  are  incompatible  with  the  strictness  of  the  Fast.  Hence  it  is 
ordainedthat  the  complete  Liturgy  shall  be  celebrated  only  on  Saturdays  and  Sun- 
days during  the  weeks  of  the  Great  Fast  (Lent).  The  customary  days  for  the  cele- 
bration of  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  are  Wednesday  and  Friday  of  every 
week,  and  on  Monday,  Tuesday  and  Wednesday  of  Passion^Week. 

The  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  consists  of  Vespers  (and  therefore  is  ap- 
pointed for  a  late  hour  in  the  day),  and  of  a  portion  of  the  ordinary  Liturgy,  omitting 
the  most  essential  part  of  the  latter,  namely,  the  consecration  of  the  Gifts.  The 
Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  is  usually  preceded  by  the  reading  of  the  Third, 
Sixth  and  Ninth  Hours,  and  of  the  Typical  Psalms.  Under  certain  circumstances 
an  earlier  celebration  is  admissible. 

The  usual  hour  for  celebrating  the  ordinary  Liturgy  is,  not  earlier  than  dawn  and 
not  later  than  noon.  ' 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  65 

For  the  celebration  of  the  Mystery  of  the  Eucharist  the  following  are  indispensa- 
ble: A  Priest  or  a  Bishop  regularly  ordained,  and  having  a  steadtast  will  and  inten- 
tion to  fulfil  the  Mystery  of  the  Lord's  Body  and  Blood.  Of  material  things:  five 
Altar-breads,  made  of  pure  wheaten  flour,  and  leavened ;  wine  of  the  grape.  The 
accomplishment  of  the  Mystery  through  prayer  and  words,  with  the  blessing  of  the 
Priest's  hand:  "And  make  this  bread  the  precious  Body  of  thy  Christ,  and  also  that 
which  is  in  this  cup  the  precious  Blood  of  thy  Christ,  transmuting  them  bv  thy  Holy 
Spirit." 

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  following  things  are  indispensable  for  the  Liturgy:  A 
Corporal  (Antimins),*  consecrated  by  a  Bishop;  vestments  for  the  Priest,  consisting 
of  a  cassock  (stikhdr),  a  stole  (epitrakhil) ,  gauntlets  (porutchi),  girdle  (poyas),  and 
chasuble  (felon) ;  vessels,  —  a  chalice,  a  paten,  a  star-cover,  a  spear,  a  spoon;  veils,  a 
censer,  a  service  book;  lights  burning  on  the  altar;  and  an  acolyte. 

Only  one  Liturgy  may  be  celebrated  on  any  Altar  in  the  course  of  one  day;  and  no 
Bishop  or  Priest  may  celebrate  more  than  one  Liturgy  in  the  course  of  one  and  the 
same  day. 

The  Priest  who  enters  upon  the  celebration  of  the  Liturgy  must  be  free  from  in- 
hibition, and  from  mortal  sin,  and  must  prepare  himself,  —  spiritually,  by  reconcil- 
ing himself  with  all  men,  by  penitence,  and  the  appointed  devotions;  bodily,  by 
abstinence  from  food  and  drink  (from  midnight  at  the  least),  and  from  fleshly  de- 
sires, and  by  cleanliness  of  body  and  garments. 

The  appointed  devotions  consist  of  the  celebration  or  the  hearing  of  the  Evening 
and  Morning  Services  and  Prayers;  and  there  must  also  be  read:  On  Monday:  Tbe 
Canon  to  the  Lord  Jesus,  the  Invocation  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  the  Canon  to  the 
Archangels;  and,  if  he  so  desire,  to  his  Guardian  Angel.  On  Tuesday:  The  Canon  to 
the  Lord  Jesus,  the  Invocation  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  to  John  the  Forerunner, 
and  to  his  Guardian  Angel.  On  Wednesday:  The  Canon  to  the  Lord  Jesus,  the 
Canon  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  to  his  Guardian  Angel.  On  Thursday:  The 
Canon  to  the  Lord  Jesus,  the  Invocation  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  to  his  Guardian 
Angel,  to  the  Holy  Apostles;  and,  if  he  so  desire,  to  St.  Nicholas.  On  Friday,  the 
Canon  to  the  Life-giving  Cross,  the  Invocation  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  to  his 
Guardian  Angel.  On  Saturday:  The  Canon  to  the  Lord  Jesus,  the  Chant  of  Prayer 
and  Praise  (Akdfist)  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  to  his  Guardian  Angel,  and  to  all  the 
Saints.  On  Sunday:  The  Canon  to  the  Lord  Jesus,  the  Invocation  to  the  Birth- 
giver  of  God,  and  to  his  Guardian  Angel. 

In  addition  to  these,  on  every  occasion,  the  Canon  of  the  Communion,  and  the 
Prayers  before  the  Communion.     (See  Index.) 

The  Curtain  and  the  Holy  Door.  At  Divine  Service  the  curtain  is  drawn  aside 
before  the  beginning  of  the  Liturgy,  when  the  benediction  is  given  at  the  end  of  the  Obla- 
tion. The  Holy  Door  is  opened  before  the  Lesser  Entrance,  and  closed  before  the  Litany 
of  the  Catechumens.  It  is  opened  again  before  the  Cherubimic  Hymn,  and  closed  after 
the  Great  Entrance,  at  which  time  the  curtain  also  is  drawn.  The  curtain  is  drawn  aside 
at  the  words:  The  Doors !  The  Doors !  It  is  drawn  again  at  the  Exclamation:  Holy 
Things  to  the  Holy.  The  curtain  is  drawn  aside  and  the  Holy  Door  is  opened  before: 
In  the  fear  of  God     .  . ;  and  is  finally  closed  after  the  Dismissal. 

At  a  Pontifical  Service  :  The  Holy  Door  is  opened  at  the  beginning  of  the  service, 
and  so  remains  until  the  Exclamation:  Let  us  attend!  Holy  Things  to  the  Holy. 
After  that  it  is  opened  and  closed  as  usual. 

The  Bishop's  Pall  and  Mitre.  At  a  Pontifical  Service,  the  pall  (omofor)  is  re- 
moved before  the  Epistle;  is  put  on  while  the  particles  are  being  taken  from  the  sacred 
breads  before  the  Great  Entrance,  and  is  immediately  laid  aside  again.  After  the  prayer: 
With  them  also  .  .  .  {and  the  Hymn:  Holy,  holy,  holy  .),  it  is  put  on;  and  it  is  re- 
moved when  the  Holy  Spirit  is  invoked.     At  the  Exclamation:  Let  us  attend!     Holy

things  to  the  holy:  it  is  put  on,  and  is  then  worn  until  the  Dismissal.  In  addition  to 
the  above,  the  Bishop  puts  on  his  pall  when  he  ordains  a  Deacon  or  a  Priest. 

The  Mitre  is  removed  while  the  particles  are  being  taken  from  the  holy  breads,  and  at 
the  Commemoration  of  Persons  at  the  Great  Entrance;  while:  Let  us  love  one  another 

. :  is  being  said,  and  while  the  Creed  is  being  chanted;  also,  from:  Take,  eat  .  .  . ;  and 
until:  More  especially  for  the  Most  Holy  {and  during  the  reception  of  the  Holy 
Communion  by  the  Bishop). 


THE  LITURGY  OF  ST.  JOHN  CHRYSOSTOM 

AND 

THE  LITURGY  OF  ST.  BASIL  THE  GREAT  (i)* 

i.  THE  OFFICE  OF  OBLATION 

When  the  time  is  come  to  celebrate  the  Divine  Liturgy,  the  Priest  entereth  the  Temple, 
and,  in  company  with  the  Deacon,  maketh  three  lowly  reverences  before  the  Holy 
Door. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith: 

Bless,  Master. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Deacon.  O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art 
in  all  places  and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver 
of  life:  Come,  and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from 
every  stain;  and  save  our  souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our 
sins.  O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and 
heal  our  infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy 
kingdom  come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give 
us  this  day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  for- 
give those  who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ; 
But  deliver  us  from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  then  shall  they  say: 
Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  have  mercy  upon  us.     For  we  sinners 
devoid  of  all  defence,  do  offer  unto  thee,  as  to  our  Master,  this  sup- 
plication: Have  mercy  upon  us. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  for  in  thee  have  we  trusted,  and  be 
not  very  wroth  with  us,  neither  call  thou  to  remembrance  our  iniqui-

ties;  but  look  down  even  now  upon  us,  inasmuch  as  thou  art  of  tender 
compassion,  and  deliver  us  from  our  enemies:  for  thou  art  our  God, 
and  we  are  thy  people,  we  are  all  the  work  of  thy  hand,  and  we  call 
upon  thy  Name. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogorodilchen). 
Open  unto  us  the  door  of  thy  loving-kindness,  O  blessed  Birth- 
giver  of  God.     In  that  we  set  our  hope  on  thee  may  we  not  fail,  but 
through  thee  may  we  be  delivered  from  adversities;  for  thou  art  the 
salvation  of  all  Christian  people. 

Then  shall  they  approach  the  holy  picture  (ikona)  of  Christ,  and  shall  kiss  it, 
saying: 

We  do  homage  to  thy  most  pure  image,  O  Good  One,  entreating 
forgiveness  of  our  transgressions,  O  Christ-God;  for  of  thine  own 
good  will  thou  wast  graciously  pleased  to  ascend  the  Cross  in  the 
flesh,  that  thou  mightest  deliver  from  bondage  to  the  enemy  those 
whom  thou  hadst  fashioned ;  for  which  cause  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee 
with  thanksgiving:  With  joy  hast  thou  filled  all  things,  O  our  Sav- 
iour, in  that  thou  didst  come  to  save  the  world. 

In  like  manner  they  shall  kiss  also  the  holy  picture  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  recit- 
ing the  while  this  Hymn,  secretly: 

0  Birth-giver  of  God,  in  that  thou  art  a  well-spring  of  loving-kind- 
ness, vouchsafe  unto  us  thy  compassion.  Look  upon  the  people  who 
have  sinned.  Manifest  thy  power  as  ever;  for  trusting  in  thee  we  cry 
aloud  unto  thee:  Hail!  as  aforetime  did  Gabriel,  Chief  Captain  of  the 
Bodiless  Powers. 

Then,  with  bowed  heads,  they  say  the  following  Prayer: 
Stretch  forth  thy  hand,  O  Lord,  from  thy  holy  dwelling-place  on 
high,  and  strengthen  me  for  this,  thine  appointed  service;  that  stand- 
ing uncondemned  before  thy  dread  Altar,  I  may  fulfil  the  sacred,  un- 
bloody rite.     For  thine  is  the  power  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  they  make  one  reverence  to  the  People,  (2)  and  enter  the  Sanctuary  saying, 
secretly: 

1  will  enter  into  thy  house,  I  will  worship  toward  thy  holy  Temple 
in  thy  fear.  Guide  me,  O  Lord,  with  thy  righteousness;  make 
straight  my  path  before  thee,  because  of  mine  enemies.  For  there  is 
no  truth  in  their  mouth;  their  heart  is  vanity;  their  throat  is  an  open 
sepulchre;  with  their  tongues  have  they  dealt  deceitfully.  Judge 
them,  O  God.  Let  them  fall  through  their  own  counsels:  according  to 
the  multitude  of  their  iniquities  cast  thou  them  out,  for  they  have 
provoked  thee  exceedingly,  O  Lord.  And  let  all  those  who  trust  in 
thee  be  joyful;  and  so  shall  they  rejoice  evermore;  and  thou  shalt 
dwell  in  them  forever.     And  those  who  love  thy  Name  shall  make 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  69 

their  boast  of  thee.     For  thou,  O  Lord,  wilt  bless  the  upright  man. 
As  with  the  panoply  of  thine  approval  hast  thou  crowned  us. 

When  they  enter  the  Sanctuary,  they  make  three  lowly  reverences  of  adoration  be- 
fore the  Holy  Altar,  and  kiss  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  the  Holy  Altar, 
saying: 

O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner,  and  have  mercy  upon  me. 

Then  the  Deacon  approacheth  the  Priest,  holding  in  his  right  hand  his  dalmatic  * 
(stikhdr),  his  stole  (ordr),  and  his  gauntlets  (porutchi);  and  bowing  his  head 
before  the  Priest,  he  saith:  (3) 

Bless,  Master,  the  dalmatic  and  the  stole. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

The  Deacon  then  retireth,  kisseth  the  cross  on  his  dalmatic,  and  putteth  it  on, 
praying  thus: 

My  soul  shall  exult  in  the  Lord.  For  he  hath  endued  me  with  the 
robe  of  salvation,  and  with  the  garment  of  joy  hath  he  clothed  me. 
He  hath  set  a  crown  upon  my  head,  like  unto  a  bridegroom,  and  as  a 
bride  hath  he  adorned  me  with  comeliness. 

Then,  having  kissed  his  stole,  he  layelh  it  on  his  right  shoulder.  And  when  he 
putteth  the  cuffs  on  his  wrists,  he  saith,  as  he  putteth  that  on  the  right: 

Thy  right  hand,  O  Lord,  is  glorified  in  strength.  Thy  right  hand, 
O  Lord,  hath  shattered  the  enemy,  and  through  the  multitude  of  thy 
glory  hast  thou  crushed  the  adversaries. 

And  with  the  left  he  saith: 
Thy  hands  have  made  me  and  fashioned  me.     Enlighten  my  mind, 
and  I  shall  learn  thy  commandments. 

(The  clergy  usually  kiss  each  vestment  before  putting  it  on.) 

Then,  going  to  the  Table  of  Oblation,  he  prepareth  the  Holy  Things.  The  holy 
paten  he  setteth  on  the  left  side;  the  holy  chalice,  which  is  the  holy  cup,  on  the 
right;  and  with  them  the  other  holy  utensils. 

And  the  Priest  vesteth  himself  in  this  wise:  Taking  his  cassock  (podriznik)  in  his 
left  hand,  and  making  three  lowly  reverences  toward  the  east,  as  aforesaid,  he 
signeth  it  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  saying: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

Then  he  putteth  it  on,  saying: 

My  soul  shall  exult  in  the  Lord:         as  the  Deacon  hath  said. 

Then  taking  his  priestly  stole  (epitrakhil) ,  and  signing  it  with  the  sign  of  the 
cross,  he  putteth  it  on,  saying: 

Blessed  is  God,  who  poureth  out  upon  his  priests  his  grace,  like 
unto  the  precious  ointment  on  the  head,  which  ran  down  upon  the 
*  For  explanation,  see  introductory  chapter  on  The  Symbolism  of  the  Church,  p.  xxiv.

beard,  even  upon  the  beard  of  Aaron;  which  ran  down  to  the  skirts  of 
his  garment. 

Then,  taking  the  girdle,  and  girding  himself,  he  saith: 
Blessed  is  God,  who  girdeth  me  with  strength,  and  hath  made  my 
path  blameless,  and  hath  given  me  feet  like  unto  those  of  a  hart,  and 
hath  set  me  on  high. 

Then  he  putteth  on  the  cuffs  as  already  described  for  the  Deacon.    And  taking  his 
epigondtion,  if  he  hath  that  dignity,  he  blesseth  it,  saying: 

Gird  thy  sword  upon  thy  thigh,  O  Mighty  One,  in  thy  vigour,  and 
in  thy  beauty:  and  go  forth,  and  prosper,  and  reign,  because  of  truth, 
and  meekness,  and  righteousness;  and  thy  right  hand  shall  guide  thee 
wondrously  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  his  chasuble  (felon),  he  blesseth  it,  and,  kissing  it,  he  putteth  it  on, 
saying: 

Thy  priests,  O  Lord,  shall  clothe  themselves  with  righteousness, 
and  thy  Holy  Ones  shall  rejoice  with  exultation  always,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  they  shall  wash  their  hands,  saying: 
I  will  wash  my  hands  among  the  innocent,  and  so  will  I  compass 
thine  Altar,  O  Lord ;  that  I  may  hear  the  voice  of  thy  praise,  and  tell 
of  all  thy  wondrous  works.  Lord,  I  have  loved  the  beauty  of  thy 
house,  and  the  place  where  thy  glory  dwelleth.  Destroy  not  my  soul 
with  the  ungodly,  nor  my  life  with  the  men  of  blood,  in  whose  hands 
is  iniquity,  and  their  right  hand  is  full  of  gifts.  But  I  have  walked  in 
mine  innocency:  Deliver  me,  0  Lord,  and  have  mercy  upon  me.  My 
foot  hath  been  set  on  righteousness.  In  the  churches  will  I  bless 
thee,  O  Lord. 

And  thus  they  go  forth  to  the  Chapel  of  Oblation,  making  three  lowly  reverences 
before  the  Table  of  Oblation.     And  each  saith  within  himself: 

O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner,  and  have  mercy  upon  me. 

And:  By  thy  precious  Blood  hast  thou  redeemed  us  from  the  curse 
of  the  Law:  in  that  thou  wast  nailed  to  the  Cross,  and  wast  pierced 
with  a  spear,  thou  hast  poured  forth  immortality  upon  mankind,  as 
from  a  fountain.     O  our  Saviour,  Glory  to  thee. 

If  it  be  not  a  Pontifical  Service,  the  Hours  are  now  read,  while  the  Holy  Gifts  are 
prepared  for  the  Holy  Sacrament. 
Hours.  . 

But  if  it  be  a  Pontifical  Service,  then  the  Hours  are  read  later,  as  indicated. 

Deacon.  Bless,  Master  (aloud,  if  it  be  not  a  Pontifical  Service). 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Deacon.  Amen. 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

Then  the  Priest  taketh  in  his  left  hand  one  of  the  altar-breads,  and  in  his  right 
hand  the  holy  spear;  and  making  therewith  the  sign  of  the  cross,  thrice,  above 
the  seal  of  the  bread,  he  saith: 

In  remembrance  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ. 
{Thrice.) 

And  immediately  he  thrusteth  the  spear  into  the  right  side  of  the  seal  and  as  he 
cutteth  it,  he  saith: 

He  was  led  as  a  sheep  to  the  slaughter. 

And  as  he  cutteth  the  left  side: 

And  as  a  spotless  lamb  before  his  shearers  is  dumb,  so  opened  he 
not  his  mouth. 

And  at  the  top  of  the  seal: 

In  his  humiliation  his  judgment  was  taken  away. 

And  at  the  bottom: 
For  his  generation,  who  shall  declare  it? 

And  the  Deacon,  gazing  reverently  at  the  Holy  Mystic  Rite,  as  each  incision  is 
made  saith,  holding  his  stole  in  his  hand  the  while: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  when  the  Priest,  having  thrust  the  spear,  obliquely,  from  below,  into  the 
right  side  of  the  bread,  taketh  away  the  whole  part  with  the  seal,  thus  cut,  the 
Deacon  saith: 

Master,  take  away- 

And  the  Priest  saith: 

For  his  life  is  taken  away  from  the  earth. 

And  having  laid  it,  inverted,  on  the  holy  paten,  and  the  Deacon  having  said: 
Sacrifice,  Master. 

He  sacrificeth,  cutting  it  crosswise,  but  leaving  the  seal  intact,  and  saying: 

Sacrificed  is  the  Lamb  of  God  who  taketh  away  the  sins  of  the 
world,  for  the  life  of  the  world,  and  for  its  salvation. 

He  then  turneth  upward  the  other  side,  which  hath  upon  it  the  emblem  of  the 
Cross.    And  as  he  pierceth  the  right  side  with  the  spear,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Pierce,  Master. 

And  the  Priest:  One  of  the  soldiers  did  pierce  his  side  with  a  spear, 
and  straightway  there  came  forth  blood  and  water.  And  he  that  saw 
it  bare  witness,  and  his  witness  is  true.

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 


Then  the  Deacon  poureth  into  the  holy  chalice  the  mingled  wine  and  water,  in 
amount  according  to  the  number  of  communicants,  having  first  said  to  the 
Priest: 

Bless,  Master,  the  holy  union. 

And  the  Priest  blesseth  it,  saying: 
Blessed  be  the  union  of  thy  Holy  Things  always,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  in  his  hand  another  altar-bread,  the  Priest  shall  say: 
In  honour  and  commemoration   of  our   most  blessed   Lady,   the 
Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever- virgin  Mary;  through  whose  interces- 
sions accept,  O  Lord,  this  sacrifice  upon  thy  most  heavenly  Altar. 

And  with  the  spear  taking  out  a  portion,  he  layeth  it  on  the  right  side  of  the  Holy 
Bread,  near  the  centre  thereof,  saying: 

On  thy  right  hand  stood  the  Queen,  clothed  in  a  vesture  wrought 
with  gold  and  divers  colours. 

Then  taking  the  third  altar-bread,  he  saith: 
In  commemoration  of  the  most  honourable  and  glorious  prophet, 
Forerunner  and  Baptist,  John. 

And  taking  out  the  first  particle,  he  placeth  it  on  the  left  hand  of  the  Holy  Bread, 
making  the  beginning  of  the  first  row.     Then  he  saith: 

Of  the  holy,  glorious  Prophets,  Moses  and  Aaron;  Elijah  and 
Elisha;  David  and  Jesse;  of  the  Three  Holy  Children,  also  of  Daniel 
the  Prophet;  and  of  all  the  holy  prophets. 

And  taking  out  another  particle,  he  placeth  it  below  the  first,  in  due  order.     Then 

he  saith: 
Of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles,  Peter  and  Paul; 
and  of  all  the  other  holy  Apostles. 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  73 

In  the  same  manner,  he  placeth  a  third  particle  below  the  second,  thus  completing 
the  first  rank.     Arid  he  saith: 

Of  our  holy  Fathers  and  Saints,  the  Prelates  Basil  the  Great,  Greg- 
ory the  Theologian  and  John  Chrysostom;  Athanasius  and  Kyril, 
Nicholas  of  Myra  in  Lycia;  (Peter,  Alexis,  Jonah  and  Philip  of  Mos- 
cow;) Nikita,  Bishop  of  Novgorod,  Le6nty,  Bishop  of  Rostoff;  and  of 
all  thy  holy  Prelates. 

And  taking  out  a  fourth  particle,  he  placeth  it  beside  the  first  particle,  making  a 
second  beginning.     And  he  saith: 

Of  the  holy  Apostle  and  First  Martyr  and  Archdeacon,  Stephen; 
of  the  holy  Great  Martyrs  Demetrius,  George,  Theodore  of  Tyre, 
Theodore  the  Strategist;  and  of  all  holy  Martyrs,  both  men  and 
women;  of  Thekla,  Barbara,  Kyriaka,  Euphemia,  Paraskeva,  Kather- 
ine;  and  of  all  other  holy  martyred  women. 

And  taking  out  a  fifth  particle,  he  placeth  it  below  the  first,  which  is  in  the  second 
row.     And  he  saith: 

Of  our  devout  and  God-bearing  Fathers,  Anthony,  Euthymius, 
Sabba,  Onuphrius,  Athanasius  of  Mount  Athos,  Anthony  and  Theo- 
dosius  of  the  Catacombs,  Sergius  of  Radonezh,  Barlaam  of  Khutinsk; 
and  of  all  our  devout  fathers;  and  of  our  devout  mothers  in  God, 
Pelagia,  Theodosia,  Anastasia,  Eupraxia,  Fevronia,  Theodulia,  Euph- 
rosyne,  Mary  of  Egypt;  and  of  all  our  holy  and  devout  mothers. 

And  in  like  manner,  taking  out  a  sixth  particle,  he  placeth  it  below  the  second, 
completing  the  second  row.     After  which  he  saith: 

Of  the  holy  and  wonder-working  Unmercenaries  Cosmas  and  Da- 
mian,  Cyrus  and  John,  Panteleimon,  Hermolaus;  and  of  all  the  Holy 
Unmercenaries. 

And  taking  out  a  seventh  particle,  he  placeth  it  above,  making  the  beginning  of  the 
third  row.     Then  he  saith: 

Of  the  holy  and  righteous  Ancestors  of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna. 
And  of  Saint  N.  {the  Saint  of  the  Church)  and  of  Saint  N.  {the  Saint  of 
the  day);  arad  of  Saint  Methodius  and  Saint  Kyril,  the  Equals  of  the 
Apostles  the  Evangelizers  of  the  Slavonians,  and  of  all  the  Saints; 
through  whose  supplications  do  thou  visit  us,  O  Lord. 

Then  he  layeth  the  eighth  particle  below  the  former,  in  due  order.    And  thereafter 
he  saith: 

Of  our  Father  in  the  Saints,  John  Chrysostom,  Bishop  of  Constan- 
tinople {if  his  Liturgy  is  to  be  celebrated.  But  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil 
the  Great  is  to  be  celebrated,  then  shall  he  be  commemorated  instead). 

Then  taking  out  the  ninth  particle,  he  placeth  it  at  the  end  of  the  third  row,  com- 
pleting it.     And  taking  the  fourth  altar-bread,  he  saith: 

Remember,  O  Lord,  Lover  of  mankind,  every  Bishopric  over  Or- 


74  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

thodox  Christians;  the  Most  Holy  Governing  Synod,  and  Orthodox 
Patriarchs;  and  our  Bishop,  N.;  the  honourable  Priesthood,  the  Diac- 
onate  in  Christ,  and  every  Sacerdotal  Order;  our  brethren  and  fellow- 
ministers,  the  priests,  the  deacons,  and  all  our  brethren  whom  thou 
hast  called  into  thy  communion,  through  thy  tenderness  of  heart,  O 
all-good  Lord. 

And  taking  out  a  portion,  he  layeth  it  below  the  Holy  Bread.  Then  he  com- 
memorateth  the  Ruler,  saying: 

Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.  (4) 

Then  he  maketh  mention,  by  name,  of  the  living  who  are  to  be  prayed  for,  if  any 
such  there  be;  and  at  each  name  he  taketh  out  a  particle,  saying: 

Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  N. 

Having  thus  taken  out  the  particles,  the,  Priest  placeth  them  below  the  Holy  i 
Bread.     Then  taking  the  fifth  altar-bread,  he  saith: 

In  memory,  and  for  the  remission  of  sins,  of  the  most  holy  Patri- 
archs; of  Orthodox  and  God-fearing  Rulers;  and  of  the  blessed  found- 
ers of  this  holy  Temple. 

Then  shall  he  make  mention  of  the  Bishop  who  ordained  him;  and  of  whatsoever 
persons  he  may  desire,  who  have  departed  this  life,  by  name.  And  at  each 
name,  he  shall  take  out  a  particle,  saying: 

Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  N. 

And,  in  conclusion,  he  shall  say  as  followeth: 

And  of  all  our  Orthodox  fathers  and  brethren  who  have  fallen 
asleep  in  the  hope  of  resurrection,  of  life  eternal,  and  of  communion 
with  thee,  O  Lord,  who  lovest  mankind. 

And  he  taketh  out  a  particle.     Thereafter  he  saith: 
Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  my  unworthy  self,  and  pardon  me 
every  transgression,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary. 

And  he  taketh  out  of  the  fourth  prosford  a  particle.  Then,  taking  the  sponge,  he 
gather eth  together  the  particles  taken  from  the  fourth  and  fifth  prosfori  on  the 
paten,  below  the  Holy  Bread,  so  that  they  may  be  in  safety,  and  that  none  of 
them  may  fall.  Then  the  Deacon  taketh  the  censer,  and  having  placed  incense 
therein,  he  saith  to  the  Priest: 

Bless,  Master,  the  censer, 

And  straightway  he  saith: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest  saith  the  Prayer  of  the  Censer. 

Unto  thee,  O  Christ-God,  do  we  offer  incense  for  an  odour  of  spirit- 
ual fragrance:  which  do  thou  accept  upon  thy  most  heavenly  Altar, 
and  pour  forth  upon  us  in  return  the  grace  of  thine  all-holy  Spirit. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.

Then  the  Priest,  having  censed  the  star-cover,  placeth  it  over  the  Holy  Bread, 
saying: 

And  the  Star  came  and  stood  over  the  place  where  the  young 
Child  was. 
Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

The  Priest,  having  censed  the  first  veil,  covereth  therewith  the  Holy  Bread,  saying: 

The  Lord  is  King,  and  hath  put  on  glorious  apparel;  the  Lord  hath 
put  on  his  apparel,  and  girded  himself  with  strength.  He  hath  made 
the  round  world  so  sure,  that  it  cannot  be  moved.  Ever  since  the 
world  began  hath  thy  seat  been  prepared:  thou  art  from  everlasting. 
The  floods  are  risen,  O  Lord,  the  floods  have  lift  up  their  voice;  the 
floods  lift  up  their  waves.  The  waves  of  the  sea  are  mighty,  and 
rage  horribly;  but  yet  the  Lord,  who  dwelleth  on  high,  is  mightier. 
Thy  testimonies,  O  Lord,  are  very  sure:  holiness  becometh  thine 
house  forever. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Cover,  Master. 

The  Priest,  having  censed  the  second  veil,  covereth  therewith  the  holy  chalice, 
saying: 

Thy  virtue,  O  Christ,  hath  covered  the  heavens,  and  the  earth  also 
is  full  of  thy  praise. 
Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Cover,  Master. 

The  Priest,  having  censed  the  veil,  that  is  to  say,  the  air  (vozdukh),  covereth  there- 
with the  paten  and  chalice,  saying: 

Cover  us  with  the  shelter  of  thy  wings,  and  drive  away  from  us 
every  foe  and  adversary-  Order  our  lives  in  peace,  O  Lord;  have 
mercy  upon  us,  and  upon  thy  world,  and  save  our  souls;  forasmuch  as 
thou  art  good  and  lovest  mankind. 

Then,  taking  the  censer,  the  Priest  censeth  the  Table  of  Oblation,  saying  thrice: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  our  God,  who  herein  art  well  pleased.     Glory 
to  thee. 

And  each  time  the  Deacon  shall  respond: 

Always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  both  make  three  devout  reverences.     And  the  Deacon,  taking  the  censer, 
saith: 

For  the  Precious  Gifts  now  offered  up,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Then  the  Priest  maketh  the  Prayer  of  Oblation  : 

O  God  our  God,  who  didst  send  forth  the  Heavenly  Bread,  the 
Nourishment  of  the  whole  world,  our  Lord  and  God,  Jesus  Christ,  to 
be  our  Saviour  and  Redeemer  and  Benefactor,  blessing  and  sanctify- 
ing us:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  bless  also  this  oblation,  and  accept  it 


70  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

on  thy  most  heavenly  Altar.  Call  to  remembrance  those  who  offer  it, 
and  those  for  whom  it  is  offered,  inasmuch  as  thou  art  good  and  lovest 
mankind;  and  preserve  us  blameless  in  the  holy  ministry  of  thy  Di- 
vine Mysteries. 

For  sanctified  and  glorified  be  thy  most  honourable  and  majestic 
Name,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Dismissal,  saying: 
Glory  to  thee,  0  Christ-God  our  hope;  glory  to  thee. 
Deacon.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 
Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 
Master,  bless. 

Then  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Benediction.     If  it  be  Sunday: 
May  he  who  rose  again  from  the  dead,  Christ  our  true  God,  .  .  . 

But  if  it  be  not  Sunday: 

May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  intercessions  of  his  all-unde- 
filed  Mother;  of  our  Father  among  the  Saints,  John  Chrysostom, 
Bishop  of  Constantinople  (or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  be  used:  of 
Basil  the  Great,  of  Csesarea  in  Cappadocia) ;  and  of  all  the  Saints,    q 
have  mercy  upon  us,  and  save  us:  for  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

Deacon.  Amen. 

After  the  Benediction,  the  Deacon  censeth  the  Holy  Oblation.  Then  (if  the  Ponti- 
fical Service  is  to  follow,  see  page  78.  If  not:)  he  goeth  and  censeth  the  Holy 
Altar  round  about,  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  saying,  secretly:  (5) 

In  the  grave  with  the  body,  but  in  Hell  with  the  soul,  in  that  thou 
art  God;  in  Paradise  with  the  thief,  and  on  the  throne  with  the  Father 
and  the  Spirit,  wast  thou,  O  Christ,  filling  all  things,  in  that  thou  art 
infinite. 

Then  he  shall  recite  Psalm  li.:  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great 
goodness;  (See  page  45). 

Meanwhile,  he  censeth  the  Sanctuary  and  all  the  Temple,  and  returneth  again  to 
the  Holy  Altar;  and  having  again  censed  it  and  the  Priest,  he  putteth  the  censer 
aside  in  its  place,  and  approacheth  the  Priest.  And  standing  together  before 
the  Holy  Altar,  they  make  three  lowly  reverences,  praying  secretly,  and  saying: 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all 
places  and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things,  and  Giver  of  life: 
Come,  and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain; 
and  save  our  souls,  O  Good  One. 

Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  wjll  towards 
men.  (Twice.)  O  Lord,  open  thou  my  lips,  and  my  mouth  shall 
show  forth  thy  praise.

Then  the  Priest  kisseth  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  the  Deacon  kisseth  the 
Holy  Altar.  Then  the  Deacon,  bowing  his  head  before  the  Priest,  and  holding 
his  stole  with  three  fingers,  saith: 

It  is  time  to  sacrifice  unto  the  Lord.     Bless,  Master. 
And  the  (Bishop  or  the)  Priest,  signing  him  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  saith: 
Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Deacon.  Pray  for  me,  holy  Master. 
(Bishop  or)  Priest.  May  the  Lord  direct  thy  steps. 
Deacon.  Remember  me,  holy  Master. 

(Bishop  or)  Priest.  May  the  Lord  God  remember  thee  in  his  king- 
dom always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Deacon.  Amen. 

And  having  made  a  humble  reverence,  he  goeth  out  through  the  north  door,  and 
standing  in  his  accustomed  place  before  the  Holy  Door,  he  thrice  boweth  his 
head  reverently,  and  saith,  secretly : 

O  Lord,  open  thou  my  lips,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  forth  thy 
praise. 

Thereafter  he  beginneth,  aloud: 

Bless,  Master.     (See  page  80.) 

//  the  Priest  celebrate  without  a  Deacon,  the  words  assigned  to  the  Deacon  in  the 
Office  of  Oblation  and  in  the  Liturgy,  before  the  Gospel  are  read;  and  in 
response:  Bless,  Master;  and:  Pierce,  Master;  and:  It  is  time  to  sacrifice: 
shall  not  be  said.  As,  likewise,  the  litany  and  oblation  of  ranks.  But  if  many 
Priests  serve,  as  in  a  Cathedral,  only  one  Priest  shall  perform  the  Office  of  Obla- 
tion, and  shall  say  what  is  herein  set  forth;  but  no  other  of  the  Priests  shall  say 
that  Office  separately.  They  are  allowed  only  to  take  out  the  particles  for  the 
living  and  the  dead. 

If  a  Pontifical  Service  is  to  follow,  then,  after  the  Benediction  of  the  Office  of  Bishop. 
Oblation,  the  Priest  who  hath  celebrated  the  Office  of  Oblation  (and  the  other 
Priests,  in  their  cassocks),  bearmg  a  cross  upon  a  salver,  accompanied  by  the 
Proto-Deacon  or  Deacon  with  the  censer  and  taper,  the  crozier -bearer  with  the 
Bishop's  crozier,  and  the  Sub-Deacons  with  the  mantle  and  the  eagle-rugs,  go 
forth  to  meet  the  Bishop  at  the  western  door.  As  the  Bishop  enter eth  the  Tem- 
ple, the  Deacon  exclaimeth:  Wisdom !  And  the  Bishop  saith,  secretly:  I  will 
enter  into  thy  house  (see  page  68).    He  is  then  vested  in  his  mantle,  and 

kisseth  the  cross,  and  giveth  it  to  be  kissed  by  all  the  Priests  who  are  preparing 
to  celebrate  the  Liturgy;  and  then,  while  the  Choir  singeth:  Meet  is  it: 
More  honourable  .  and,  while  he  saluteth  the  holy  pictures  of  our  Lord  and 
of  His  Mother,  and  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Church,  he  reciteth  the  prescribed 
hymns  (see  page  107),  supporting  himself  on  his  crozier,  he  approacheth  the 
Holy  Door,  and  there  giveth  the  blessing  for  the  Prayer  of  Entrance,  as 
shown  above.     (See  page  68.) 

After  the  Prayer:  Stretch  forth  thy  hand,  O  Lord  (see  page  68),  the  Bishop 

turneih  his  face  towards  the  People,  and  blesseth  the  worshippers,  while  the 
Choir  singeth:

78  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

The  Bishop  then  goeth  to  his  dais;  the  Clergy  ask  his  blessing,  and  withdraw  into 
the  Sanctuary  to  vest  themselves.  The  Priest  who  hath  celebrated  the  Office  of 
Oblation  blesseth  the  beginning  of  the  Hours: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Reader.  Amen. 

And  he  readeth  the  Third  Hour  and  the  Sixth  Hour. 
Choir.  The  prophets  proclaimed  thee  from  on  high,  O  Virgin,  the 
Jar,  the  Staff,  the  Tables  of  the  Law,  the  Ark,  the  Candlestick,  the 
Table,  the  Mount  Uncloven,  the  Golden  Censer,  and  the  Tabernacle, 
the  Gate  Impassable,  the  Palace  and  Ladder,  and  the  Throne  of 
Kings. 

Meanwhile  the  Sub-Deacons  begin  to  vest  the  Bishop,  having  first  removed  his 
mantle,  cowl,  pectoral  holy  image,  and  outer  cassock.  While  the  Bishop's 
vestments  are  being  put  upon  him,  the  Proto-Deacon,  censer  in  hand,  reciteth 
the  same  Verses  which  the  Priests  recite  as  they  vest  themselves.  (See  above.) 
Or,  sometimes,  they  are  chanted  by  the  Choir,  the  Proto-Deacon  exclaiming  be- 
fore each:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord ;  and  using  the  second  person,  and  substitut- 
ing for  "Priests"  the  word  "Bishops,"  and  so  forth. 

When  the  pall  (omofor)  is  put  on,  the  Deacon  saith: 
When  thou  hadst  taken  upon  thy  shoulders  human  nature  which 
had  gone  astray,  O  Christ,  thou  didst  bear  it  to  heaven,  unto  thy  God 
and  Father,  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  with  the  pectoral  holy  image  he  saith: 
May  God  create  in  thee  a  clean  heart,  and  renew  a  right  spirit 
within  thee,  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

At  the  second  pectoral  image  (if  there  be  one),  he  saith: 
Thy  heart  is  inditing  of  a  good  matter;  thou  shalt  speak  of  thy 
deeds  unto  the  King,  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

And  with  the  cross  he  saith: 
If  any  man  will  come  after  me,  let  him  deny  himself,  saith  the 
Lord,  and  take  up  his  cross  and  follow  me,  always,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  with  the  mitre  he  saith: 
The  Lord  hath  set  upon  thy  head  a  crown  of  precious  stones.  Thou 
askedst  life  of  him,  and  he  shall  give  thee  length  of  days,  always, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon  standeth  aside,  and  the  Sub-Deacons  enter  the  Sanctuary, 
and  taking  from  the  Clergy  the  dikiri  and  the  trikiri,  they  bear  them  to  the 
Bishop.     And  the  Proto-Deacon  saith: 

May  thy  light  so  shine  before  men  that  they  may  see  thy  good 
works  and  glorify  our  Father  which  is  in  heaven,  always,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

When  the  Sixth  Hour  approacheth  its  close,  all  the  Clergy,  having  vested  them- 
selves, come  forth  from  the  Sanctuary  through  the  north  door,  and  taking  their 
stand  beside  the  Bishop,  begin  to  pray:

If  a  Bishop  be  the  celebrant,  he 

saith  here,  secretly,  the  Prayer        op" 
of  Oblation. 

O  God  our  God,  who  didst 
send  forth  the  Heavenly  Bread, 
the  Nourishment  of  the  whole 
world,  our  Lord  and  God,  Jesus 
Christ,  to  be  our  Saviour  and 
Redeemer  and  Benefactor, 
blessing  and  sanctifying  us :  Do 
thou,  the  same  Lord,  bless  also 
this  oblation,  and  accept  it  on 
thy  most  heavenly  Altar.  Call 
to  remembrance  those  who 
offer  it,  and  those  for  whom  it 
is  offered,  inasmuch  as  thou  art 
good  and  lovest  mankind;  and 
preserve  us  blameless  in  the 
holy  ministry  of  thy  Divine 
Mysteries. 

For  sanctified  and  glorified 
be  thy  most  honourable  and 
majestic  Name,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

saith,  secretly,  the  Prayer  of  the 
Second  Antiphon.

And  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Anti-

stand  again  in  his  accustomed 
place,  and  shall  say:

Here  shall  be  sung  the  Second  Antiphon,  Psalm  cxlvi.  (or  on  the  Great  Feasts  its 
appointed  substitute).* 

Praise  the  Lord,  O  my  soul:  while  I  live,  will  I  praise  the  Lord;  yea,  as 
long  as  I  have  any  being,  I  will  sing  praises  unto  my  God.  Blessed  is  he 
that  hath  the  God  of  Jacob  for  his  help,  and  whose  hope  is  in  the  Lord  his 
God;  who  made  the  sea,  and  all  that  therein  is;  who  keepeth  his  promise 
forever.  Who  helpeth  them  to  right  that  suffer  wrong;  who  feedeth  the 
hungry.  The  Lord  looseth  men  out  of  prison ;  the  Lord  giveth  sight  to  the 
blind.  The  Lord  helpeth  them  that  are  fallen;  the  Lord  careth  for  the 
righteous.  The  Lord  careth  for  the  strangers;  he  defendeth  the  father- 
less and  widow:  as  for  the  way  of  the  ungodly,  he  turneth  it  upside  down. 
The  Lord  thy  God,  O  Sion,  shall  be  King  forevermore. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

Blessed  are  the  merciful:  for 
they  shall  obtain  mercy.  Blessed 
are  the  pure  in  heart:  for  they 
shall  see  God.  Blessed  are  the 
peacemakers:  for  they  shall  be

Blessed  are  they  which  are  perse-

The  Priest  sa-ith  the  Prayer  of  the 
Little  Entrance  while  the  last 
portion  of  the  Beatitudes  is  being 
sung. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who 
hast  appointed  in  heaven  ranks 
and  hosts  of  Angels  and  Arch- 
angels for  the  ministry  of  thy 
glory:  Cause  that  with  our  en- 
trance may  enter  also  the  holy 
Angels  with  us  serving  thee, 
and  with  us  glorifying  thy  good- 
ness. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory, 
honour  and  worship,  to  the  Fa-

Deacons  with  the  dikiri  and  trikiri

their   rank;  and  the  whole  proces- 
sion, while  the  Beatitudes  are 
being  sung,  maketh  the  circuit    e/p^tJ1.011 
of    the    Altar,     and    coming    Deacons 
forth,  through  the  north  door, 
goeth    to    the   Bishop's   dais. 
And  there  the  Proto-Deacon  standeth 
in  front  of  the  Bishop. 

Proto-Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to 
the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Proto-Deacon.  Bless,  Right 
Reverend  Master,  the  Holy  En- 
trance. 

Bishop.  Blessed  is  the  En- 
trance of  thy  Holy  Ones,  always, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

The  Bishop  kisseth  the  Holy  Gospels. 

Proto-Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  Be- 
lievers ! 

The  Clergy  who  are  taking  part  in  the 
service  sing: 

O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ.  Save,  O 
Son  of  God,  who  didst  rise  again 
from  the  dead,*  us  who  sing  unto 
thee:  Alleluia. 

The  Bishop  bestoweth  the  blessing  with 
the  dikiri  and  trikiri,  on  all  four 
sides,  as  after  his  vesting.  And  all 
proceed  to  the  Sanctuary,  where  the 
Bishop,  bearing  the  dikiri  and  cen- 
ser, accompanied  by  the  Proto-Dea- 
con bearing  the  trikiri,  censeth  the 
Holy  Altar,  the  image-screen,  and

Blessed  are  ye  when  men  shall

against  you  falsely,  for  my  sake. 

Then  the  Priest,  taking  the  book  of 
the  Holy  Gospels  from  the  Altar, 
giveth  it  to  the  Deacon;  and  pre- 
ceded by  a  light,  they  both  make 
the  Lesser  Entrance. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the 
Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Rejoice,  and  be  exceeding  glad ;

Choir    Amen. 

Then  the  Deacon  shall  go  to  the 
Priest,  and  the  Priest  shall  kiss  the 
book  of  the  Holy  Gospels;  and  the 
Deacon  shall  come  to  the  centre  of 
the  Holy  Door,  and  there  standing 
in  front  of  the  Priest,  he  shall 
elevate  the  Holy  Gospels,  and 
shall  say,  so  that  all  may  hear: 

Wisdom,  O  believers!    (8) 

Then  shall  they  go  to  the  Holy  Al-

Gospels  on  the  Altar,  and  the 
Choir  shall  sing:

The  Priest,  secretly. 
O  holy  God,  who  restest 
in  the  Saints;  who  art 
hymned  by  the  Seraphim 
with  a  thrice-holy  cry,  and 
glorified  by  the  Cherubim, 
and  adored  by  every  hea- 
venly Power;  who  out  of 
nothingness  hast  brought 
all  things  into  being;  who 
hast  created  man  after 
thine  own  image  and  like- 
ness, and  hast  adorned  him 
with  every  gift  of  thine; 
who  givest  unto  those  that 
ask  of  thee  wisdom  and  un- 
derstanding; who  despisest 
not  the  sinner,  but  hast 
appointed  repentance  unto 
salvation;  and  hast  vouch- 
safed unto  us,  thy  humble 
and  unworthy  servants 
here,  at  this  hour,  to  stand 
before  the  glory  of  thy 
holy  Altar,  and  to  render 
unto  thee  that  adoration 
and  praise  which  are  thy 
due:  Do  thou,  the  same 
Lord,  accept  from  the 
mouths  of  us  sinners,  the 
Thrice-Holy  song,  and  visit 
us  with  thy  beneficence. 
Pardon  us  every  transgres- 
sion, whether  voluntary  or 
involuntary.  Sanctify  both 
our  souls  and  bodies,  and 
grant  that  we  may  serve 
thee  in  uprightness  all  the 
days  of  our  life:  through 
the  intercessions  of  the 
holy  Birth-giver  of  God, 
and  of  all  the  Saints  of  all 
the  ages  who  have  been 
well-pleasing  unto  thee. 


If  it  be  at  a  Pontifical  Service,  the  last 
Collect-Hymn  is  omitted,  and  the 
Proto -Deacon,  coming  forth  from  the 
Sanctuary,  saith: 

O  Lord,  save  the  God-fearing. 

And  the  Choir  singeih  the  same. 

Proto-Deacon.  And  hear  us. 
Choir.  And  hear  us. 

Then  {in  Russian  Churches)  the  Proto- 
Deacon  saith  the  Great  Eulogy. 

To  His  Holiness,  the  Patriarch  of 
All-Russia,  N.,  many  years! 

And  the  Clergy  and  the  Choir  repeat  the 
same. 

Proto-Deacon.  To  our  Most  God- 
fearing Ruler,  N.,  and  to  all  the  Au-

And  the  Choir  singeth  the  same. 

Proto-Deacon.  To  our  Lord,  the

The  Choir  repeat  the  same,  and  the  Bishop, 
after  each  "many  years!"  blesseth  all,

of  the  Thrice-Holy.

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 


And  when  the  Choir  come  to  the 
last  Hymn,  the  Deacon  shall  say 
to  the  Priest,  as  both  bow  their 
heads,  and  he  holdelh  his  stole 
with  three  fingers: 

Bless,  Master,  the  time  of 
the  Thrice-Holy. 

A  nd  the  Priest  shall  bless  him,  with 
the  sign  of  the  cross,  and  shall  say, 
aloud: 

For  holy  art  thou,  O  our

glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the 
Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,

Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  when  the  Hymn  is  finished,  the 
Deacon  shall  come  close  to  the 
Holy  Door,  and  pointing  with 
his  stole,  first  to  the  holy  picture  of 
Christ,  he  shall  say: 

O  Lord,  save  the  God-fear- 
ing, and  hear  us. 

Then  shall  he  point,  in  like  man- 
ner, to  those  who  stand  without, 
and  shall  say: 

Even  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 
And  then  the  Choir:

Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mer-

Amen. 

We,  thy  servants,  in  that  we  have 
been  delivered  from  calamity,  do 
offer  unto  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of 
God,  who  as  a  victorious  Chieftain 
warrest  for  us,  songs  of  triumph 
and  thanksgiving.  Do  thou  also,  in 
that  thou  hast  might  invincible, 
free  us  from  all  assaults,  that  we 
may  cry  unto  thee:  Hail,  O  Bride 
Unwedded !

Bishop.  For  holy  art  thou,  O  our 
God,  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory, 
to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and 
to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever; 

And  the  Proto-Deacon,  standing  near 
the  Holy  Door,  and  holding  his  stole 
with  three  fingers,  and  pointing  there-

Even  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir    Amen.      O     Holy    God,

The  Priests  repeat  the  same  once* 
The  Choir  repeateth  the  same  once. 
After  the  third  repetition,  the   Bishop, 
holding  the  cross  and  the  dikiri,  saith, 
with  his  face  towards  the  People: 


Look  down  from  heaven,  O  God,

tide and  at  Pentecost,  in  place  of  the  Thrice-Holy  shall  be  sung:

And  the  Deacon  shall  say  to 
the  Priest: 

Command,  Master. 

Then  shall  they,  approach  the 
Holy  Throne,  and  as  he  ap- 
proacheth,  the  Priest  shall 
say: 

Blessed  is  he  that  Com- 
eth in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord. 

Deacon.  Bless,  Master, 
the  seat  on  high. 

Priest.  Blessed  art  thou 
on  the  throne  of  glory  of 
thy  kingdom,  who  sittest 
on  the  Cherubim,  always, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 
The  Priest  doth  not  ascend  the 

High  Place,  nor  sit  upon  it, 

but  taketh  his  seat  beside  it,

Deacon.  Command,  Most  Rever-

Bishop.  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh 
in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 
And  while  the  Choir  singeth  the  Thrice- 
Holy  for  the  fourth  time,  the  Bishop 
bestoweth  the  blessing  with  the  cross 
and  the  dikiri.  Then  the  Clergy  and 
the  Choir  each  repeat  the  Thrice-Holy 
once  more. 

Here  Bishops  are  ordained. 

Proto-Deacon.  Bless,  Right  Re-

Bishop.  Blessed  art  thou  on  the

The  Bishop  then  ascendeth  the  High 
Place,  and  standeth  there,  looking 
towards  the  People.  And  he  giveth 
the  dikiri  to  the  Deacon.  And  the 
Proto-Deacon  giveth  the  trikiri  to 
the  Bishop,  reciting  the  Hymn. 

In  Jordan  was  the  Trinity  made  manifest;  for  the  Most-Divine  Per- 
son of  the  Father  Himself  proclaimed :  He  that  is  baptized,  the  same  is 
my  beloved  Son.  And  the  Spirit  descended  upon  Him  that  was  like  unto 
Himself.  For  which  cause  men  shall  bless  Him  and  exalt  Him  forever. 

The  Bishop  taketh  the  trikiri,  and  blesseth  thrice  with  the  trikiri,  as  usual.    When 
the  Bishop  giveth  the  trikiri  to  the  Deacon: 

Choir.  Glory  now,  and  ever  .  .     Amen.  O  Holy  Immortal  One,

O  Lord  our  God,  who  art  great

The  First  Prayer  of  the  Faithful. 
The  Priest,  secretly. 
We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  Lord  God  of 
the  Powers,  who  hast  graciously  vouchsafed 
unto  us  to  stand  now  before  thy  holy  Altar, 
and  fall  down  in  adoration  before  thy  compas- 
sion toward  our  sins,  and  the  errors  of  the 
people.  Accept  our  supplications,  O  God ;  make  us  worthy  to  offer 
unto  thee  prayers  and  supplications,  and  unbloody  sacrifices  for  all 
thy  people.  And  enable  us,  whom  thou  hast  appointed  to  this  thy 
ministry,  by  the  power  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  at  all  times,  and  in  every 
place,  blamelessly,  without  offence,  and  in  the  witness  of  a  pure  con- 
science, to  call  upon  thee;  that  hearing  us  thou  mayest  show  mercy 
upon  us,  according  to  the  plenitude  of  thy  goodness. 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  used: 

Thou,  O  Lord,  hast  shown  us  this  great  mystery  of  salvation. 
Thou  hast  graciously  permitted  us,  thy  humble  and  unworthy  ser- 
vants, to  be  the  ministrants  of  thy  holy  Altar.  Do  thou  enable  us 
with  the  power  of  thy  Holy  Spirit  for  this  ministry;  that,  stand- 
ing uncondemned  before  thy  holy  glory,  we  may  offer  unto  thee  an 
oblation  of  praise.  For  thou  art  he  who  worketh  all  things  in  all 
men.  Grant,  therefore,  O  Lord,  that  our  sacrifice  for  our  own  sins, 
and  for  the  errors  of  thy  people,  may  be  acceptable  and  well-pleas- 
ing in  thy  sight.]     Deacon.  Wisdom!

Priest.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  honour,  glory  and  worship,  to  the

heavenly  kingdom. 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the 
Great  be  used: 


O  God,  who  in  mercy  and  boun- 
ties   hast    visited    our    lowliness; 
who  hast  set  us,  thy  humble,  and 
sinful,  and  unworthy  servants  be-

ance, in  the  opening  of  our  lips,  to  invoke  the  grace  of  thy  Holy

No  one  who  is  in  bondage  unto 
carnal  desires  and  sensual  pleasures 
is  worthy  to  approach,  or  to  come 
near,  or  to  serve  thee,  O  King  of 
Glory:  For  to  serve  thee  is  a  great 
and  terrible  thing  even  to  the 
Heavenly  Powers.  Nevertheless, 
through  thine  unutterable  and 
boundless  love  toward  mankind 
thou  didst  become  man,  yet  without 
change,  and  without  transmutation,

and  art  become  our  High  Priest,  and  hast  committed  unto  us  the 
ministry  of  this  unbloody  Sacrifice,  in  that  thou  art  Lord  over  all. 
For  thou  alone,  O  Lord  our  God,  rulest  over  those  in  heaven  and  on 
earth;  who  art  borne  on  the  throne  of  the  Cherubim;  who  art  Lord 
of  the  Seraphim  and  King  over  Israel;  who  alone  art  holy  and  restest 
in  the  Saints.  Therefore  do  I  now  make  my  entreaty  unto  thee, 
who  alone  art  good  and  art  ready  to  listen:  Look  down  upon  me,  a 
sinner,  and  thine  unprofitable  servant,  and  cleanse  my  soul  and  my 
heart  from  an  evil  conscience;  and  by  the  might  of  thy  Holy  Spirit 
enable  me,  who  am  endued  with  the  grace  of  the  priesthood,  to  stand 
before  this  thy  holy  Altar,  and  perform  the  sacred  Mystery  of  thy 
Holy  and  Pure  Body  and  Precious  Blood.  For  unto  thee  do  I  draw 
near,  and  bowing  my  neck  I  implore  thee :  turn  not  thy  face  from  me, 
neither  cast  me  out  from  among  thy  children ;  but  graciously  vouch- 
safe tliat  I,  a  sinner -and  thine  unworthy  servant,  may  offer  unto  thee 
these  Holy  Gifts.  For  it  is  thou  who  offerest  and  art  offered,  who  re- 
ceivest  and  art  thyself  received,  O  Christ  our  God:  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father,  who  is  from  everlasting,  and 
thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

(At  a  Pontifical  Service  the  Bishop  washeth  his  hands,  saying  the  prayer:  Bishop, 
0  Lord  our  God  see  page  79.)  Then  the  Deacon  taketh  the  censer,  and 
having  received  the  Priest's  blessing,  he  censeth  the  Holy  Altar  round  about, 
and  the  Sanctuary,  saying,  secretly,  to  himself,  Psalm  li.:  Have  mercy  upon 
me,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  goodness.  Then  the  Priest  and  Deacon 
stand  before  the  Altar,  and  make  three  reverences,  saying: 

O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner. 

The  Priest,  elevating  his  hands,  saith  in  a  low  voice:  Let  us,  the  Cherubim  mys- 
tically representing  now  lay  aside.  (Thrice.)  (See  page  94.)  Then 
each  finisheth  the  Hymn:  That  we  may  raise  on  high  A  nd  they  kiss  the 
Altar,  and  go  to  the  Chapel  of  Oblation,  which  the  Priest  censeth. 

If  it  be  a  Pontifical  Service,  the  Bishop  taketh  out  the  particles  at  the  Table      Bish 
of  Oblation,  making  mention  of  the  living,  and  the  dead,  and  his  fellow- 
clergy,  saying:  Remember,  O  Lord,  thy  servant,  N.,  at  each  name,  and  end- 
ing: Remember  also,  O  Lord,  me,  thine  unworthy  servant,  N. 

Then  shall  the  Deacon  say  to  the  Priest: 
Take  up,  Master. 

And  the  Priest,  taking  the  air  (vozdukh),  shall  lay  it  on  the  Deacon's  left  shoulder, 
and  shall  say: 

Lift  up  your  hands  unto  the  Holy  Things  in  peace,  and  bless  the 
Lord. 

Then  taking  the  holy  paten  (diskos),  in  like  manner,  he  shall  set  it  on  the  head  of 
the  Deacon,  with  all  reverence,  the  Deacon  holding  the  censer  the  while  on  one 
of  his  fingers.     But  the  Priest  himself  shall  take  in  his  hand  the  holy  chalice 
(potir),  and  they  shall  go  forth  through  the  north  door,  preceded  by  a  taper,  and  shall 
stand  facing  the  People.     (But  the  Bishop  remaineth  in  the  Sanctuary.)

And  all  Clergy  enter  the  Sanctuary. 

The  Bishop  shall  set  the  holy  chalice  upon  the  Holy 
Altar,  saying: 

Noble  Joseph,  when  he  had  taken  thy  pure  Body  from  the  tree 
did  wrap  it  in  fine  linen  and  spices,  and  sorrowing  did  lay  it  in  a  new 
sepulchre. 

In  the  Grave  with  the  body,  but  in  Hell  with  the  soul,  in  that  thou 
art  God;  in  Paradise  with  the  thief,  and  on  the  throne  with  the 
Father  and  the  Spirit,  wast  thou,  O  Christ,  filling  all  things,  in  that 
thou  art  infinite. 

How  life-giving,  how  than  Paradise  more  fair  and,  of  a  truth, 
more  splendid  than  any  king's  chamber,  O  Christ,  is  shown  forth  thy 
tomb,  the  fountain  of  our  resurrection. 

Then  shall  he  take  the  veils  from  the  holy  paten  and  the  holy  chalice,  and  shall 
lay  them  on  one  side  of  the  Holy  Altar;  and  having  taken  the  air  from  the 
Deacon's  shoulder,  and  censed  it,  he  shall  cover  therewith  the  Holy  Gifts,  and 
shall  say: 

Noble  Joseph,  when  he  had  taken  thy  pure  Body  from  the  tree, 
did  wrap  it  in  fine  linen  and  spices,  and  sorrowing  did  lay  it  in  a  new 
sepulchre. 

Then  taking  the  censer  from  the  hands  of  the  Deacon,  he  shall  thrice  cense  the 
Holy  Gifts,  saying: 

Exalt  thou  Zion  by  thy  favour,  O  Lord,  and  let  the  walls  of  Jeru- 
salem be  built.  Then  shalt  thou  be  pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of 
righteousness,  with  sacrifices  and  burnt-offerings;  then  shall  they 
offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine  altar. 

Then  he  shall  give  the  censer  to  the 


censer

head, 


Deacon,    and   shall

Remember  me,  O  brother,  and

fingers  of  his  right  hand,  shall  say 
to  the  Priest: 
Pray  for  me,  holy  Master.

first  the  top  of  the  holy  paten, 
and  likewise  the  top  of  the 
holy  chalice,  and  the  edge  of 
the  Holy  Altar  before  him. 
If  there  be  several  Priests, 
they  shall  both  kiss  all  the 
Holy  Things,  and  each  other 
on  the  shoulder. 

And  if  a  Bishop  be  the  cele- 
brant, he  saith,  secretly,  as  he 
kisseth  the  paten:  0  Holy 
God;  and  the  holy  chalice: 
O  Holy  Mighty;  and  the  Holy 
Altar:  O  Holy  Immortal 
One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Then  the  Bishop  or  Priest  shall 
say: 

Christ  is  in  the  midst  of  us. 

And  having  been  kissed  on  the 
shoulder  and  on  the  hand,  he 
is  answered: 

He  is  and  shall  be. 

The  Priest  shall  fan  the  Holy 
Elements  with  the  air  If 
several  Priests  take  part  in 
the  service,  they  shall  all  fan 
the  Holy  Elements  with  the 
air,  in  like  manner,  and 
shall  repeat,  as  do  the  Peo- 
ple also,  the  Symbol  of  the 
Faith. 

Then  the  Priest  shall  take  the 
air  from  the  Holy  Elements, 
and  having  kissed  it,  he  shall 
lay  it  aside.

The  {Bishop)  Priest  shall  offer 
this  Prayer,  secretly. 

It  is  meet  and  right  that 
we  should  laud  thee,  bless 
thee,  praise  thee,  give 
thanks  unto  thee,  and  adore  thee  in  all  places  of  thy  dominion :  for  thou 
art  God  ineffable,  incomprehensible,  invisible,  inconceivable;  thou  art 
from  everlasting  and  art  changeless,  thou,  and  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  and  thy  Holy  Spirit.  Thou  from  nothingness  hast  called  us  into 
being;  and  when  we  had  fallen  away  from  thee,  thou  didst  raise  us  up 
again;  and  thou  hast  not  ceased  to  do  all  things  until  thou  hadst 
brought  us  back  to  heaven,  and  hadst  endowed  us  with  thy  kingdom 
which  is  to  come.  For  all  which  things  we  give  thanks  unto  thee,  and 
thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thy  Holy  Spirit;  for  all  the  things 
whereof  we  know,  and  whereof  we  know  not;  for  all  thy  benefits 
bestowed  upon  us,  both  manifest  and  unseen.  And  we  render  thanks 
unto  thee  for  this  ministry  which  thou  dost  deign  to  accept  at  our 
hands,  although  before  thee  stand  thousands  of  Archangels  and 
myriads  of  Angels,  with  the  Cherubim,  and  Seraphim,  six-winged, 
many-eyed,  who  soar  aloft,  borne  on  their  pinions. 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  used,  this  Prayer: 
O  thou  who  in  verity  existest,  Master,  Lord  God,  Father  Almighty 
adorable :  Meet  is  it,  in  truth,  and  just  and  befitting  the  majesty  of  thy 
holiness,  that  we  should  magnify  thee,  praise  thee,  bless  thee,  adore 
thee,  give  thanks  unto  thee  and  glorify  thee,  the  only  God  which 
verily  existeth,  and  offer  unto  thee,  with  contrite  heart  and  hum- 
bleness of  spirit,  this  our  reasonable  service:  for  it  is  thou  who  hast 
graciously  bestowed  upon  us  the  knowledge  of  thy  truth.  And  who 
hath  power  enough  to  express  thy  mighty  acts,  to  make  all  thy 
praises  to  be  heard,  or  to  utter  forth  all  thy  wonders  at  all  times?  O 
Master,  O  Sovereign  Master  of  all  things,  Lord  of  heaven  and  earth, 
and  of  all  created  beings  both  visible  and  invisible ;  who  sittest  on  the 
throne  of  glory  and  beholdest  the  depths;  who  art  from  everlasting, 
invisible,  inscrutable,  ineffable,  immutable,  the  Father  of  our  Lord 
Jesus  Christ,  our  great  God  and  the  Saviour,  our  hope,  who  is  the

Priest.  Singing  the 
triumphant  song,  cry- 
ing, calling  aloud,  and 
saying : 

Choir.  Holy,  holy, 
holy,  Lord  of  Sab-

in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord.  Hosanna  in  the

The  Deacon  now  taking  the  holy  star-cover  from  the 
holy  paten,  shall  make  the  sign  of  the  cross  above 
it,  and  shall  kiss  it,  and  lay  it  on  one  side.  He 
shall  then  go  and  stand  on  the  right  of  the  Holy 
Altar. 

The  Priest  prayeth,  secretly. 

And  we  also,  O  Lord  who  lovest  man- 
kind, in  company  with  these  blessed  Powers 
do  cry  aloud  and  say:  Holy  art  thou,  and 
all-holy  thou,  and  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  and  thy  Holy  Spirit;  holy  and  all- 
holy;  and  majestic  is  thy  glory.  Who  hast  so 
loved  thy  world  that  thou  gavest  thine  Only- 
begotten  Son,  that  whosoever  believeth  on 
him  should  not  perish,  but  should  have  ever- 
lasting life;  who,  when  he  had  come  and 
had  performed  all  the  dispensation  for  us,  in 
the  night  in  which  he  was  given  up,  —  in  the 
which,  rather,  he  did  give  himself  for  the  life  of  the  world,  —  took 
bread  in  his  holy  and  pure  and  sinless  hands;  and  when  he  had  given 
thanks,  and  blessed  it,  and  so  sanctified  it,  he  gave  it  to  his  holy  dis- 
ciples and  apostles,  saying: 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  used,  this  Prayer: 
With  these  blessed  Powers,  O  Master  who  lovest  mankind,  we  sin- 
ners also  do  cry  aloud  and  say:  Holy  art  thou,  of  a  truth,  and  all- 
holy,  and  there  are  no  bounds  to  the  majesty  of  thy  holiness,  and  just 
art  thou  in  all  thy  works;  for  in  righteousness  and  true  judgment 
hast  thou  ordered  all  things  for  us.  When  thou  hadst  created  man, 
and  hadst  fashioned  him  from  the  dust  of  the  earth,  and  hadst  hon- 
oured him  with  thine  own  image,  O  God,  thou  didst  set  him  in  the 
midst  of  a  Paradise  of  plenty,  promising  him  life  eternal  and  the 
enjoyment  of  everlasting  good  things  in  keeping  thy  commandments.

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  103 

But  when  he  disobeyed  thee,  the  true  God,  who  had  created  him, 
and  was  led  astray  by  the  guile  of  the  serpent,  and  rendered  subject 
to  death  through  his  own  transgressions,  thou  didst  banish  him,  in 
thy  righteous  judgment,  O  God,  from  Paradise  into  this  present 
world,  and  didst  turn  him  again  to  the  earth  from  which  he  was 
taken,  providing  for  him  the  salvation  of  regeneration,  which  is  in  thy 
Christ  himself.  For  thou  didst  not  turn  thyself  away  forever  from 
thy  creature,  whom  thou  hadst  made,  O  Good  One,  neither  didst  thou 
forget  the  work  of  thy  hands;  but  thou  didst  visit  him  in  divers 
manners,  through  the  tender  compassion  of  thy  mercy.  Thou  didst 
send  forth  Prophets;  thou  didst  perform  mighty  works  by  the  Saints 
who,  in  every  generation,  were  well-pleasing  unto  thee;  thou  didst 
speak  to  us  by  the  mouths  of  thy  servants  the  Prophets,  who  fore- 
told unto  us  the  salvation  which  was  to  come;  thou  didst  give  us  the 
Law  to  aid  us;  thou  didst  appoint  guardian  Angels.  And  when  the 
fulness  of  time  was  come,  thou  didst  speak  unto  us  by  thy  Son  him- 
self, by  whom  also  thou  madest  the  ages;  who,  being  the  Brightness 
of  thy  glory,  and  the  Express  Image  of  thy  Person,  and  upholding  all 
things  by  the  word  of  his  power,  thought  it  no  robbery  to  be  equal  to 
thee,  the  God  and  Father.  But  albeit  he  was  God  before  all  the  ages, 
yet  he  appeared  upon  earth  and  dwelt  among  men ;  and  was  incarnate 
of  a  Holy  Virgin,  and  did  empty  himself,  taking  on  the  form  of  a 
servant,  and  becoming  conformed  to  the  fashion  of  our  lowliness,  that 
he  might  make  us  conformable  to  the  image  of  his  glory.  For  as  by 
man  sin  entered  into  the  world,  and  by  sin  death,  so  it  seemed  good 
unto  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  who  is  in  thy  bosom,  our  God  and 
Father,  to  be  born  of  a  woman,  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever- 
virgin  Mary;  to  be  born  under  the  Law,  that  he  might  condemn  sin  in 
his  flesh;  that  they  who  were  dead  in  Adam  might  be  made  alive  in 
thy  Christ.  And  becoming  a  dweller  in  this  world,  and  giving  com- 
mandments of  salvation,  he  released  us  from  the  delusions  of  idols, 
and  brought  us  unto  a  knowledge  of  thee,  the  true  God  and  Father, 
having  won  us  unto  himself  for  a  peculiar  people,  a  royal  priesthood, 
a  holy  nation ;.  and  being  purified  with  water,  and  sanctified  with  the 
Holy  Spirit,  he  gave  himself  a  ransom  to  Death,  whereby  we  were 
held,  sold  into  bondage  under  sin.  And  having  descended  into  Hell 
through  the  Cross,  that  he  might  fill  all  things  with  himself,  he  loosed 
the  pains  of  death,  and  rose  again  from  the  dead  on  the  third  day, 
making  a  way  for  all  flesh  through  the  Resurrection  from  the  dead  — 
for  it  was  not  possible  that  the  Author  of  Life  should  be  holden  of 
corruption  —  that  he  might  be  the  first-fruits  of  those  who  have 
fallen  asleep,  the  first-born  from  the  dead;  and  he  shall  be  all  things, 
the  first  in  all  things.  And  ascending  into  heaven,  he  sat  down  at  the 
right  hand  of  thy  Majesty  on  high;  and  he  shall  come  again  to  render

unto  every  man  according  to  his  works.  And  he  hath  left  with  us,  as 
memorials  of  his  saving  Passion,  these  Things  which  we  have  spread 
forth  according  to  his  commandment.  For  when  he  was  about  to  go 
forth  to  his  voluntary,  and  ever-memorable,  and  life-creating  death, 
in  the  night  in  which  he  gave  himself  for  the  life  of  the  world,  he  took 
bread  in  his  holy  and  stainless  hands,  and  when  he  had  shown  it  unto 
thee,  his  God  and  Father,  he  gave  thanks,  blessing  it,  sanctifying  it, 
and  breaking  it,  he  gave  it  to  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles,  saying:] 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  Take,  eat,  this  is  my  Body  which  is  broken  for  you,  for  the  re 

mission  of  sins. 

Choir.     Amen. 

As  he  saith  this,  the  Deacon  shall  point  out  the  holy  paten  to  the  Priest,  holding 
his  stole  with  three  fingers  of  his  right  hand. 

Priest.  And  in  like  manner,  after  supper  he  took  the  cup,  saying: 
As  he  saith  this,  the  Deacon  pointeth  to  the  holy  chalice.

In  like  manner,  having  taken  the  cup  of  the  fruit  of  the  vine,  and

He  gave  it  to  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles,  saying:]

Priest.  Drink  ye  all  of  this :  for  this  is  my  Blood  of  the  New  Testament, 
which  is  shed  for  you,  and  for  many,  for  the  remission  of  sins. 
Choir.  Amen. 

The  Priest,  secretly. 
Bearing  in  remembrance,  therefore,  this  commandment  of  salva- 
tion, and  all  those  things  which  came  to  pass  for  us;  the  Cross,  the 
Grave,  the  Resurrection  on  the  third  day,  the  Ascension  into  Heaven,

Exclamation. 
Priest.  Thine  own,  of  thine  own,  we  offer  unto  thee,  in  behalf  of  all,  and 
for  all. 

Here  the  Deacon,  crossing  his  hands,  shall  lift  up  the  holy  paten  and  the  holy  chalice, 
and  making  with  them  the  sign  of  the  cross,  he  shall  himself  make  a  humble  rever- 
ence. 


Choir.  We  praise 
thee,  we  bless  thee, 
we  give  thanks  unto 
thee,  O  Lord,  and  we 
pray  unto  thee,  O 
our  God. 


The  Priest  prayeth,  secretly. 
Again  we  offer  unto  thee  this  reasonable 
and  unbloody  service.  And  we  beseech  and 
implore  thee,  and  offer  our  supplications 
unto  thee,  that  thou  wilt  send  thy  Holy 
Spirit  upon  us,  and  upon  these  Gifts  here 
spread  forth. 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  used: 
Wherefore,  O  all-holy  Master,  we  also,  thy  sinful  and  unworthy 
servants,  whom  thou  hast  graciously  permitted  to  minister  at  thy 
holy  Altar,  not  through  our  own  righteousness  (for  we  have  done 
no  good  deed  on  earth),  but  because  of  thy  mercies  and  bounties, 
which  thou  hast  richly  poured  out  upon  us,  now  have  boldness  to 
draw  near  unto  this,  thy  holy  Altar;  and  presenting  unto  thee  the 
holy  emblems  of  the  sacred  Body  and  Blood  of  thy  Christ,  we  pray 
thee  and  implore  thee,  O  Holy  of  Holies,  by  the  favour  of  thy  goodness, 
that  thy  Holy  Spirit  may  descend  upon  us,  and  upon  these  Gifts  here 
spread  forth  before  thee,  and  bless  them,  and  sanctify  and  manifest 
them.] 

Then  the  Deacon  shall  approach  the  Priest;  and  standing  side  by  side,  they  shall 
both  make  three  lowly  reverences  before  the  Holy  Altar,  praying  silently  thus: 

Priest.  O  Lord,  who  at  the  Third  Hour  didst  send  down  upon 
thine  Apostles  thy  Holy  Spirit:  Take  not  the  same  from  us,  O  Good 
One,  but  renew  Him  in  us  who  make  our  supplications  unto  thee. 

Deacon.  Make  me  a  dean  heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit 
within  me. 

Priest.  O  Lord,  who  at  the  Third  Hour  .  . 

Deacon.  Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy 
Holy  Spirit  from  me. 

Priest.  O  Lord,  who  at  the  Third  Hour 

Then  the  Deacon,  bowing  his  head  and  pointing  with  his  stole  to  the  Holy  Bread, 
shall  say: 

Bless,  Master,  the  Holy  Bread. 

And  the  Priest,  standing  erect,  shall  sign  the  Holy  Bread  with  the  sign  of  the 
cross,  and  shall  say: 

And  make  this  bread  the  precious  Body  of  thy  Christ.

Deacon.  Amen.     Bless,  Master,  the  holy  chalice. 

And  the  Priest  shall  bless  it,  and  shall  say:

Deacon.  Amen. 

And  again,  the  Deacon,  pointing  to  both  the  Holy  Elements,  shall  say: 

Master,  bless  both. 

And  the  Priest,  blessing  both,  shall  say:

And  if  a  Priest  hath  been  ordained  at  this  same  Liturgy,  the  Bishop  now  biddeth 
him  to  draw  near,  and  taking  the  Holy  Bread,  and  breaking  the  portion  XC

And  the  Deacon  shall  cense  the  Holy  Altar  round  about,  and  shall  make  mention 
of  the  living  and  of  the  dead.

the  word  of  thy  truth;  all  the  Priesthood,  the 
Diaconate  in  Christ,  and  every  order  of  the 
Clergy. 

Furthermore  we  offer  unto  thee  this  our 
reasonable  worship  on  behalf  of  the  whole 
universe;  of  the  Holy  Catholic  and  Apostolic 
Church;  of  those  who  continue  in  chastity 
and  soberness  of  life;  of  our  most  God-fear- 
ing Ruler,  N.;  and  all  the  Authorities,  and 
all  their  Council  and  Army  and  Navy. 
Grant  unto  them,  O  Lord,  a  peaceful  reign, 
and  that  we,  through  their  tranquillity,  may 
pass  our  time  in  rest  and  quietness,  in  all 
godliness  and  soberness  of  life.

Angels,  and  all  man-

Temple  and  super- 
sensual  Paradise, 
Glory  of  Virgins,  of 
whom  God,  who  is 
our  God  before  all  the 
ages,  was  incarnate 
and  became  a  little 
child.  For  he  made 
of  thy  womb  a  throne, 
and  thy  belly  did  he 
make  more  spacious 
than  the  heavens.  In 
thee  doth  all  Crea- 
tion rejoice,  O  thou 
who  art  full  of  Glory : 
Glory  to  thee. 

Or,  at  the  different 
Feasts,  there  shall  be 
sung  the  appointed 
Hymn  to  the  Birth-

And  give  them  rest  where  the  light  of  thy 
countenance  shall  visit  them. 

Have  in  remembrance,  also,  O  Lord,  we 
beseech  thee,  thy  Holy  Catholic  and  Apos- 
tolic Church,  which  is  from  end  to  end  of  the 
Universe;  and  give  peace  unto  Her  whom 
thou  hast  purchased  with  the  precious  Blood 
of  thy  Christ:  and  establish  thou  firmly  this 
holy  Temple,  even  unto  the  end  of  the 
world.  Remember,  O  Lord,  those  who  have 
offered  unto  thee  these  Gifts;  and  those 
for  whom,  and  by  whom,  and  in  behalf  of 
whom  they  have  offered  them. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  those 
who  bear  fruit  and  do  good  works  in  thy 
holy  churches,  and  those  who  are  mindful  of 
the  poor.  Requite  them  with  thy  rich  and 
heavenly  gifts.  Give  them  things  heavenly 
for  things  earthly;  things  eternal  for  things 
temporal;  things  incorruptible  for  things 
corruptible. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  those  who 
are  in  the  deserts,  and  mountains,  and  cav- 
erns, and  in  the  subterranean  pits  of  the 
earth. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  all  those 
who  continue  in  virginity  and  godliness, 
and  in  asceticism  and  devoutness  of  life. 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  109 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  our  most  God-fearing  and  Christ-lov- 
ing Ruler,  N.,  to  whom  thou  hast  given  the  right  to  reign  in  the  earth. 
Crown  him  with  the  armour  of  truth,  with  the  panoply  of  contentment. 
Overshadow  his  head  in  the  day  of  battle.  Strengthen  his  arm,  exalt 
his  right  hand ;  make  mighty  his  kingdom ;  subdue  under  him  all  bar- 
barous nations  which  seek  wars;  grant  unto  him  peace  profound  and 
inviolate;  inspire  his  heart  with  good  deeds  toward  thy  Church,  and 
toward  all  thy  people ;  that  through  his  serenity  we  may  lead  a  quiet 
and  tranquil  life,  in  all  godliness  and  soberness. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  all  Rulers  and  Authorities,  as  also 
our  brethren  who  are  in  their  Council;  and  all  their  Army  and  Navy 
In  their  goodness,  preserve  thou  the  good,  and  through  thine  own 
goodness  make  thou  the  evil  good. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  this  congregation  here  present,  and 
those  who  are  absent  for  reasonable  cause;  and  have  mercy  upon 
them  and  upon  us,  according  to  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies.  Fill 
their  treasuries  with  every  good  thing;  maintain  their  marriage-bond 
in  peace  and  concord;  rear  the  infants;  guide  the  young;  support  the 
aged;  'encourage  the  faint-hearted.  Collect  the  scattered,  and  turn 
them  from  their  wandering  astray,  and  unite  them  to  thy  Holy  Cath- 
olic and  Apostolic  Church.  Set  at  liberty  those  who  are  vexed  by  un- 
clean spirits;  voyage  with  those  who  voyage,  journey  with  those  who 
journey;  defend  the  widows;  protect  the  orphans;  free  the  captives; 
heal  the  sick.  Have  in  remembrance,  O  God,  those  who  are  under 
trial,  and  in  the  mines,  and  in  prison,  and  in  bitter  labors,  and  in  all 
affliction,  distress  and  tribulation. 

Have  in  remembrance,  O  God,  all  those  who  invoke  thy  great 
loving-kindness;  those  also  who  love  us,  and  those  who  hate  us,  and 
those  who  have  enjoined  us,  unworthy  though  we  are,  that  we  should 
pray  for  them ;  and  all  thy  people,  O  Lord  our  God :  And  upon  them 
all  pour  out  thy  rich  mercy,  granting  unto  all  such  of  their  petitions 
as  are  unto  salvation.  And  those  whom  we,  through  ignorance,  or 
forgetfulness,  or  the  multitude  of  names,  have  not  remembered,  do 
thou  thyself  call  to  mind,  O  God,  who  knowest  the  age  and  the  name 
of  each,  and  knowest  every  man  even  from  his  mother's  womb.  For 
thou,  O  Lord,  art  the  Helper  of  the  helpless,  the  Hope  of  the  hopeless, 
the  Saviour  of  the  storm-tossed,  the  Haven  of  the  voyager,  the  Healer 
of  the  sick.  Be  thyself  all  things  unto  all  men,  O  thou  who  knowest 
every  man,  his  petition,  his  abode,  and  his  need.  Deliver,  O  Lord, 
this  city,  and  every  city  and  land  from  famine,  plague,  earthquake, 
flood,  fire,  sword,  the  invasion  of  enemies,  and  from  civil  war.]

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

When  the  portion  1ИС  hath  been  removed,  it  shall  be  placed  in  the  holy  chalice. 
The  portion  XC  shall  be  partaken  of  by  the  Clergy  who  take  part  in  the  Lit- 
urgy. The  two  other  portions,  namely,  the  N1  and  the  KA,  are  broken  for  the 
communion  of  the  laity.  And  from  the  portion  which  representeth  the  Holy 
Birth-giver  of  God,  or  from  the  particles  representing  the  nine  ranks  of  the 
Heavenly  Hierarchy ,  which  are  upon  the  holy  paten,  shall  no  one  be  communi- 
cated: but  only  from  the  two  portions  of  the  Holy  Lamb  which  remain  shall  the 
laity  be  communicated. 

Then  the  Deacon,  pointing  ivith  his  stole  to  the  holy  chalice,  shall  exclaim: 

Fill,  Master,  the  holy  chalice. 

And  the  Priest,  taking  the  portion  1ИС from  the  place  where  it  lieth,  shall  make 
therewith  the  sign  of  the  cross  above  the  holy  chalice,  saying: 

The  fulness  of  the  Holy  Spirit:  {and  shall  place  it  in  the  holy  chalice) . 
Deacon.  Amen.  (21) 

And  taking  the  warm  water,  he  shall  say  to  the  Priest: 
Bless,  Master,  the  warm  water. 

And  the  Priest  shall  bless  it,  saying: 
Blessed  is  the  fervour  of  thy  Saints  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Deacon  shall  pour  into  the  holy  chalice,  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  what  is 
required,  saying: 

The  warmth  of  faith,  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

When  the  divine  Blood  of  the  Lord  is  mingled  with  the  holy  warm  water,  it  must 
be  done  ivith  heed,  and  in  amount  according  to  the  number  of  those  who  desire  to 
receive  the  Holy  Sacrament.

The  Priest  breaketh  the  portion  XC 
into  a  number  of  pieces,  correspond- 
ing to  the  number  of  Clergy  who  take 
part  in  the  Liturgy. 

Then  the  Priest  saith: 

Deacon,  draw  near. 

And  the  Deacon  shall  approach,  and 
shall  make  a  devout  reverence,  en- 
treating forgiveness;  and  having 
kissed  the  Altar,  he  shall  say: 

Lo,  I  draw  near  unto  the  King 
Immortal  and  our  God. 

Impart  unto  me,  Master,  the 
precious  and  holy  Body  of  our 
Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour, 
Jesus  Christ. 

And  the  Priest  shall  give  him  a  por- 
tion of  the  Holy  Body,  and  shall  say:

When  a  Bishop  is  the  celebrant,  he 
divideth  the  portion  XC,  and  hav- 
ing prayed:  I  believe,  0  Lord,  and 
I  confess,  that  thou  art,  in  very 
truth,  the  Christ,  the  Son  of  the 
living  God :  he  consumeth  part 
of  the  portion  XC,  saying:

most  pure  Body  of  our  Lord,  and 
God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,

precious,   and  holy,  and   all-pure 

Body  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and 

Saviour,   Jesus    Christ,    unto   the 

remission   of  his   sins,   and    unto 

life  everlasting. 

And  the  Deacon  shall  kiss  the  Priest's 

hand  as  he  taketh  the  Holy  Body, 

and  shall  withdraw  behind  the  Holy 

Altar;  and  bowing  his  head  over  the 

Holy  Altar,  he  shall  pray  like  the 

Priest: 

I  believe,  O  Lord,  and  I  con- 
fess, that  thou  art,  in  very  truth, 
the  Christ,  the  Son  of  the  living 
God:  .  .  . 

All  the  Priests,  in  the  order  of  their 
seniority,  first  make  an  obeisance 
to  each  other,  and  to  the  People; 
and  having  besought  forgiveness: 
Forgive  me,  fathers  and  brethren: 
and  kissed  the  side  of  the  Altar,  they 
say: 

Lo,  I  draw  near  unto  the  King 
Immortal,  and  to  God. 

The  precious  and  all-holy  Body 
of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Sa- 
viour, Jesus  Christ,  is  imparted 
to  me,  N.,  Priest,  unto  the  re- 
mission of  my  sins,  and  unto  life 
everlasting. 

Then  each  taketh  a  piece  of  the  Holy 
Body,  and  bowing  low  over  the  Holy 
Altar,  and  gazing  devoutly  upon  the 
Holy  Body  of  Christ,  they  say  pri- 
vately, each  to  himself: 

I  believe,  O  Lord,  and  I  con- 
fess, that  thou  art,  in  very  truth, 
the  Christ,  the  Son  of  the  living 
God,  who  didst  come  into  the 
world  to  save  sinners,  of  whom 
I  am  chief.  And  I  believe  that 
this  is,  of  a  truth,  thine  all-pure 
Body,  and  that  this  is  thine  own 
precious  Blood.  Wherefore,  I  be- 
seech thee,  have  mercy  upon  me, 
and    forgive    my    transgressions, 


Then,  taking  the  sponge,  he  wipeth 
his  hand;  and  having  kissed  the 
sponge,  he  layeth  it  aside.  Then, 
taking  the  holy  veil  and  the  chalice 
with  both  hands,  he  communicateth 
himself  therefrom  thrice,  saying: 

The  precious,  and  holy,  and 
life-giving  Blood  of  our  Lord, 
and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus 
Christ,  is  imparted  to  me,  the 
unworthy,  N.,  Bishop,  unto  the 
remission  of  my  sins,  and  unto 
life  everlasting.  (In  the  Name 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son, 
and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  Amen.) 

Then  he  wipeth  his  lips  and  the  chal- 
ice with  the  veil  which  is  in  his 
hand,  saying: 

Lo,  this  hath  touched  my  lips, 
and  shall  take  away  mine  ini- 
quities, and  shall  purge  away  my 
sins. 

Then  kissing  the  holy  chalice,  he  saith: 

Glory  to  thee,  O  God.  {Thrice.)

Then  the  other  Clergy  approach  the 
Bishop  in  the  order  of  their  senior- 
ity and  kiss  the  edge  of  the  Altar, 
and  having  said: 

Lo,  I  draw  near  unto  the 
King  Immortal  and  our  God.

and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ: 

Each  receiveth  from  him  a  portion  of 
the  Holy  Body,  the  Bishop  saying 
to  each: 

To  thee,  Priest  {or  Deacon,  or 
as  his  rank  may  be),  is  imparted

immortal  Body  of  our  Lord,  and 
God,  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ, 
unto  the  remission  of  thy  sins, 
and  unto  life  everlasting.  (In 
the  name  of  the  Father,  and  of 
the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen.) 

And  they  kiss  the  hand  and  the  shoul- 
der of  the  Bishop;  and  to  his  greet- 
ing: 

Christ  is  in  the  midst  of  us, 

They  reply: 

He  is,  and  shall  be. 

Then  he  giveth  to  each  of  them  thrice 
the  holy  chalice,  saying: 

Lo,  this  hath  touched  thy  lips, 
and  shall  take  away  thine  iniqui- 
ties, and  shall  purge  away  thy 
sins. 

And  he  saith  the  Prayer  of  Thanksgiv- 
ing.    (See  page  118.) 

And  so  shall  they  partake  of  the  Holy  Body  which  they  hold  in  their  hands,  with 

awe,  and  all  godly  fear. 
And  when  they  have  partaken  thereof,  the  Priests  partake,  in  due  order,  of  the 

Holy  Blood  from  the  chalice,  thrice,  saying: 

The  precious  and  holy  Blood  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour, 
Jesus  Christ,  is  imparted  to  me,  the  servant  of  God,  Priest,  N.,  unto 
the  remission  of  my  sins,  and  unto  life  everlasting. 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit.     Amen. 

Sometimes:  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have 
mercy  upon  us . 

Then  having  wiped  his  mouth  and  the  holy  chalice  with  the  veil,  which  he  holdeth 
in  his  hand,  the  Priest  shall  say: 

Lo,  this  hath  touched  my  lips,  and  shall  take  away  mine  iniquities, 
and  shall  purge  away  my  sins. 

Then  the  Senior  Priest  saith  again: 

Deacon,  draw  near. 

And  the  Deacon  shall  approach,  and  shall  make  one  reverence,  saying: 
Lo,  I  draw  near  unto  the  King  Immortal,  and  our  God. 
Impart  unto  me,  Master,  the  precious  and  holy  Blood  of  our  Lord 
and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ. 


whether  voluntary  or  involun- 
tary; whether  of  word  or  of 
deed;  whether  committed  with 
knowledge  or  in  ignorance.  And 
vouchsafe  that  I  may  partake 
without  condemnation  of  thine 
all-pure  Mysteries,  unto  the  re- 
mission of  my  sins,  and  unto  life 
eternal.     Amen. 

Of  thy  Mystical  Supper,  O  Son 
of  God,  accept  me  to-day  as  a 
communicant:  for  I  will  not  speak 
of  thy  Mystery  to  thine  enemies, 
neither,  like  Judas,  will  I  give  thee 
a  kiss;  but  like  the  thief  will  I 
confess  thee:  Remember  me,  O 
Lord,  in  thy  kingdom. 

And  let  not  this  participation 
in  thy  Holy  Mysteries  be  unto 
judgment  upon  me,  or  unto  con- 
demnation, O  Lord,  but  unto  the 
healing  of  soul  and  body. 


nS  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

And  the  Priest,  giving  him  the  chalice,  shall  say: 
The  servant  of  God,  N.,  Deacon,  partaketh  of  the  precious  and 
all-holy  Blood  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,  unto 
the  remission  of  his  sins,  and  unto  life  everlasting. 

And  having  communicated  the  Deacon,  the  Priest  shall  say: 
Lo,  this  hath  touched  thy  lips,  and  shall  take  away  thine  iniquities, 
and  shall  purge  away  thy  sins. 

If  there  be  any  who  desire  to  partake  of  the  Holy  Mysteries,  the  Priest  shall  divide 
the  remaining  portions,  the  N1  and  the  KA,  into  small  particles,  sufficient  for 
all,  and  place  them  in  the  chalice. 
Then  the  Deacon,  setting  the  holy  paten  above  the  holy  chalice,  saith  these  Hymns 
of  the  Resurrection: 

In  that  we  have  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  Christ,  let  us  bow 
down  before  the  holy  Lord  Jesus,  the  only  sinless  One.  Thy  Cross 
do  we  adore,  O  Christ,  and  thy  holy  Resurrection  we  laud  and 
glorify:  for  thou  art  our  God,  and  we  know  none  other  beside  thee;  we 
call  upon  thy  Name.  O  come,  all  ye  faithful,  let  us  adore  Christ's 
holy  Resurrection.  For  lo,  through  the  Cross  is  joy  come  into  all  the 
world.  Ever  blessing  the  Lord,  let  us  sing  his  Resurrection:  for  in 
that  he  endured  the  Cross  he  hath  destroyed  Death  by  death. 

Shine,  shine,  O  new  Jerusalem,  for  the  glory  of  the  Lord  is  risen 
upon  thee!  Shout  now  and  be  glad,  O  Zion!  And  do  thou,  O  Pure 
One,  Birth-giver  of  God,  rejoice  in  the  Rising-again  of  him  whom 
thou  didst  bear. 

O  Christ,  Passover  great  and  most  Holy!  O  Wisdom,  Word,  and 
Power  of  God!  Vouchsafe  that  we  may  more  perfectly  partake  of 
thee  in  the  days  which  know  no  evening  of  thy  kingdom. 

While  with  the  sponge  he  wipeth  all  the  particles  into  the  chalice  with  all  care 
and  reverence,  he  saith: 

Wash  away,  O  Lord,  the  sins  of  all  who  are  here  commemorated, 
by  thy  precious  Blood,  through  the  prayers  of  thy  Saints. 

And  he  shall  cover  the  holy  chalice  with  the  veil;  and  in  like  manner  he  shall  cover 
the  holy  paten  with  the  star-cover  and  the  veil.     Then  the  Priest  shall  recite  the 

Prayer  of  Thanksgiving,  secretly. 
We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  who  lovest  mankind,  Bene- 
factor of  our  souls  and  bodies,  for  that  thou  hast  vouchsafed  this  day 
to  feed  us  with  thy  heavenly  and  immortal  Mysteries.  Guide  our 
path  aright;  stablish  us  all  in  thy  fear;  guard  our  life;  make  sure  our 
steps:  through  the  prayers  and  supplications  of  the  glorious  Birth- 
giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  and  of  all  thy  Saints. 

[Or,  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  used,  this  Prayer: 
We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  Lord  our  God,  for  the  participation 


Ob 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  119 

in  thy  holy,  pure,  immortal  and  heavenly  Mysteries,  which  thou  hast 
given  unto  us  for  the  welfare  and  sanctification  and  healing  of  our 
souls  and  bodies.  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord  of  all,  grant  that  the 
communion  of  the  holy  Body  and  Blood  of  thy  Christ  may  be  for  us 
unto  faith  which  cannot  be  put  to  confusion,  unto  love  unfeigned, 
unto  increase  of  wisdom,  unto  the  healing  of  soul  and  body,  unto  the 
turning  aside  of  every  adversary,  unto  the  fulfilment  of  thy  com- 
mandments, unto  an  acceptable  defence  at  the  dread  Judgment 
Seat  of  thy  Christ.] 

Then  the  Holy  Door  is  opened,  and  the  Deacon,  making  a  reverence,  shall  approach 
the  Holy  Door;  and  he  taketh  from  the  Bishop  or  the  Priest  the  holy  chalice,  and 
elevating  it,  he  saith: 

In  the  fear  of  God  and  with  faith  draw  near. 

Choir.  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord;  God  is  the 
Lord  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us. 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,   Easter- 
and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

Those  who  desire  to  communicate  shall  then  approach.  They  shall  come  singly,, 
and  shall  do  reverence,  with  all  devoutness  and  awe,  with  their  hands  crossed  on 
their  breasts:  and  in  this  manner  shall  they  receive  the  Holy  Mysteries,  alter 
the  Priest  hath  said  aloud  the  Prayer: 

I  believe,  O  Lord,  and  I  confess,  .  .  .  (See  page  116.) 

And  as  he  communicateth  each  one,  the  Priest  shall  say: 
The  servant  of  God,  N.,  partaketh  of  the- precious  and  holy  Body 
and  Blood  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,  unto  the 
remission  of  his  (or  her)  sins,  and  unto  life  everlasting.  (22) 

And  as  each  person  is  communicated,  the  Choir  singeth: 
Receive  ye  the  Body  of  Christ;  taste  ye  of  the  Fountain  of  Life. 

Then  the  communicant's  mouth  shall  be  wiped  with  the  holy  veil,  and  he  shall 
kiss  the  holy  chalice,  and  making  a  reverence,  he  shall  go  aside  where  he  is 
given  the  antidoron  and  the  holy  warm  water. 

And  when  all  have  finished,  the  Choir  singeth: 
Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia. 
And' the  Priest  shall  set  the  chalice  on  the  Altar,  and  shall  bless  the  People,  saying: 
O  God,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance.

I20  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

Choir.  We  have  beheld  the 
true  Light;  we  have  received  the 
heavenly  Spirit;  we  have  found 
the  true  faith.  Let  us  bow  down 
in  worship  to  the  Trinity  Undi- 
vided, for  He  hath  saved  us. 
Or,  at  Eastertide: 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead, 
trampling  down  Death  by  death, 
and  upon  those  in  the  tomb 
bestowing  life. 


Then  the  Priest  and  the  Deacon  shall 
turn  to  the  Holy  Altar;  and  the 
Priest  shall  cense  it,  saying  thrice, 
to  himself:  Bishop. 


Be  thou  exalted  in  heaven,  O 
God,  and  thy  glory  above  all  the 
earth. 

The   Priest,    taking   the    holy    paten, 
shall  then  set  it  upon  the  head  of  the 
Deacon;  and  the  Deacon,  holding  it 
reverently,  shall  go  to  the  Table  of 
Oblation,  and  set  it  down  there. 
The  Priest,  having  done  reverence  also,  shall  take  the  holy  chalice  (from  the 
Bishop,  if  it  be  a  Pontifical  Service);  and  turning  to  face  the  Holy  Door,  he 
shall  look  upon  the  People,  while  he  saith,  secretly:  (23) 

Blessed  is  our  God ! 

Then,  aloud:  Always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Let  our  mouths  be  filled  with  thy  praise,  O  Lord,  that  we  may  extol 
thy  glory,  for  that  thou  hast  deigned  to  make  us  partakers  of  thy  holy, 
divine,  immortal  and  life-giving  Mysteries.  Establish  us  in  thy  Sancti- 
fication,  that  all  the  day  long  we  may  meditate  upon  thy  righteousness. 
Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia. 

Easter-     Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death, 
and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

And  the  Deacon,  coming  forth  through  the  north  door,  and  standing  in  his  accustomed 
place,  saith: 

Having  received  the  divine,  holy,  pure,  immortal,  heavenly,  life-giving 
and  terrible  Mysteries  of  Christ,  O  believers,  let  us  worthily  give  thanks 
unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Beseeching  that  this  whole  day  may  be  perfect,  holy,  peaceful  and  sin- 
less, let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto  Christ 
our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest,  folding  the  corporal  (antimins),  shall  make  over  it,  with  the  book  of 
the  Holy  Gospels,  the  sign  of  the  cross. 

Exclamation. 
Priest.  For  thou  art  our  sanctification,  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory, 
to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Let  us  depart  in  peace. 

Choir.  In  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Then  the  Junior  Priest  cometh  forth,  and,  standing  at  the  foot  of  the  Tribune,  readeth 
the  Prayer  before  the  Tribune. 

O  Lord,  who  blessest  those  who  bless  thee,  and  sanctifiest  those  who 
put  their  trust  in  thee :  Save  thy  people  and  bless  thine  inheritance.  Pre- 
serve the  fulness  of  thy  Church;  sanctify  those  who  love  the  beauty  of  thy 
house;  glorify  them  in  recompense  with  thy  divine  might,  and  forsake  not 
us  who  set  our  hope  on  thee.  Give  peace  to  thy  world,  and  to  thy 
Churches,  and  to  thy  Priests:  and  to  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler  N.,  to 
the  Army  and  Navy,  and  to  all  thy  people.  For  every  good  gift  and  every 
perfect  gift  is  from  above,  and  cometh  from  thee,  the  Father  of  Lights. 
And  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory,  and  thanksgiving,  and  worship,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. Blessed  be  the  Name  of  the  Lord  henceforth  and 

forever.     (Thrice.) 


Reader:  Psalm  xxxiv.  I  will 
alway  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord: 
Come,  ye  children,  and  hearken 
unto  me:  I  will  teach  you  the  fear 
of  the  Lord.  What  man  is  he  that 
lusteth  to  live,  and  would  fain  see 
good  days?  Keep  thy  tongue  from 
evil,  and  do  good:  seek  peace,  and 
ensue  it.  The  eyes  of  the  Lord  are 
over  the  righteous,  and  his  ears  are 
open  unto  their  prayers.  The  coun- 
tenance of  the  Lord  is  against  them 
that  do  evil,  to  root  out  the  remem- 
brance of  them  from  the  earth.  The 
righteous  cry,  and  the  Lord  heareth 
them,  and  delivereth  them  out  of  all 
their  troubles.  The  Lord  is  nigh 
unto  them  that  are  of  a  contrite 
heart,  and  will  save  such  as  be  of 
an  humble  spirit.  Great  are  the 
troubles  of  the  righteous,  but  the 
Lord  delivereth  him  out  of  all.  He 
keepeth  all  his  bones,  so  that  not  one 
of  them  is  broken.     But  misfortune 


The  Deacon  shall  stand  at  the  right  side 
of  the  image-screen  (ikonostds),  before 
the  holy  picture  (ikona)  of  our  Lord 
Christ,  holding  his  stole  in  his  hand, 
and  with  bowed  head,  until  the  conclu- 
sion of  the  Prayer  before  the

Oblation,  he  shall  say,  secredy,  the

And  the  Deacon,  entering  through 
the  north  door,  shall  consume  the

The  Priest  holdeth  the  cross  for  the  People  to  kiss,  and  distributed  the  antidoron  (24), 
after  which  he  withdraweth  to  the  Sanctuary,  and  the  Holy  Door  is  closed.  And  {if 
he  have  celebrated  without  a  Deacon)  the  Priest  consumeth  the  Holy  Gifts;  after 
which  he  reciteth  the  Post-Communion  Prayers. 

Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     {Thrice.) 

I  thank  thee,  O  Lord  my  God,  that  thou  hast  not  rejected  me,  a  sinner, 
but  hast  deemed  me  worthy  to  become  a  partaker  of  thy  Holy  Things.  I 
thank  thee  that  thou  hast  graciously  granted  unto  me,  though  unworthy, 
to  receive  thy  pure  and  heavenly  Gifts.  But,  O  Master  who  lovest  man- 
kind, who  for  our  sake  didst  die,  and  didst  rise  again,  and  hast  graciously 
bestowed  upon  us  these  terrible  and  life-giving  Mysteries,  for  the  benefit 
and  sanctification  of  our  souls  and  bodies:  Vouchsafe  that  they  may  be 
efficacious  for  me  also  unto  the  healing  of  my  soul  and  body,  unto  the 
averting  of  everything  contrary  thereto;  unto  the  enlightenment  of  the 
eyes  of  my  heart;  unto  the  peace  of  my  spiritual  powers;  unto  faith  in- 
vincible; unto  love  unfeigned;  unto  the  fulfilling  of  wisdom;  unto  the  keep- 
ing of  thy  commandments;  unto  the  increase  of  thy  divine  grace  and  the 
attainment  of  thy  kingdom :  that  by  them  preserved  in  thy  holiness  I  may 
ever  bear  in  mind  thy  grace,  and  live  henceforth  not  unto  myself,  but 
unto  thee,  our  Master  and  Benefactor.  And  so,  this  life  ended  in  the  hope 
of  life  everlasting,  I  may  come  unto  that  rest  eternal,  where  the  voice  of 
those  who  keep  high  festival  ceaseth  never,  and  where  endless  is  the  sweet- 
ness of  those  who  behold  the  beauty  inexpressible  of  thy  countenance. 
For  thou  art  the  true  desire  and  the  happiness  unutterable  of  those  who 
love  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  and  every  created  being  shall  laud  thee  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

A  Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

O  Lord  Christ-God,  King  of  the  Ages,  and  Maker  of  all  men,  I  thank 
thee  for  all  the  good  things  which  thou  hast  bestowed  upon  me,  and  for 
this  Communion  of  thy  most  pure  and  life-giving  Mysteries.  Therefore 
I  entreat  thee,  O  Good  One  who  lovest  mankind:  Keep  me  in  thy  taber- 
nacle and  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings;  and  grant  that,  with  a  pure  con- 
science, even  unto  my  uttermost  breath,  I  may  worthily  partake  of  thy 
Holy  Things,  unto  the  remission  of  my  sins,  and  unto  life  eternal.  For 
thou  art  the  Bread  of  Life,  the  Fountain  of  all  holiness,  the  Giver  of  good 
things;  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and 
to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  Amen. 
A  Prayer  of  St.  Simeon  Metaphrastis. 

O  thou  who,  of  thine  own  good  will,  dost  give  me  thy  body  as  my  food; 
thou  who  art  a  Fire  consuming  the  unworthy:  Consume  me  not,  O  my 
Creator.  But  enter  thou  rather  into  my  members,  into  my  whole  being, 
all  my  joints,  my  reins,  my  heart.  Consume  thou  the  thorns  of  all  mine 
iniquities.  Cleanse  my  soul.  Sanctify  my  thoughts.  Make  stable  my 
knees,  and  my  bones  likewise.     Enlighten  my  five  simple  sense?.     Knit

me  wholly  to  the  fear  of  thee.  Ever  cover  me,  guard  me  and  keep  me 
from  every  word  and  deed  which  may  hurt  the  soul.  Purify  me  and  wash 
me  clean,  and  bring  me  into  concord.  Adorn  me,  give  me  understanding 
and  enlighten  me.  Manifest  me  as  the  dwelling  of  thy  one  Spirit,  and  in 
nowise  as  the  dwelling  of  sin.  That  being  made  thy  tabernacle  through 
the  reception  of  thy  holy  Communion  every  evil  thing,  every  carnal  pas- 
sion may  flee  away  from  me  as  from  fire.  I  offer  unto  thee  as  intercessors 
all  the  Saints,  the  Chieftains  of  the  Bodiless  Powers,  thy  Forerunner,  the 
wise  Apostles,  and  joined  with  them  thy  Mother  pure  and  undefiled ;  whose 
prayers  do  thou  accept,  in  thy  tender  loving- kindness,  O  my  Christ,  and 
make  thy  servant  to  be  a  child  of  the  light.  For  thou  alone  art  the  sanc- 
tification  and  splendour  of  our  souls,  O  Good  One,  and  unto  thee,  as  God 
and  Lord  over  all,  do  we,  as  it  behooveth  us,  every  day  ascribe  all  glory. 

Another  Prayer. 

May  thy  holy  Body,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  profit  me  unto  life 
eternal,  and  thy  precious  Blood  unto  the  remission  of  my  sins.  May  this 
Eucharist  be  unto  me  for  joy,  and  health,  and  gladness,  and  render  me,  a 
sinner,  worthy  to  stand  at  the  right  hand  of  thy  glory  in  thy  terrible  and 
second  Coming-again;  through  the  intercessions  of  thine  all-pure  Mother, 
and  all  of  the  Saints. 

Another  Prayer,  to  the  Most  Holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

O  all-holy  Lady,  Birth-giver  of  our  God,  of  my  darkened  soul  the  light, 
hope,  shelter,  refuge,  the  consolation  and  the  joy:  I  thank  thee  that  thou 
hast  deemed  me,  all  unworthy  as  I  am,  worthy  to  be  a  partaker  of  the  pure 
Body  and  precious  Blood  of  thy  Son.  O  thou  who  didst  bring  forth  the 
true  Light,  enlighten  the  intellectually-discerning  eyes  of  my  heart;  O  thou 
who  didst  bear  the  Fountain  of  Immortality,  quicken  thou  me,  who  lie 
dead  in  sin.  O  compassionately  loving  Mother  of  the  merciful  God,  have 
mercy  upon  me,  and  grant  unto  me  humility  and  contrition  of  heart,  and 
humbleness  of  mind,  and  deliverance  from  bondage  to  evil  thoughts.  And 
vouchsafe  that  even  unto  my  last  breath  I  may,  without  condemnation, 
receive  the  sanctification  of  these  Holy  Mysteries,  unto  the  healing  of 
both  soul  and  body.  And  grant  me  tears  of  penitence  and  of  confession, 
that  I  may  laud  and  glorify  thee  all  the  days  of  my  life.  For  blessed  art 
thou  and  all-glorified  unto  all  the  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  according  to  thy 
word.  For  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation,  which  thou  hast  prepared 
before  the  face  of  all  people.  To  be  a  light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  to 
be  the  glory  of  thy  people  Israel. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  125 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  in- 
firmities, for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver 
us  from  the  Evil  One: 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

The  Hymn  (Tropdr)  of  Dismissal,  in  Tone  V.: 

The  grace  of  thy  lips,  shining  forth  like  a  beacon-fire,  hath  illu- 
mined the  universe,  and  hath  bestowed  upon  the  world  the  treasure 
of  non-avariciousness,  and  hath  shown  us  the  height  of  humility. 
But  as  thou  instructest  us  with  thy  words,  O  Father  John  Chrysos- 
tom,  so  also  intercede  thou  with  Christ  God,  the  Word,  that  our  souls 
may  be  saved. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  VI.: 
From  heaven  hast  thou  received  grace  divine,  and  with  thy  lips 
dost  thou  teach  all  men  to  adore  the  One  God  in  three  Persons. 
O  John  Chrysostom,  all-blessed  Saint,  we  rightly  praise  thee:  for 
thou  art  our  Teacher,  in  that  thou  dost  reveal  things  divine. 
Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

[But  if  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  hath  been  used,  this  Hymn 

(Tropdr),  in  Tone  I.: 

Thy  voice  is  gone  out  into  all  the  world,  in  that  it  hath  received 
thy  word,  wherewith  thou  hast  taught  in  manner  well  pleasing  unto 
God,  hast  expounded  the  nature  of  existing  things,  and  hast  adorned 
the  customs  of  mankind.  O  Royal  Priesthood,  Sainted  Father,  pray 
thou  unto  Christ  our  God  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 
Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  IV.: 

Thou  hast  shown  thyself  a  foundation  immovable  of  the  Church, 
dispensing  unto  all  men  the  dominion  inviolate,  sealing  it  with  thy 
decrees,  O  Saint  Basil,  who  wast  manifested  from  heaven.] 

Hymn  to  the  Holy  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen). 
O  Protection  of  Christians  that  maketh  not  ashamed,  O  Mediatrix 
never-failing  with  the  Creator:  Despise  not  the  sinners'  voice  of  sup- 
plication; but  in  that  thou  art  good,  come  speedily  to  the  aid  of  us 
who  faithfully  call  upon  thee;  make  haste  to  our  petition  and  further 
our  prayer,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  ever  protectest  them  that  do 
thee  honour. 


126  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY 

The  Priest  and  Deacon  wash  their  hands  at  the  appointed  place;  and  having  done 
reverence  together,  the  Priest  shall  pronounce  the  Dismissal.  And  giving  thanks 
unto  God  for  all  things,  they  shall  say,  also,  the  proper  Hymn  for  the  Day.  Then: 
Lord,  have  mercy.     {Twelve  times.) 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glo- 
rious than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE 
PRESANCTIFIED   (GIFTS)* 


PREFATORY  NOTE 

During  the  Holy  and  Great  Fast,  when  the  Priest  is  to  celebrate  the  Liturgy  of  the 
Presanctified,  at  the  Office  of  Oblation  on  the  Sunday  preceding,  (i)  after  he  hath 
cut  the  first  altar-bread,  and  sacrificed  and  pierced  it  (as  indicated  in  the  Ritual  of 
the  preceding  Liturgy),  he  cutteth  the  extra  breads,  saying  over  each  one  of  them 
these  words  following: 

In  commemoration  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ. 

He  was  led  as  a  lamb  to  the  slaughter.  And  as  a  spotless  lamb  before  its  shearers 
is  dumb,  so  opened  he  not  his  mouth. 

Sacrificed  is  the  Lamb  of  God,  who  taketh  away  the  sins  of  the  world,  for  the  life 
of  the  world,  and  for  its  salvation. 

One  of  the  soldiers  did  pierce  his  side  with  a  spear,  and  straightway  there  came 
forth  blood  and  water.     And  he  that  saw  it  bare  witness,  and  his  witness  is  true. 

Then  he  poureth  the  wine  and  water  into  the  holy  chalice,  saying  the  customary 
words;  and  covereth  them  with  the  holy  veil,  and  censeth  them,  repeating  the  Prayer 
of  Oblation.     And  then  he  beginneth  the  Divine  Liturgy  and  celebrateth  as  usual. 

And  when  he  is  to  sign  the  breads,  at  the  invocation  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  he  saith:  Make 
this  bread  the  precious  Body  of  thy  Christ,  in  the  singular,  and  he  doth  not  speak 
of  the  breads  in  the  plural.  And  when  he  maketh  the  oblation,  he  offereth  them  all 
together.  And  he  breaketh  only  the  first  bread,  and  layeth  the  portion  in  the  holy 
chalice,  and  poureth  in  the  warm  water  as  usual. 

Then,  taking  the  holy  spoon  in  his  right  hand,  he  dippeth  it  in  the  Holy  Blood.  With 
his  left  hand  he  taketh  one  of  the  breads,  and  toucheth  it  with  the  holy  spoon,  which 
hath  been  wetted  with  the  Holy  Blood,  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  on  the  side  whereon  is 
depicted  the  cross,  under  the  soft  portion,  and  placeth  it  in  the  tabernacle. 

Then  he  doth  the  same  with  the  other  breads,  and  placeth  them  all  in  the  tabernacle. 
Thereafter  the  Priest  prayeth  as  usual,  and  communicateth  as  usual,  and  per- 
formed the  Divine  Liturgy  as  usual. 


When  a  Priest  is  to  celebrate  the 
Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified,  after 
he  hath  read  the  Entrance  Prayer, 
as  in  the  ordinary  Liturgy  (ex- 
cept: Stretch  forth  thy  hand,  O 
Lord :  at  the  end  of  the  Hours  and 
the  Typical  Psalms,  and  what  is 
generally  read  before  the  Liturgy^) 
he  entereth  the  Chapel  of  Obla- 
tion, and  vesteth  himself,  signing 
with  the  cross  and  kissing  each 
vestment,  but  saying  nothing  as 
he  doth  so,  except:  Lord,  have

is  met  in  the  usual  manner,  and  the 
usual  Entrance  Prayers  are  read, 
with  the  exception  of:  Stretch  forth 
thy  hand,  O  Lord.  He  is  vested,  as 
usual,  in  the  centre  of  the  Temple, 
but  without  the  Verses,  and  only 
with  the  exclamations:  Let  us  pray 
to  the  Lord. 

Before  Vespers  is  begun,  the  Bishop 
standeth  in  his  place,  in  the  centre 
of  the  Temple,  and  bestoweth  his 
blessing  on  the  Rector  and  the  Deacon

the  Deacon,  taking  the  time  from 
him,  goeth  and  taketh  his  stand 
at  his  appointed  place,  and  {the 
Holy  Door  being  closed,  and  the 
curtain  drawn  aside),  exclaim- 
eth: 


to  begin  Vespers,  he  himself  remain- 
ing on  his  dais  until  the  Little  En- 
trance. The  Priest  readeth  the 
Prayers  of  Light  in  the  Sanctuary. 
The  Holy  Door  is  opened  at  the  Ex- 
clamations, and  during  the  Litanies, 
but  remaineth  closed  the  rest  of  the 
time  until  the  Entrance.

heard  me.  Deliver  my  soul,  O 
Lord,  from  lying  lips,  and  from

Psalm  cxxiii.

Behold,  even  as  the  eyes  of  servants  look  unto  the  hand  of  their  masters,

The  Second  Antiphon  {Psalms  cxxiv.,  cxxix.). 

Psalm  cxxiv. 
If  the  Lord  himself  had  not  been  on  our 
side,  now  may  Israel  say;  if  the  Lord  him- 
self had  not  been  on  our  side,  when  men 
rose  up  against  us;  they  had  swallowed  us 
up  quick;  when  they  were  so  wrathfully  dis- 
pleased at  us.  Yea,  the  waters  had  drowned 
us,  and  the  stream  had  gone  over  our  soul. 
The  deep  waters  of  the  proud  had  gone 
even  over  our  soul.  But  praised  be  the 
Lord,  who  hath  not  given  us  over  for  a 
prey  un-to  their  teeth.  Our  soul  is  escaped 
even  as  a  bird  out  of  the  snare  of  the  fowler; 
the  snare  is  broken,  and  we  are  delivered.

Our  help  standeth  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord ; 
who  hath  made  heaven  and  earth. 

Psalm  cxxix. 
Many  a  time  have  they  fought  against 
me  from  my  youth  up,  may  Israel  now  say: 
yea,  many  a  time  have  they  vexed  me  from 
my  youth  up;  but  they  have  not  prevailed 
against  me.  The  plowers  plowed  upon  my 
back,  and  made  long  furrows.  But  the 
righteous  Lord  hath  hewn  the  snares  of  the 
ungodly  in  pieces.  Let  them  be  confounded 
and  turned  backward,  as  many  as  have  evil 
will  at  Zion.  Let  them  be  even  as  the  grass 
growing  upon  the  house-tops,  which  wither- 
ed! afore  it  be  plucked  up;  whereof  the 
mower  filleth  not  his  hand,  neither  he  that 
bindeth  up  the  sheaves  his  bosom.  So  that 
they  who  go  by  say  not  so  much  as,  The 
Lord  prosper  you;  we  wish  you  good  luck 
in  the  Name  of  the  Lord.

of  my  prayer,  when  I  call  upon  thee.  Hear

thy  sight  as  the  incense,  and  let  the  lifting 
up  of  my  hands  be  an  evening  sacrifice.

petitions  which  are 
unto  salvation,  and

may  love  and  fear 
thee  with  all  our 
hearts,  and  do  thy 
will  in  all  things.

a  good  God,  and  lov- 
est  mankind,  and  un- 
to thee  do  we  ascribe 
glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to

The  Priest  maketh 
three  lowly  reverences 
to  the  Holy  Gifts, 
setteth  the  paten  on 
his  head,  and  beareth 
it  to  the  Table  of  Ob- 
lation, preceded  by  the 
Deacon  with  the  taper 
and  censer.  Then,  on 
the  Table  of  Oblation 
he  poureth  wine  and 
water  into  the  chal- 
ice, censeth  the  star- 
cover  and  the  veil, 
and  covereth  there- 
with the  paten  and 
the  chalice,  saying 
the  while: 

Through  the  prayers 
of  our  holy  Fathers, 
O  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
our  God,  have  mercy 
upon  us. 

Then  he  goeth  to  the  Al- 
tar, foldeth  the  cor- 
poral, and  setteth  the 
Gospels  thereon. 

The  Priest  saith,  se- 
cretly, the  Prayer  of 
the  Entrance. 

In  the  evening,  and 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANCTIFIED 


not  mine  heart  be  inclined  to  any  evil  thing; 
let  me  not  be  occupied  in  ungodly  works 
with  the  men  that  work  wickedness,  lest  I 
eat  of  such  things  as  please  them.  Let  the 
righteous  rather  smite  me  friendly,  and  re- 
prove me.  But  let  not  their  precious  balms 
break  my  head;  yea,  I  will  pray  yet  against 
their  wickedness.  Let  their  judges  be  over- 
thrown in  stony  places,  that  they  may  hear 
my  words;  for  they  are  sweet.  Our  bones 
lie  scattered  before  the  pit,  like  as  when  one 
breaketh  and  heweth  wood  upon  the  earth. 
But  mine  eyes  look  unto  thee,  O  Lord  God; 
in  thee  is  my  trust;  O  cast  not  out  my  soul. 
Keep  me  from  the  snare  that  they  have  laid 
for  me,  and  from  the  traps  of  the  wicked 
doers.  Let  the  ungodly  fall  into  their  own 
nets  together,  and  let  me  ever  escape  them. 

Psalm  cxlii. 
I  cried  unto  the  Lord  with  my  voice;  yea, 
even  unto  the  Lord  did  I  make  my  suppli- 
cation. I  poured  out  my  complaints  before 
him,  and  showed  him  of  my  trouble.  When 
my  spirit  was  in  heaviness,  thou  knewest 
my  path;  in  the  way  wherein  I  walked,  have 
they  privily  laid  a  snare  for  me.  I  looked 
also  upon  my  right  hand,  and  saw  there  was 
no  man  that  would  know  me.  I  had  no  place 
to  flee  unto,  and  no  man  cared  for  my  soul.  " 

I  cried  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  and  said,  Thou  art  my  hope,  and  my  portion  in 
the  land  of  the  living.  Consider  my  complaint,  for  I  am  brought  very 
lew.  O  deliver  me  from  my  persecutors;  for  they  are  too  strong  for  me. 
В  ling  my  soul  out  of  prison,  that  I  may  give  thanks  unto  thy  Name; 
which  thing  if  thou  wilt  grant  me,  then  shall  the  righteous  resort  unto  my 
company. 

Then  shall  be  sung  Hymns  to  the  Martyrs,  and  Hymns  from  the  Triodion  (the  Hymns 
for  the  Great  Fast),  and  from  the  Miniya.  (2) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

{Here  the  Holy  Voor  is  opened.) 


In  place  of  the   Cherubimic  Hymn 
there  shall  now  be  sung: 

Now  the  Powers  of  Heaven 
with  us  invisibly  do  minister. 
For  lo!  the  King  of  Glory  en- 
tereth  now.  Behold  the  Mystical 
Sacrifice,  all  accomplished,  is 
ushered  in. 

{Here  the  Great  Entrance  is  made.) 

Let  us  with  faith  and  love 
draw  near,  that  we  may  become 
partakers  of  life  everlasting.  Al- 
leluia, alleluia,  alleluia. 

At  a  Pontifical  Service  the  Bishop 
washeth  his  hands  in  front  of 
the  Holy  Door.  {See  p.  79.) 
Then  his  pall  {omofor)  is  put 
on  him,  and  he  maketh  three 
lowly  reverences  before  the 
Holy  Altar,  saying:  Now  the 
Powers  of  Heaven.  Then 

he  goeth  to  the  Table  of  Obla- 
tion, and  maketh  three  rever- 
ences, saying:  O  God,  cleanse 
thou  me,  a  sinner;  removeth  his 
mitre,  giveth  his  pall  to  the  Dea- 
con, and  censeth  the  Table  of 
Oblation  thrice,  after  which  he 
giveth  the  censer  to  the  Proto- 
Deacon;  and  taking  the  air  in 
both  hands,  he  layeth  it  on  the 
shoulder  of  the  Proto-Deacon. 

The  Bishop  then  taketh  the  holy  paten  with  both  hands,  and  having  kissed  it,  he 
setteth  it  on  the  head  of  the  senior  Priest,  but  saith  nothing.  The  Priest  kisseth 
the  Bishop's  hand.  Another  Priest,  after  making  a  reverence  to  the  Bishop,  taketh 
from  him  the  holy  chalice,  and  kisseth  his  hand.  The  other  Priests  who  take  part 
in  the  celebration  carry  the  cross,  the  spoon,  the  spear,  and  ihe  rest  of  the  holy 
utensils,  and  kiss  the  Bishop's  hand.  And  all  come  forth  in  the  same  order  as  at 
the  Great  Entrance  in  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  or  St.  Basil  the  Great. 


And  while  this  is  being  sung  the  Dea- 
con entereth  the  Sanctuary  through 
the  north  door,  and  censeth  the  Holy 
Altar  and  the  holy  oblation  and 
the  Priest.  And  they  stand  there, 
saying  thrice:  Now  the  Powers  of 
Heaven.  ,  .  And  having  made 
three  lowly  reverences,  they  go  to 
the  Chapel  of  Oblation;  and  the 
Priest  bringeth  the  Holy  Gifts,  as 
usual,  after  he  hath  made  three 
lowly  reverences  before  the  Table 
of  Oblation,  saying:  O  God,  cleanse 
thou  me,  a  sinner.  While  the  Di- 
vine Mysteries  are  being  borne  in 
solemn  silence  from  the  Chapel  of 
Oblation  to  the  Altar,  all  the  Peo- 
ple and  the  Singers,  kneeling  hum- 
bly, render  divine  reverence  to 
Christ  our  God,  who  is  in  the  Holy 
Mysteries;  for  they  are  presancti- 
fied.  After  the  Holy  Gifts  have 
been  brought  to  the  Altar,  all  stand, 
and  the  Singers  finish  the  Hymn, 
as  indicated:  Let  us  with  faith  and 
love  draw  near: 

After  the  Holy  Gifts  have  been  placed 
on  the  Altar,  the  Priest  taketh  the 
veil  from  the  Holy  Gifts  and  the 
air  from  the  shoulder  of  the  Dea- 
con, approacheth  the  air  to  the  cen- 
ser, and  covereth  therewith  with 
fragrance  the  Holy  Gifts.

When  the  Bishop  comcth  to  the  Holy  Door,  the  Proto-Deacon  taketh  his  stand 
opposite  him  and  censeth  'him.  The  Bishop,  taking  the  censer,  censeth  the 
Holy  Gifts  thrice,  and  having  made  a  reverence,  he  receiveth  the  holy  paten 
from  the  head  of  the  Senior  Priest,  kisseth  it,  and  showeth  it  to  the  People, 
without  saying  anything.  And  the  Priest  bearing  the  chalice  entereth  the 
Sanctuary,  saying  nothing.  But  the  Bishop  setteth  the  holy  chalice  upon 
the  Altar.     The  other  Priests  enter  the  Sanctuary  without  saying  anything. 

The  Bishop  removeth  the  air  from  the  shoulder  of  the  Proto-Deacon,  holdeth  it 
over  the  censer,  and  cover eth  the  paten  and  the  chalice  with  fragrance,  saying 
nothing.  Then  he  putteth  on  his  mitre,  and  censeth  the  Holy  Gifts  only,  and 
maketh  three  reverences,  and  giveth  the  censer  to  the  Deacon,  ivithout  censing, 
any  one. 

And  he  bestoweth  his  blessing  on  the  People,  as  usual,  with  the  dikiri  and  the 

trikiri  while  the  Choir  singeth:  Eis  polla  eti,  Despota. 
Then  the  Priest  saith,  aloud,  the  Prayer  of  St.  Ephraim  the  Syrian;  and  maketh 
the  prescribed  reverences,  the  People  kneeling  with  him. 

O  Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  grant  not  unto  me  a  spirit  of  slothful- 
ness,  of  discouragement,  of  lust  of  power,  of  vain  babbling.     {Reverence.) 

But  vouchsafe  unto  me,  thy  servant,  the  spirit  of  continence,  of  meek- 
ness, of  patience,  and  of  love.     {Reverence.) 

Yea,  O  Lord  and  King,  grant  that  I  may  perceive  my  own  transgres- 
sions, and  judge  not  my  brother.  For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen.     {Reverence.) 

Here  the  Holy  Door  is  closed,  and  the  curtain  is  drawn  halfway.  (5) 
Then  the  Deacon  goeth  to  his  accustomed  place,  and  saith: 

Let  us  complete  our  evening  prayer  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy  -

cleanse  us,  O  thou  who  sittest  on  high  with  the  Father,  and  art  here 
invisibly  present  with  us:  and  graciously  vouchsafe,  by  thy  mighty 
hand,  to  impart  unto  us  thy  most  holy  Body,  and  thy  most  precious 
Blood,  and  by  us  to  all  thy  people. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  the  Priest  and  Deacon  make  three  reverences,  saying: 

O  God,  cleanse  thou  me,  a  sinner. 

Then  the  Priest,  the  Holy  Gifts  being  still  covered,  laying  on  his  hand  doth  (6) 
touch  the  life-giving  Bread  with  great  reverence  and  fear.  And  the  Deacon 
saith: 

Let  us  attend. 

The  Priest  exclaimeth: 
The  Presanctified  Holy  Things  to  the  hofy. 

Choir.  One  only  is  holy,  one  only  is  the  Lord,  Jesus  Christ,  in  the  glory 
of  God  the  Father.     Amen. 

(The  rest  of  the  curtain  is  now  drawn.) 

And  when  the  Priest  hath  said:  The  Presanctified  Holy  Things  to  the  holy:  he 
layeth^  aside  the  holy  veil,  and  the  Deacon  entereth  the  holy  Sanctuary;  and 
standing  near  the  Priest,  he  saith: 

Break,  Master,  the  holy  Bread. 

And  the  Priest,  with  great  heedfulness,  breaketh  it  into  four  pieces,  saying: 

Broken  and  divided  is  the  Lamb  of  God,  which  is  broken,  yet  not 

disunited;  ever  eaten,  yet  never  consumed,  but  sanctifieth  those  who 

partake  thereof. 


Choir.  The  Short  Canon. 
O  taste,  and  see  how  good  the 
Lord  is.     Alleluia,  alleluia,  alle- 
luia. 


participation  in  thy  Holy  Myster- 
ies be  unto  judgment  upon  me,  or 
unto  condemnation,  O  Lord,  but 
unto  the  healing  of  soul  and  body. 

And  in  this  manner  they  partake  of  the  Holy  Mysteries,  with  awe  and  all  godly 
fear. 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANCTIFIED  143 

And  he  layeth  a  portion  on  the  paten,  saying  nothing:  and  the  Deacon  poureth 
the  warm  water  into  the  chalice,  saying  nothing.  And  he  standeth  a  little 
apart.     Then  the  Priest  saith: 

Deacon,  draw  near. 

And  the  Deacon,  approaching,  maketh  a  devout  reverence,  asking  forgiveness, 
and  saith: 

Lo,  I  draw  near  unto  the  King  immortal,  and  to  God. 
Impart  unto  me,  Master,  the  precious  and  holy  Body  and  Blood  of 
our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ. 

And  the  Priest,  taking  a  portion  of  the  Holy  Mysteries,  giveth  it  to  the  Deacon, 
saying: 

To  N.,  Deacon,  is  imparted  the  precious,  and  holy,  and  all-pure 
Body  and  Blood  of  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ, 
unto  the  remission  of  his  sins,  and  unto  life  everlasting. 

And  the  Deacon,  having  kissed  the  Priest's  hand,  shall  withdraw,  and  stand  be- 
hind the  Holy  A  Itar;  and  bowing  his  head,  he  shall  pray,  like  the  Priest,  I  be- 
lieve, O  Lord,  and  I  confess.  .  .  And  the  Priest  also,  taking  in  the  same 
manner  a  portion  of  the  Holy  Mysteries,  saith: 

The  precious  and  all-holy  Body  and  Blood  of  our  Lord,  and  God, 
and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,  is  imparted  to  me,  N.,  Priest,  unto  the  re- 
mission of  my  sins,  and  unto  life  everlasting. 

And  bowing  his  head,  he  prayeih,  saying: 

I  believe,  O  Lord,  and  I  confess,  that  thou  art,  in  very  truth,  the 
Christ  the  Son  of  the  living  God,  who  didst  come  into  the  world  to 
save  sinners,  of  whom  I  am  chief.  And  I  believe  that  this  is,  of  a 
truth,  thine  all-pure  Body,  and  that  this  is  thine  own  precious  Blood. 
Wherefore  I  beseech  thee,  have  mercy  upon  me,  and  forgive  my  trans- 
gressions, whether  voluntary  or  involuntary;  whether  of  word  or  of 
deed ;  whether  committed  with  knowledge  or  in  ignorance.  And  vouch- 
safe that  I  may  partake  without  condemnation  of  thine  all-pure  Mys- 
teries, unto  the  remission  of  my  sins,  and  unto  life  eternal. 

Of  thy  Mystical  Supper,  O  Son  of  God,  accept  me  to-day  as  a 
communicant:  for  I  will  not  speak  of  thy  Mystery  to  thine  enemies, 
neither  like  Judas  will  I  give  thee  a  kiss;  but  like  the  thief  will  I  confess 
thee:  Remember  me,  O  Lord,  in  thy  kingdom.     And  let  not  this 


144  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANCTIFIED 

Then  he  taketh  the  holy  chalice  with  the  veil  in  both  hands,  and  drinketh  from 
it,  saving  nothing;  and  wipeth  his  mouth  and  the  holy  chalice  with  the  veil 
which  is  in  his  hands,  setteth  it  on  the  Holy  Altar,  and  saith,  secretly,  the 
Prayer  of  Thanksgiving: 
We  give  thanks  unto  thee,  O  God,  the  Saviour  of  all  men,  for  all 
the  good  things  which  thou  hast  vouchsafed  unto  us,  and  for  the 
Communion  of  the  holy  Body  and  Blood  of  thy  Christ.     And  we  be- 
seech thee,  O  Lord,  who  lovest  mankind,  to  keep  us  under  the  shelter 
of  thy  wings.    And  grant  that,  even  to  our  last  breath,  we  may  worth- 
ily partake  of  thy  Holy  Things,  unto  the  illumination  of  soul  and 
body,  and  unto  the  inheritance  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

The  Deacon  doth  not  drink  from  the  chalice  at  this  time,  but  after  the  Prayer  before  the 
Tribune,  and  after  the  remaining  particles  of  the  Holy  Mysteries  have  been  con- 
sumed. {But  'if  the  Priest  celebrate  alone,  without  a  Deacon,  he,  also,  doth  not 
drink  from  the  chalice  after  his  Communion,  but  after  the  Liturgy  is  finished,  and 
after  the  Holy  Mysteries  have  been  consumed.  For  if  the  wine  be  sanctified  by  plac- 
ing in  it  the  particles,  yet  hath  it  not  been  transmuted  into  the  Divine  Blood,  seeing 
that  the  words  of  consecration  are  not  recited  over  it  in  this  service,  as  they  are  in  the 
Liturgies  of  Basil  the  Great  and  John  Chrysostom.)  And  the  Deacon,  taking  the 
holy  paten,  approacheth  it  to  the  holy  chalice,  and  putteth  in  the  Holy  Gifts,  saying 
nothing.  And  having  made  three  reverences,  he  draweth  aside  the  curtain,  and 
openeth  the  Holy  Door. 

But  if  there  be  Communicants  from  the  People,  the  Deacon,  having  covered  the  Holy 
Things  as  usual,  and  drawn  aside  the  curtain,  and  opened  the  Holy  Door,  taketh  the 
sacred  chalice  from  the  hands  of  the  Priest  or  the  Bishop,  and  saith: 

In  the  fear  of  God,  and  with  faith,  draw  near. 

And  the  Communion  is  administered  as  usual.  (As  a  rule,  infants  are  not  admitted 
to  this  Communion.) 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  O  God,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  heritage. 

Choir.  I  will  bless  the  Lord  at  all  times.  His  praise  shall  continually 
be  in  my  mouth.  Taste  ye  the  heavenly  Bread  and  the  Cup  of  Life,  and 
see  how  good  the  Lord  is.     Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia. 

And  when  he  hath  censed  the  Holy  Things,  he  giveth  the  censer  to  the  Deacon.  And 
taking  the  holy  paten,  he  setteth  it  on  the  head  of  the  Deacon.  And  the  Deacon, 
taking  it  with  all  reverence,  gazeth  out  through  the  Holy  Door,  but  doth  not  say  any- 
thing; and  he  goeth  to  the  Chapel  of  Oblation,  and  there  setteth  it  down.  Then  the 
Priest  taketh  the  holy  chalice,  and  turning  towards  the  Holy  Door,  he  looketh  forth 
upon  the  People,  saying,  secretly: 

Blessed  is  our  God. 

And  aloud: 

Always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

And  he  beareth  the  Holy  Things  to  the  Chapel  of  Oblation. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Let  our  mouths  be  filled  with  thy  praise,  O  Lord,  that  we  may  extol  thy 
glory:  for  that  thou  hast  deigned  to  make  us  partakers  of  thy  holy,  divine, 
immortal  and  life-giving  Mysteries.     Establish  us  in  thy  Sanctification, 


THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANCTIFIED  145 

that  all  the  day  long  we  may  meditate  upon  thy  righteousness.  Alleluia, 
alleluia,  alleluia. 

Deacon.  Having  received  the  divine,  holy,  pure,  immortal,  heavenly, 
life-giving  and  terrible  Mysteries  of  Christ,  O  believers,  let  us  worthily 
give  thanks  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy 

Having  besought  an  evening  all-perfect,  holy,  peaceful  and  sinless,  let 
us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto  Christ  our 
God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

{Here  the  corporal  is  folded,  and  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospel  is  set  upon  it.) 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  For  thou  art  our  sanctification,  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory, 
to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Let  us  depart  in  peace. 

Choir.  In  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Prayer  before  the  Tribune  is  then  said,  aloud : 
O  Almighty  Lord,  who  hast  made  all  created  things  in  wisdom,  and  by 
thine  inexpressible  Providence  and  great  goodness  hast  brought  us  to  these 
all-holy  days,  for  the  purification  of  body  and  soul,  for  the  controlling  of 
carnal  passions,  and  for  the  hope  of  the  Resurrection;  who,  during  the 
forty  days  didst  give  into  the  hand  of  thy  servant  Moses  the  Tables  of  the 
Law,  in  characters  divinely  traced  by  thee:  Enable  us  also,  O  Good  One, 
to  fight  the  good  fight;  to  accomplish  the  course  of  the  Fast;  to  preserve 
inviolate  the  faith;  to  crush  under  foot  the  heads  of  invisible  serpents;  to 
be  accounted  victors  over  sin ;  and  uncondemned  to  attain  unto  and  adore 
the  holy  Resurrection.  For  blessed  and  glorified  is  thine  all-honourable 
and  majestic  Name,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

The  Priest,  secretly: 
O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast 
brought  us  to  these  all-holy  days, 
and  hast  made  us  partakers  of  thy 
terrible  Mysteries :  Unite  us  to  thy 
rational  flock,  and  make  us  heirs  of 
thy  kingdom,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 


Choir.  Amen. 

Blessed  be  the  Name  of  the 
Lord  henceforth  and  for  ever. 
{Thrice.) 

And   Psalm   xxxiv.:    I    will  alway 
give  thanks.  {See  page  121.) 


146  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANCTIFIED 

Then  the  Priest  cometh  forth,  and  standing  in  his  accustomed  place,  he  saith: 

The  blessing  of  the  Lord,  through  his  grace  and  love  towards  mankind, 
be  upon  you  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  Christ-God,  our  sure  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  now    and    ever  .  .     Lord,    have    mercy.       {Thrice.) 

Master,  bless. 

Then  he  bestoweth  the  Benediction. 

May  Christ  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  all-holy  Mother; 
of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles;  and  of  Saint  N.  (the  Saint 
of  the  day) ;  and  of  our  father  in  the  Saints,  Gregory  Homiliastes,  and  of  all 
the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good  and 
loveth  mankind. 

After  this  Final  Benediction,  the  rest  of  the  ceremony  followeth  as  at  the  ordinary 
Liturgy;  except  that  instead  of  the  Hymns  there  used,  the  Hymn  here  following  is 
read: 

Hymn  in  Tone  IV 
That  which  constituteth  the  verity  of  things  revealed  thee  as  a  Rule  of 
the  faith,  a  Pattern  of  meekness  and  a  Preceptor  of  continence  to  thy 
flock:  wherefore  thou,  through  humility,  didst  win  exaltation,  and  by 
poverty  didst  win  wealth.  O  Father  Gregory,  pray  thou  unto  Christ  our 
God,  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 
O  Protection  of  Christians  that  maketh  not  ashamed,  O  Mediatrix 
never-failing  with  the  Creator:  Despise  not  the  sinners'  voice  of  supplica- 
tion; but  in  that  thou  art  good,  come  speedily  to  the  aid  of  us  who  faith- 
fully call  upon  thee;  make  haste  to  our  petition  and  further  our  prayer, 
O  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  ever  protectest  them  that  do  thee  honour. 

end. 

(General  Note.  —  If  a  Bishop  be  the  celebrant,  he  communicateth  himself  and  the 
Clergy  as  indicated  in  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  and  St.  Basil;  and  the 
Choir  chanteth  at  the  usual  places:  Eis  polla  eti,  Despota.) 


THE  OFFICE  OF  GRAND  COMPLINE* 

The  Priest  saith:  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Reader.  Amen.     Glory  to  thee,  our  God;  glory  to  thee. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come  and 
take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save  our 
souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
{Thrice,  and  three  reverences.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us  from 
the  Evil  One : 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Reader.  Amen. Lord,  have  mercy.     {Twelve  times.) 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  {Three  rever- 
ences.) 

And  if  it  be  during  the  first  week  of  the  Great  Fast  {Lent),  we  begin: 

Psalm  lxx. 

Haste  thee,  O  God,  to  deliver  me;  make  haste  to  help  me,  O 

Lord.     Let  them  be  ashamed  and  confounded  that  seek  after  my 

soul;  let  them  be  turned  backward  and  put  to  confusion  that  wish 

me  evil.     Let  them  for  their  reward  be  soon  brought  to  shame,  that

Epiphany;  and  sometimes  on  the  Eve  of  the  Annunciation.

cry  over  me,  There!  there!  But  let  all  those  that  seek  thee  be  joy- 
ful and  glad  in  thee:  and  let  all  such  as  delight  in  thy  salvation  say 
alway,  The  Lord  be  praised.  As  for  me,  I  am  poor  and  in  misery: 
haste  thee  unto  me,  O  God.  Thou  art  my  helper  and  my  redeemer: 
O  Lord,  make  no  long  tarrying. 

And  when  this  is  finished,  the  Great  Canon  of  St.  Andrew  of  Crete  is  chanted. 
But  otherwise,  the  beginning  is  as  followeth: 
Psalm  iv. 

Hear  me,  when  I  call,  O  God  of  my  righteousness:  thou  hast  set  me  at 
liberty,  when  I  was  in  trouble;  have  mercy  upon  me,  and  hearken  unto 
my  prayer.  O  ye  sons  of  men,  how  long  will  ye  blaspheme  mine  honour, 
and  have  such  pleasure  in  vanity,  and  seek  after  falsehood?  Know  this 
also,  that  the  Lord  hath  chosen  to  himself  the  man  that  is  godly;  when  I 
call  upon  the  Lord  he  will  hear  me.  Stand  in  awe,  and  sin  not;  commune 
with  your  own  heart,  and  in  your  chamber,  and  be  still.  Offer  the  sacri- 
fice of  righteousness,  and  put  your  trust  in  the  Lord.  There  be  many 
that  say,  Who  will  show  us  any  good?  Lord,  lift  thou  up  the  light  of  thy 
countenance  upon  us.  Thou  hast  put  gladness  in  my  heart,  since  the  time 
that  their  corn,  and  wine,  and  oil  increased.  I  will  lay  me  down  in  peace, 
and  take  my  rest;  for  it  is  thou,  Lord,  only,  that  makest  me  dwell  in  safety. 

Psalm  vi. 

O  Lord,  rebuke  me  not  in  thine  indignation,  neither  chasten  me  in  thy 
displeasure.  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  I  am  weak;  O  Lord,  heal 
me,  for  my  bones  are  vexed.  My  soul  also  is  sore  troubled:  but,  Lord, 
how  long  wilt  thou  punish  me?  Turn  thee,  O  Lord,  and  deliver  my  soul; 
O  save  me,  for  thy  mercy's  sake.  For  in  death  no  man  remembereth  thee; 
and  who  will  give  thee  thanks  in  the  pit?  I  am  weary  of  my  groaning: 
every  night  wash  I  my  bed,  and  water  my  couch  with  my  tears.  My 
beauty  is  gone  for  very  trouble,  and  worn  away  because  of  all  mine 
enemies.  Away  from  me,  all  ye  that  work  vanity;  for  the  Lord  hath 
heard  the  voice  of  my  weeping.  The  Lord  hath  heard  my  petition;  the 
Lord  will  receive  my  prayer.  All  mine  enemies  shall  be  confounded,  and 
sore  vexed;  they  shall  be  turned  back,  and  put  to  shame  suddenly. 

Psalm  xiii. 

How  long  wilt  thou  forget  me,  O  Lord;  for  ever?  how  long  wilt  thou 
hide  thy  face  from  me?  How  long  shall  I  seek  counsel  in  my  soul,  and  be 
so  vexed  in  my  heart?  how  long  shall  mine  enemies  triumph  over  me? 
Consider,  and  hear  me,  O  Lord  my  God;  lighten  mine  eyes,  that  I  sleep 
not  in  death ;  lest  mine  enemy  say,  I  have  prevailed  against  him:  for  if  I  be 
cast  down,  they  that  trouble  me  will  rejoice  at  it.  But  my  trust  is  in  thy 
mercy,  and  my  heart  is  joyful  in  thy  salvation.  I  will  sing  of  the  Lord, 
because  he  hath  dealt  so  lovingly  with  me ;  yea,  I  will  praise  the  Name  of 
the  Lord  most  Highest.    Consider,  and  hear  me,  O  Lord  my  God :  lighten

against  him. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

reverences.) 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Glory       .  now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Psalm  xxv. 
Unto  thee,  O  Lord,  will  I  lift  up  my  soul;  my  God,  I  have  put  my  trust 
in  thee:  O  let  me  not  be  confounded,  neither  let  mine  enemies  triumph 
over  me.  For  all  they  that  hope  in  thee  shall  not  be  ashamed;  but  such 
as  transgress  without  a  cause  shall  be  put  to  confusion.  Show  me  thy 
ways,  O  Lord,  and  teach  me  thy  paths.  Lead  me  forth  in  thy  truth,  and 
learn  me :  for  thou  art  the  God  of  my  salvation ;  in  thee  hath  been  my  hope 
all  the  day  long.  Call  to  remembrance,  O  Lord,  thy  tender  mercies,  and 
thy  loving-kindnesses,  which  have  been  ever  of  old.  O  remember  not  the 
sins  and  offences  of  my  youth;  but  according  to  thy  mercy  think  thou 
upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  thy  goodness.  Gracious  and  righteous  is  the  Lord; 
therefore  will  he  teach  sinners  in  the  way  Them  that  are  meek  shall  he 
guide  in  judgment:  and  such  are  as  gentle,  them  shall  he  learn  his  way. 
All  the  paths  of  the  Lord  are  mercy  and  truth,  unto  such  as  keep  his 
covenant  and  his  testimonies.  For  thy  Name's  sake,  O  Lord,  be  merciful 
unto  nvy  sin;  for  it  is  great.  What  man  is  he  that  feareth  the  Lord?  him 
shall  he  teach  in  the  way  that  he  shall  choose.  His  soul  shall  dwell  at 
ease,  and  his  seed  shall  inherit  the  land.  The  secret  of  the  Lord  is  among 
them  that  fear  him;  and  he  will  show  them  his  covenant.  Mine  eyes  are 
ever  looking  unto  the  Lord;  for  he  shall  pluck  my  feet  out  of  the  net. 
Turn  thee  unto  me,  and  have  mercy  upon  me;  for  I  am  desolate,  and  in 
misery.  The  sorrows  of  my  heart  are  enlarged :  O  bring  thou  me  out  of 
my  troubles.  Look  upon  my  adversity  and  misery,  and  forgive  me  all 
my  sin.  Consider  mine  enemies,  how  many  they  are;  and  they  bear  a 
tyrannous  hate  against  me.  O  keep  my  soul,  and  deliver  me;  let  me  not 
be  confounded,  for  I  have  put  my  trust  in  thee.  Let  perfectness  and 
righteous  dealing  wait  upon  me ;  for  my  hope  hath  been  in  thee.  Deliver 
Israel,  O  God,  out  of  all  his  troubles. 

Psalm  xxxi. 
In  thee,  O  Lord,  have  I  put  my  trust;  let  me  never  be  put  to  confusion; 
deliver  me  in  thy  righteousness.  Bow  down  thine  ear  to  me;  make  haste 
to  deliver  me.  And  be  thou  my  strong  rock,  and  house  of  defence,  that 
thou  mayest  save  me.  For  thou  art  my  strong  rock,  and  my  castle:  be 
thou  also  my  guide,  and  lead  me  for  thy  Name's  sake.  Draw  me  out  of 
the  net  that  they  have  laid  privily  for  me;  for  thou  art  my  strength.    Into

thy  hands  I  commend  my  spirit;  for  thou  hast  redeemed  me,  O  Lord,  thou 
God  of  truth.  I  have  hated  them  that  hold  of  superstitious  vanities,  and 
my  trust  hath  been  in  the  Lord.  I  will  be  glad,  and  rejoice  in  thy  mercy ; 
for  thou  hast  considered  my  trouble,  and  hast  known  my  soul  in  adversi- 
ties. Thou  hast  not  shut  me  up  into  the  hand  of  the  enemy ;  but  hast  set 
my  feet  in  a  large  room.  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  I  am  in 
trouble,  and  mine  eye  is  consumed  for  very  heaviness;  yea  my  soul  and 
my  body.  For  my  life  is  waxen  old  with  heaviness,  and  my  years  with 
mourning.  My  strength  faileth  me,  because  of  mine  iniquity,  and  my 
bones  are  consumed.  I  became  a  reproof  among  all  mine  enemies,  but 
especially  among  my  neighbours,  and  they  of  mine  acquaintance  were 
afraid  of  me ;  and  they  that  did  see  me  without,  conveyed  themselves  from 
me.  I  am  clean  forgotten  as  a  dead  man  out  of  mind ;  I  am  become  like  a 
broken  vessel.  For  I  have  heard  the  blasphemy  of  the  multitude,  and 
fear  is  on  every  side;  while  they  conspire  together  against  me,  and  take 
their  counsel  to  take  away  my  life.  But  my  hope  hath  been  in  thee,  0 
Lord ;  I  have  said,  Thou  art  my  God.  My  time  is  in  thy  hand ;  deliver  me 
from  the  hand  of  mine  enemies,  and  from  them  that  persecute  me.  Show 
thy  servant  the  light  of  thy  countenance,  and  save  me  for  thy  mercy's 
sake.  Let  me  not  be  confounded,  0  Lord,  for  I  have  called  upon  thee; 
let  the  ungodly  be  put  to  confusion,  and  be  put  to  silence  in  the  grave. 
Let  the  lying  lips  be  put  to  silence,  which  cruelly,  disdainfully,  and  de- 
spitefully  speak  against  the  righteous.  O  how  plentiful  is  thy  goodness, 
which  thou  hast  laid  up  for  them  that  fear  thee,  and  that  thou  hast  pre- 
pared for  them  that  put  their  trust  in  thee,  even  before  the  sons  of  men ! 
Thou  shalt  hide  them  privily  by  thine  own  presence  from  the  provoking 
of  all  men :  thou  shalt  keep  them  secretly  in  thy  tabernacle  from  the  strife 
of  tongues.  Thanks  be  to  the  Lord;  for  he  hath  showed  me  marvellous 
great  kindness  in  a  strong  city.  And  when  I  made  haste,  I  said,  I  am  cast 
out  of  the  sight  of  thine  eyes.  Nevertheless,  thou  heardest  the  voice  of 
my  prayer,  when  I  cried  unto  thee.  O  love  the  Lord,  all  ye  his 
saints;  for  the  Lord  preserveth  them  that  are  faithful,  and  plenteously 
rewardeth  the  proud  doer.  Be  strong,  and  he  shall  establish  your  heart, 
all  ye  that  put  your  trust  in  the  Lord. 

Psalm  xci. 
Whoso  dwelleth  under  the  defence  of  the  Most  High,  shall  abide  under 
the  shadow  of  the  Almighty.  I  will  say  unto  the  Lord,  Thou  art  my  hope, 
and  my  stronghold;  my  God,  in  him  will  I  trust.  For  he  shall  deliver  thee 
from  the  snare  of  the  hunter,  and  from  the  noisome  pestilence.  He  shall 
defend  thee  under  his  wings,  and  thou  shalt  be  safe  under  his  feathers;  his 
faithfulness  and  truth  shall  be  thy  shield  and  buckler.  Thou  shalt  not  be 
afraid  for  any  terror  by  night,  nor  for  the  arrow  that  flieth  by  day;  for  the 
pestilence  that  walketh  in  darkness,  nor  for  the  sickness  that  destroyeth 
in  the  noonday.     A  thousand  shall  fall  beside  thee,  and  ten  thousand  at

thy  right  hand;  but  it  shall  not  come  nigh  thee.  Yea,  with  thine  eyes 
shalt  thou  behold,  and  see  the  reward  of  the  ungodly.  For  thou,  Lord, 
art  my  hope;  thou  hast  set  thine  house  of  defence  very  high.  There  shall 
no  evil  happen  unto  thee,  neither  shall  any  plague  come  nigh  thy  dwelling. 
For  he  shall  give  his  angels  charge  over  thee,  to  keep  thee  in  all  thy  ways. 
They  shall  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  that  thou  hurt  not  thy  foot  against  a 
stone.  Thou  shalt  go  upon  the  lion  and  adder:  the  young  lion  and  the 
dragon  shalt  thou  tread  under  thy  feet.  Because  he  hath  set  his  love 
upon  me,  therefore  will  I  deliver  him ;  I  will  set  him  up,  because  he  hath 
known  my  Name.  He  shall  call  upon  me,  and  I  will  hear  him;  yea,  I  am 
with  him  in  trouble;  I  will  deliver  him  and  bring  him  to  honour.  With 
long  life  will  I  satisfy  him,  and  show  him  my  salvation. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia:  glory  to  thee,  O  God.  {Thrice,  and  three  rev- 
erences.)    Lord,  have  mercy.      {Thrice.)     Glory         now,  and  ever,     . 

Then  the  Choir  chanteth  the  Verses,  singing  them  with  sweet  melody,  slowly  and 
loudly. 

God  is  with  us:  understand,  ye  nations,  and  submit  yourselves:  for  God 
is  with  us. 

And  the  second  Choir  repeateth  the  same. 

Then  each  Choir  singeth  a  Verse  in  turn.    And  to  each  Verse  the  Refrain  is  sung: 
For  God  is  with  us. 

Hear  ye,  even  unto  the  uttermost  ends  of  the  earth :  1$ 
Submit  yourselves,  ye  mighty  ones : 

If  again  ye  shall  rise  up  in  your  might,  again  shall  ye  be  over- 
thrown :   1$ 

If  any  take  counsel  together,  them  shall  the  Lord  destroy:   1$ 
And  the  word  which  ye  shall  speak  shall  not  abide  in  you :   1$ 
For  we  fear  not  your  terror,  neither  are  we  troubled :   1$ 
But  the  Lord  our  God,  he  it  is  to  whom  we  will  ascribe  holiness,

And  if  I  put  my  trust  in  him,  he  shall  be  my  sanctification :  Ц 
I  will  set  my  hope  on  him,  and  through  him  shall  I  be  saved:   Ц 
Lo,  I  and  the  children  whom  God  hath  given  me :  B^

And  when  the  Verses  have  been  sung  by  the  Choirs  alternately,  as  ordered,  there  is 
sung: 

God  is  with  us:  understand,  ye  nations,  and  submit  yourselves:  for  God 
is  with  us. 

Then  both  Choirs  sing,  once:  Glory     .     First  Choir.     For  God  is  with  us. 
Now,  and  ever,  Second  Choir,  For  God  is  with  us. 

Then  both  Choirs.     For  God  is  with  us. 

And  immediately,  the  following  Hymns: 

The  day  is  past;  I  thank  thee,  O  Lord:  Grant  me,  I  entreat  thee,  that 
this  evening  and  this  night  I  fall  into  no  sin ;  and  save  me,  O  Saviour. 

Second  Choir.  Glory  .  .  .  The  day  is  past;  I  sing  praises  unto  thee, 
O  Master.  Grant,  I  entreat  thee,  that  this  evening  and  this  night  I  may

Both  Choirs.  Now,  and  ever,  .  .  The  day  is  past:  I  hymn  thee, 
O  Holy  One.  Grant,  I  entreat  thee,  that  this  evening  and  this  night  I 
may  be  assailed  by  no  temptation;  and  save  me,  O  Saviour. 

The  Choirs,  in  unison:  With  songs  unceasing  the  Bodiless  Powers  of  the 
Cherubim  glorify  thee;  the  six-winged  beings,  the  Seraphim,  with  voices 
perpetual,  extol  thee  exceedingly.  With  thrice-holy  songs,  all  the  Host 
of  the  Angels  laud  thee.  For  thou  art  the  Father  before  all  worlds,  and 
hast  with  thee  thy  Son,  who  also  is  from  everlasting;  and  hast  also  the 
Spirit  of  Life,  coequal  in  honour,  and  showest  forth  the  Trinity  Undivided. 
O  most  holy  Virgin,  Mother  of  God,  and  ye  eye-witnesses  and  servants  of 
the  Word,  with  all  the  company  of  the  Prophets  and  the  Martyrs,  who 
have  attained  unto  life  immortal:  Pray  ye  zealously  for  us  all,  for  all  we 
are  in  dire  distress;  that,  being  delivered  from  the  wiles  of  the  Evil  One,  we 
may  loudly  sing  the  Angelic  Song:  Holy,  Holy,  Holy  Thrice-Holy  Lord, 
have  mercy  upon  us,  and  save  us.     Amen. 

And  immediately,  in  a  lower  voice: 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible: 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  God,  the  only-begotten,  Begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God, 
Begotten,  not  made,  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom  all 
things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came  down 
from  heaven,  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin  Mary, 
And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius  Pilate; 
and  suffered  and  was  buried.  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again,  according 
to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father.  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both  the 
quick  and  the  dead;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end.

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord  and  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth 
from  the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and

Then  straightway  the  All-Holy: 

O  all-holy  Sovereign  L;ady,  Birth-giver  of  God,  pray  for  us  sinners. 
(Thrice.) 

O  all  ye  heavenly  Host  of  Angels  and  Archangels,  pray  for  us  sinners.

Then  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Church  is  invoked:

And  if  a  Feast  be  impending,  then  the  Hymns  for  that  Feast  are  sung.     Otherwise, 
the  following  Hymns  are  used: 

On  Monday  and  Wednesday  Evenings,  Tone  II.: 

Lighten  mine  eyes,  O  Christ-God,  that  I  sleep  not  unto  death;  lest 
mine  enemy  say:  I  have  prevailed  against  him. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Be  thou  the  defender  of  my  soul,  O  God,  for  I  walk  amid  a  multitude  of 
snares.  Deliver  me  from  them  and  save  me,  O  Good  One :  for  thou  lovest 
mankind. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  since,  through  our  manifold  iniquities,  we  have  no  boldness,  do 
thou,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  make  fervent  entreaty  unto  him  who 
was  born  of  thee:  for  the  prayer  of  a  mother  availeth  much  unto  the  be- 
nignity of  the  Master.  Despise  not  the  petitions  of  sinners,  O  All-Pure 
One;  for  gracious  and  mighty  to  save  is  he  who  deigned  to  suffer  for  us. 
(A  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.) 


154  THE  OFFICE  OF  GRAND  COMPLINE 

On  Tuesday  and  Thursday  Evenings  the  following  Hymns  shall  be  sung,  Tone 
VIII.: 

Thou  knowest,  O  Lord  my  Creator,  the  sleepless  vigilance  of  mine  in- 
visible enemies,  and  the  frailty  of  my  miserable  flesh.  Into  thy  hands, 
therefore,  will  I  commit  my  spirit.  Cover  me  with  the  wings  of  thy  good- 
ness, that  I  sleep  not  unto  death ;  and  enlighten  the  eyes  of  my  spiritual 
understanding,  that  I  may  delight  in  thy  divine  words :  and  make  me,  in 
a  time  acceptable  unto  thee,  to  glorify  thee  in  praise,  as  the  only  Good 
One  who  loveth  mankind. 

Verse:  Look  upon  me,  and  give  ear  unto  me,  O  Lord  my  God. 

How  terrible  is  thy  Judgment,  0  Lord,  when  the  angels  stand  round 
about,  and  men  are  led  before  thee;  and  the  books  are  opened,  and  deeds 
are  tried;  and  all  thoughts  are  searched  out.  What  judgment  shall  then 
be  awarded  unto  me,  who  was  conceived  in  sins?  Who  shall  quench  the 
flame  for  me?  Who  shall  enlighten  my  darkness,  if  not  thou,  O  Lord, 
who  showest  mercy  upon  me  because  of  thy  love  towards  mankind? 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Grant  me  tears,  O  God,  as  once  to  the  sinning  woman  of  old :  And  gra- 
ciously vouchsafe  that  I  may  wash  thy  feet  which  delivered  me  from  the 
path  of  straying,  and  that  I  may  offer  unto  thee  an  incense  of  sweet 
savour,  even  a  pure  life,  fashioned  by  my  repentance.  And  so  shall  I, 
also,  hear  thy  voice  which  I  long  for,  saying:  Thy  faith  hath  saved  thee; 
go  in  peace. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

In  that  I  have  in  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  that  hope  which  maketh. 
not  ashamed,  I  shall  be  saved;  in  that  I  possess  thy  intercession,  O  All- 
Pure  One,  I  will  not  fear.  I  will  follow  hard  after  mine  enemies,  and  put 
them  to  flight,  invested  only,  as  it  were  in  a  cuirass,  with  thy  protection 
and  all-powerful  aid,  and  fervently  imploring  I  cry  unto  thee:  O  Lady, 
save  me  by  thy  prayers,  and  raise  me  up  again  from  gloomy  sleep  to 
glorify  thee  in  song,  by  the  might  of  the  Son  of  God,  who  through  thee 
was  made  flesh. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Forty  times.) 

Glory     .     now,  and  ever     .  . 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glori- 
ous than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Bless,  Father,  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Priest.  Through  the  prayers  of  our  holy  Fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us.     Amen. 

Then  shall  this  Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  be  said: 

O  Lord,  Lord,  who  deliverest  us  from  all  the  arrows  that  fly  by  day,  de- 
liver thou  us,  also,  from  all  the  things  that  infest  the  darkness.     Accept 


THE  OFFICE  OF  GRAND  COMPLINE  155 

our  evening  sacrifice,  even  the  lifting-up  of  our  hands.  Grant  that  we 
may  pass  through  the  course  of  the  night  without  sin,  untempted  of  evil 
things;  and  deliver  us  from  every  alarm  and  cowardice  that  cometh  to  us 
from  the  Devil.  Grant  unto  our  souls  contrition,  and  unto  our  minds 
anxiety  concerning  that  strict  searching  out  of  the  thoughts  which  shall 
come  in  thy  dread  and  just  Day  of  Judgment.  Nail  our  flesh  to  the  fear 
of  thee,  and  mortify  our  earthly  members:  that,  in  the  quietness  of  sleep, 
we  may  be  illuminated  by  the  vision  of  thy  judgments.  Remove  from  us, 
also,  every  unseemly  imagination  and  hurtful  carnal  passion.  Raise  us 
up  again  at  the  hour  of  prayer  fortified  in  the  faith,  and  advancing  in  thy 
commandments;  through  the  favour  and  goodness  of  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed  together  with  thine  all-holy,  and  good, 
and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  immediately  the  Priest  shall  exclaim: 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  {Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  li. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me  throughly 
from  my  wickedness,  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I  acknowledge 
my  faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned, 
and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justified  in  thy  say- 
ing, and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold,  I  was  shapen  in  wickedness, 
and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou  requirest  truth  in 
the  inward  parts,  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand  wisdom  secretly. 
Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean ;  thou  shalt  wash 
me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow.  Thou  shalt  make  me  hear  of  joy 
and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may  rejoice.  Turn 
thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds.  Make  me  a  clean 
heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast  me  not  away  from 
thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy  holy  spirit  from  me.  O  give  me  the  com- 
fort of  thy  help  again,  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free  Spirit.  Then  shall  I 
teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked,  and  sinners  shall  be  converted  unto  thee. 
Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou  that  art  the  God  of  my 
health,  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  Thou  shalt  open 
my  lips,  O  Lord,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy  praise.  For  thou  desirest 
no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou  delightest  not  in  burnt- 
offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled  spirit:  a  broken  and  contrite 
heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be  favourable  and  gracious  unto 
Sion:  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem.  Then  shalt  thou  be  pleased  with 
the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with  the  burnt-offerings  and  oblations:  then 
shall  they  offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine  altar.

Psalm  cii. 

Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  let  my  crying  come  unto  thee.  Hide  not 
thy  face  from  me  in  the  time  of  my  trouble ;  incline  thine  ear  unto  me  when 
I  call;  O  hear  me,  and  that  right  soon.  For  my  days  are  consumed  away 
like  smoke,  and  my  bones  are  burnt  up  as  it  were  a  firebrand.  My  heart 
is  smitten  down,  and  withered  like  grass;  so  that  I  forget  to  eat  my  bread. 
For  the  voice  of  my  groaning,  my  bones  will  scarce  cleave  to  my  flesh.  I 
am  become  like  a  pelican  in  the  wilderness,  and  like  an  owl  that  is  in  the 
desert.  I  have  watched,  and.  am  even  as  it  were  a  sparrow,  that  sitteth 
alone  upon  the  house-top.  Mine  enemies  revile  me  all  the  day  long;  and 
they  that  are  mad  upon  me  are  sworn  together  against  me.  For  I  have 
eaten  ashes  as  it  were  bread,  and  mingled  my  drink  with  weeping;  and 
that,  because  of  thine  indignation  and  wrath ;  for  thou  hast  taken  me  up, 
and  cast  me  down.  My  days  are  gone  like  a  shadow,  and  I  am  withered 
like  grass.  But  thou,  O  Lord,  shalt  endure  forever,  and  thy  remembrance 
throughout  all  generations.  Thou  shalt  arise,  and  have  mercy  upon  Sion; 
for  it  is  time  that  thou  have  mercy  upon  her,  yea,  the  time  is  come.  And 
why?  thy  servants  think  upon  her  stones,  and  it  pitieth  them  to  see  her 
in  the  dust.  The  heathen  shall  fear  thy  Name,  O  Lord :  and  all  the  kings 
of  the  earth  thy  majesty;  when  the  Lord  shall  build  up  Sion,  and  when 
his  glory  shall  appear;  when  he  turneth  him  unto  the  prayer  of  the  poor 
destitute,  and  despiseth  not  their  desire.  This  shall  be  written  for  those 
that  come  after,  and  the  people  which  shall  be  born  shall  praise  the  Lord. 
For  he  hath  looked  down  from  his  sanctuary:  out  of  the  heaven  did  the 
Lord  behold  the  earth ;  that  he  might  hear  the  mournings  of  such  as  are  in 
captivity,  and  deliver  the  children  appointed  unto  death ;  that  they  may 
declare  the  Name  of  the  Lord  in  Sion,  and  his  worship  at  Jerusalem;  when 
the  people  are  gathered  together,  and  the  kingdoms  also,  to  serve  the 
Lord.  He  brought  down  my  strength  in  my  journey,  and  shortened  my 
days.  But  I  said,  O  my  God,  take  me  not  away  in  the  midst  of  mine  age; 
as  for  thy  years,  they  endure  throughout  all  generations.  Thou,  Lord,  in 
the  beginning  hast  laid  the  foundation  of  the  earth,  and  the  heavens  are 
the  work  of  thy  hands.  They  shall  perish,  but  thou  shalt  endure:  they 
all  shall  wax  old  as  doth  a  garment;  and  as  a  vesture  shalt  thou  change 
them,  and  they  shall  be  changed;  but  thou  art  the  same,  and  thy  years 
shall  not  fail.  The  children  of  thy  servants  shall  continue,  and  their  seed 
shall  stand  fast  in  thy  sight. 

The  Prayer  of  Manasses,  King  of  Judah. 

O  Lord  Almighty,  thou  God  of  our  fathers,  of  Abraham,  of  Isaac,  and 
of  Jacob,  and  of  their  righteous  seed ;  who  hast  made  heaven  and  earth, 
with  all  the  firmament  thereof;  who  hast  bound  the  sea  with  the  word  of 
thy  commandment;  who  hast  shut  up  the  deep  and  sealed  it  with  thy 
terrible  and  glorious  Name:  All  creatures  fear  thee,  yea,  they  do  tremble 
before  the  presence  of  thy  power;  for  the  majesty  of  thy  glory  cannot  be

borne,  and  not  to  be  resisted  is  the  anger  of  thy  threatening  toward  sin- 
ners; but  thy  merciful  promise  is  unmeasurable  and  unsearchable.  For 
thou  art  the  Lord  most  high,  of  tender  compassion,  long-suffering,  rich  in 
mercy,  and  grievest  over  the  evils  of  men.  Thou,  O  Lord,  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  loving-kindness,  hast  promised  repentance  and  for- 
giveness to  those  who  have  sinned  against  thee,  and  in  the  plenitude  of 
thy  compassions  hast  appointed  repentance  unto  sinners,  that  they  may 
be  saved.  Thou,  therefore,  the  Lord  God  of  Hosts,  hast  not  appointed 
repentance  to  the  just,  to  Abraham,  and  to  Isaac,  and  to  Jacob,  who  have 
not  sinned  against  thee;  but  thou  hast  appointed  repentance  to  me  a 
sinner:  for  my  sins  are  more  in  number  than  the  sands  of  the  sea.  My 
transgressions  are  multiplied,  O  Lord,  my  transgressions  are  multiplied, 
and  I  am  not  worthy  to  behold  and  see  the  height  of  heaven  because  of 
the  multitude  of  mine  iniquities.  I  am  bowed  down  with  many  iron 
bands,  so  that  I  cannot  lift  up  my  head  by  reason  of  my  sins,  neither  have 
I  any  respite:  for  I  have  provoked  thy  wrath,  and  have  done  that  which 
is  evil  in  thy  sight:  I  have  not  done  thy  will,  neither  have  I  kept  thy  com- 
mandments. Now,  therefore,  I  bow  the  knees  of  my  heart,  supplicating 
grace  of  thee.  I  have  sinned,  O  Lord,  I  have  sinned,  and  I  acknowledge 
mine  iniquities:  but  I  humbly  beseech  thee,  forgive  me,  O  Lord,  forgive 
me,  and  destroy  me  not  together  with  mine  iniquities,  neither  preserve 
thou  thy  divine  wrath  against  my  evil  deeds  forever;  neither  condemn  me 
to  the  lower  parts  of  the  earth.  For  thou,  O  God,  art  the  God  of  those 
who  are  penitent ;  and  in  me  wilt  thou  manifest  all  thy  goodness ;  for  thou 
wilt  save  me,  unworthy  though  I  be,  because  of  thy  great  mercy,  and  I 
will  praise  thee  henceforth,  all  the  days  of  my  life.  For  all  the  Host  of 
heaven  doth  sing  thy  praise,  and  thine  is  the  glory,  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen.

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  for  we  have  put  our  trust  in  thee.  Be 
not  exceeding  wroth  with  us,  neither  call  to  mind  our  iniquities;  but  look 
down  upon  us  now,  also,  in  thy  loving-kindness,  and  deliver  us  from  our 
enemies.  For  thou  art  our  God,  and  we  are  thy  people,  we  are  all  the  work

Amen. 

Then:  O  come,  let  us  worship     .  .  (See  page  147.) 

And  then  shall  be  read  (except  when  the  Great  Canon  is  used): 

Psalm  lxx. 
Haste  thee,  O  God,  to  deliver  me;  make  haste  to  help  me,  O  Lord.  Let 
them  be  ashamed  and  confounded  that  seek  after  my  soul;  let  them  be 
turned  backward  and  put  to  confusion  that  wish  me  evil.  Let  them  for 
their  reward  be  soon  brought  to  shame,  that  cry  over  me,  There!  there! 
But  let  all  those  that  seek  thee  be  joyful  and  glad  in  thee:  and  let  all  such 
as  delight  in  thy  salvation  say  alway,  The  Lord  be  praised.  As  for  me,  I 
am  poor  and  in  misery:  haste  thee  unto  me,  O  God.  Thou  art  my  helper, 
and  my  redeemer:  O  Lord,  make  no  long  tarrying. 

Psalm  cxliii. 
Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  consider  my  desire;  hearken  unto  me  for 
thy  truth  and  righteousness'  sake.  And  enter  not  into  judgment  with 
thy  servant;  for  in  thy  sight  shall  no  man  living  be  justified.  For  the 
enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul;  he  hath  smitten  my  life  down  to  the 
ground;  he  hath  laid  me  in  the  darkness,  as  the  men  that  have  been  long 
dead.  Therefore  is  my  spirit  vexed  within  me,  and  my  heart  within  me  is 
desolate.  Yet  do  I  remember  the  time  past:  I  muse  upon  all  thy  works; 
yea,  I  exercise  myself  in  the  works  of  thy  hands.  I  stretch  forth  my 
hands  unto  thee;  my  soul  gaspeth  unto  thee  as  a  thirsty  land.  Hear  me, 
O  Lord,  and  that  soon;  for  my  spirit  waxeth  faint:  hide  not  thy  face  from 
me,  lest  I  be  like  unto  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit.  O  let  me  hear  thy 
loving-kindness  betimes  in  the  morning;  for  in  thee  is  my  trust:  show  thou 
me  the  way  that  I  should  walk  in ;  for  I  lift  up  my  soul  unto  thee.  De- 
liver me,  O  Lord,  from  mine  enemies;  for  I  flee  unto  thee  to  hide  me.

Teach  me  to  do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee;  for  thou  art  my  God:  let  thy 
loving  Spirit  lead  me  forth  into  the  land  of  righteousness.  Quicken  me,  O 
Lord,  for  thy  Name's  sake;  and  for  thy  righteousness'  sake  bring  my  soul 
out  of  trouble.  And  of  thy  goodness  slay  mine  enemies,  and  destroy  all 
them  that  vex  my  soul ;  for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  towards  men. 
We  praise  thee,  we  bless  thee,  we  worship  thee,  we  glorify  thee,  we  give

sins  of  the  world,  receive  our  prayer.  Thou  that  sittest  at  the  right  hand 
of  God,  the  Father,  have  mercy  upon  us.  For  thou  only  art  holy;  thou 
only  art  the  Lord,  O  Jesus  Christ,  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  in  the  glory  of 
God  the  Father.     Amen. 

Every  night  will  I  give  thanks  unto  thee :  and  praise  thy  Name  for  ever

Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge,  from  one  generation  to  another.  I 
said,  Lord,  be  merciful  unto  me:  heal  my  soul,  for  I  have  sinned  against 
thee.  I  flee  unto  thee.  Teach  me  to  do  thy  will;  for  thou  art  my  God. 
For  with  thee  is  the  well  of  life,  and  in  thy  light  shall  we  see  light.  0  con- 
tinue forth  thy  loving-kindness  unto  them  that  know  thee. 

Vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  to  keep  us  this  night  without  sin.  Blessed  art  thou, 
O  Lord,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  and  praised  and  glorified  is  thy  Name 
forever.     Amen. 

Let  thy  mercy  be  upon  us,  O  Lord,  even  as  we  have  set  our  hope  on 
thee.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord ;  teach  me  thy  statutes.  Blessed  art  thou, 
O  Master;  make  me  to  understand  thy  commandments.  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  Holy  One;  enlighten  me  with  thy  precepts. 

Thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  endureth  forever:  O  despise  not  the  works  of  thy 
hands.  To  thee  belongeth  worship,  to  thee  belongeth  praise,  to  thee  be- 
longeth  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen,

And  the  Prayer  of  Supplication  to  the  Most  Holy  Birth-giver  of  God, 

of  Paul,  a  Monk  of  the  Monastery  of  the  Benefactress. 

O  Virgin,  pure,  spotless,  incorrupt,  undefiled,  all-pure;  thou  Bride  of 
God  and  Sovereign  Lady,  who  didst  unite  the  Word  of  God  with  men 
through  thy  most  glorious  birth-giving,  and  hast  yoked  the  apostate 
nature  of  our  race  with  the  heavenly ;  who  art  the  sole  hope  of  the  hopeless, 
and  the  helper  of  the  assailed,  a  speedy  defender  of  those  who  flee  unto 
thee,  and  the  refuge  of  all  Christians:  Hold  not  in  loathing  me,  a  sinner 
and  polluted,  who  have  made  myself  of  no  worth  through  my  shameful 
thoughts,  and  words,  and  deeds,  and  who,  through  slothfulness  of  mind 
have  been  a  slave  to  the  carnal  lusts  of  life.  But,  in  that  thou  art  the 
Mother  of  the  God  who  loveth  mankind,  mercifully  have  compassion  upon 
me,  a  sinner  and  a  prodigal,  and  accept  my  prayer  which  is  offered  unto 
thee  with  lips  impure;  and  exercising  thy  maternal  boldness,  importune 
thou  thy  Son,  who  is  also  our  Master  and  our  Lord,  that  he  will  open  unto 
me  also  the  compassionate  loving-kindness  of  his  goodness,  and  disre- 
garding my  countless  wickednesses,  will  turn  me  again  unto  repentance, 
and  show  me  forth  a  well-skilled  doer  of  his  commandments.  And  be 
thou  ever  present  with  me,  in  that  thou  art  gracious,  and  pitiful,  and  full 
of  loving-kindness:  For  thou  art  a  fervent  Mediatrix  and  Helper  who,  in 
this  present  life,  repellest  the  assaults  of  adversaries,  and  guidest  me  unto 
salvation,  and  at  the  hour  of  death  carest  diligently  for  my  wretched 
soul,  driving  far  from  it  the  dark  forms  of  evil  spirits;  and  in  the  dread 
Judgment  Day  thou  shalt  deliver  me  from  torment  eternal,  and  shalt 
manifest  me  an  heir  of  the  glory  ineffable  of  thy  Son  and  our  God:  All 
which  I  shall  obtain,  O  Lady  and  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  by  thy 
mediation  and  intercession,  through  the  mercy  and  love  toward  mankind 
of  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ, 
to  whom  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  together  with  his  Father, 
who  is  from  everlasting,  and  his  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,

Another  Prayer,  To  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  by  Antiochus,  a  Monk  of  the  Monas- 
tery of  the  Pandect. 

And  grant  unto  us,  O  Master,  as  we  lay  us  down  to  sleep,  repose  both 
of  body  and  of  soul,  and  preserve  us  from  the  gloomy  slumber  of  sin,  and 
from  every  dark  and  nocturnal  sensuality.  Calm  thou  the  impulses  of 
carnal  desires:  quench  the  fiery  darts  of  the  Evil  One  which  are  craftily 
directed  against  us.  Assuage  the  rebellions  of  our  flesh.  Still  our  every 
earthly  and  material  anxiety;  and  vouchsafe  unto  us,  O  God,  a  watchful 
mind,  a  chaste  reason,  a  sober  heart,  sleep  gentle  and  free  from  every 
vision  of  the  Devil ;  and  raise  us  up  again  at  the  hour  of  prayer,  strength- 
ened in  thy  precepts,  and  holding  steadfastly  within  us  the  memory  of  thy 
commandments.  Grant  that  all  the  night  long  we  may  sing  praises  unto 
thee,  and  that  we  may  hymn,  and  bless,  and  glorify  thine  all-honourable

thee,  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Another  Prayer,  by  St.  Ioannikius. 

The  Father  is  my  hope;  the  Son  is  my  refuge;  the  Holy  Spirit  is  my  pro- 
tector.    O  Holy  Trinity,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)     Bless. 

And  immediately  the  Priest  saith,  aloud,  while  we  kneel  humbly: 

O  Master,  great  in  mercy,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God:  through  the 
prayers  of  our  all-pure  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin 
Mary;  through  the  might  of  the  precious  and  life-giving  Cross;  through 
the  prayers  of  the  honourable  Bodiless  Powers  of  Heaven ;  of  the  honour- 
able, glorious  Prophet,  Forerunner  and  Baptist,  John;  of  the  holy,  glori- 
ous and  all-laudable  Apostles ;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  gloriously  trium- 
phant Martyrs;  of  our  venerable  and  God-bearing  Fathers;  of  the  holy, 
righteous  Ancestors  of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna;  and  of  all  thy  Saints: 
Make  our  prayer  acceptable.  Grant  unto  us  remission  of  our  iniquities. 
Hide  us  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings.  Drive  far  from  us  every  foe  and 
adversary-  Give  peace  to  our  life.  Have  mercy  upon  us  and  upon  thy 
world,  O  Lord,  and  save  our  souls,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  merciful  and 
lovest  mankind. 

Then  the  Superior  maketh  a  reverence  to  the  earth  {if  it  be  in  a  monastery),  and  saith 
to  the  Brethren: 

Bless  me,  holy  Fathers.     Pardon  me,  a  sinner. 

And  the  Brethren: 

May  God  pardon  thee,  holy  Father. 

Let  us  pray  for  our  most  Holy  Synod  (or  Patriarch) ;  for  our  Bishop  (or 
Archbishop,  or  Metropolitan),  N.,  for  the  honourable  Presbytery,  the 
Diaconate  in  Christ,  and  for  all  the  clergy  and  the  laity : 

Choir:  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Here  follow  petitions  for  the  Ruler  of  the  Land  and  for  all  the  Authorities,  ac- 
cording to  the  elements  and  nationalities  of  which  the  Parish  is  constituted. 

For  the  welfare  and  strengthening  of  the  Christ-loving  Army  and 
Navy:   E;

For  those  who  hate  us  and  who  love  us :   Ц

Forgive,  O  Lord  who  lovest  man,  those  who  hate  us,  and  those  who  have

ness of  their  sins.  Upon  those  who  have  enjoined  us,  unworthy  though

Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord,  our  fathers  and  brethren  who  have  fallen 
asleep  before  us,  and  give  them  rest  where  the  light  of  thy  countenance 
shall  visit  them.  Remember,  O  Lord,  our  brethren  who  are  in  captivity, 
and  release  them  from  all  the  difficulties  which  beset  them.  Remember, 
O  Lord,  those  who  bring  gifts,  and  the  benefactors  of  thy  holy  churches, 
and  grant  them  those  petitions  which  are  unto  salvation  and  life  eternal. 
Remember,  also,  O  Lord,  us,  thy  humble,  and  sinful,  and  unworthy 
servants,  and  illumine  our  minds  with  the  light  of  thy  wisdom,  and  guide 
us  in  the  way  of  thy  commandments.  Through  the  prayers  of  our  all- 
pure  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  and  of  all  thy 
saints:  For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

THE  NATIVITY  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  BIRTH- 
GIVER  OF  GOD 

(SEPTEMBER  8 — 21   N.S.) 

At  the  Ail-Night  Vigil. 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  VI.  To-day 
hath  God  who  sitteth  on  supersensual  thrones  prepared  for  himself  upon 
earth  a  holy  throne.  He  who  in  wisdom  established  the  heavens  hath,  in 
his  love  toward  mankind,  made  a  living  heaven;  for  from  a  barren  root 
hath  he  made  to  bourgeon  forth  to  us  a  life-bearing  garden,  even  his 
Mother.  Thou  who  art  the  God  of  wonders,  and  the  hope  of  the  hopeless, 
O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.   Amen. 

And  again  the  Stanza:  To-day  hath  God  who  sitteth  .  .  . 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  (Paremii) .  Genesis  xxviii.  10-17 ;  Ezek.  xliii.  27,  xliv.  1-4; 
Prov.  ix.  i-ii. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  VIII.  {by  Patriarch  Sergius).  On  this 
blessed  illustrious  day  of  our  Feast,  let  us  sound  the  spiritual  trumpets: 
for  she  who  is  of  the  seed  of  David  is  born  this  day  as  the  Mother  of  Life, 
dispersing  darkness;  who  also  is  the  renewal  of  Adam  and  the  recall  of 
Eve,  the  fountain  of  incorruption,  and  the  annihilation  of  corruption; 
through  whom,  also,  we  have  become  godlike,  and  have  been  delivered 
from  death.  And  unto  her,  with  Gabriel,  let  us  cry,  O  ye  faithful:  Hail, 
thou  that  art  full  of  grace!  The  Lord  is  with  thee,  for  thy  sake  giving 
unto  us  great  mercy  - 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  IV.  Thy  holy  Nativity, 
O  virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  hath  proclaimed  joy  unto  all  the  universe; 
for  from  thee  is  risen  the  Sun  of  Righteousness,  even  Christ  our  God.  And 
having  destroyed  the  curse,  he  hath  bestowed  a  blessing;  and  having 
brought  Death  to  naught,  he  hath  given  unto  us  life  eternal. 

The  Exaltation  (Velitchdnie).  We  magnify  thee,  O  most  holy  Virgin, 
and  do  homage  to  thy  holy  Parents,  and  exalt  thy  glorious  Nativity. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  I  will  call  to  remem- 
brance thy  name  from  generation  to  generation. 


NATIVITY  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER  OF  GOD       165 

Verse  (Stikh) :   My  heart  is  inditing  of  a  good  matter. 
Verse:  Praise  ye  God  in  his  Saints. 
The  Gospel.  Luke  i.  39-49,  56. 

THE   CANON. 
The  First  Canon.     Tone  II.     (St.  John  of  Damascus.) 

Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  Come.,  O  ye  people,  let  us  sing  a  song  unto 
Christ-God,  who  parted  asunder  the  Sea,  and  guided  through  it  the  na- 
tion which  he  had  brought  forth  from  the  bondage  of  Egypt:  for  glori- 
ously hath  he  been  glorified. 

III.  Establish  us  in  thee,  OLord,  who  through  the  Tree  didst  annihilate 
sin,  and  implant  the  fear  of  thee  in  the  hearts  of  us  who  sing  praises  unto 
thee. 

IV  I  have  heard,  O  Lord,  the  fame  of  thy  dispensation,  and  have 
glorified  thee,  who  alone  lovest  mankind. 

V.  O  thou  who  didst  dispel  the  dim  obscurity  of  the  dark  sayings  in  the 
Scriptures,  and  didst  illumine  the  hearts  of  the  faithful  by  the  advent 
of  truth  through  the  God-Maiden:  Guide  thou  us,  also,  by  thy  light, 

0  Christ. 

VI.  From  within  the  whale  Jonah  cried  unto  the  Lord:  Lead  me  forth 

1  beseech  thee,  from  the  depths  of  Hell;  and  unto  thee,  as  the  deliverer, 
with  the  voice  of  praise,  and  in  the  spirit  of  truth,  I  will  offer  sacrifice. 

VII.  The  bush  which  upon  the  mount  burned  with  fire,  and  the  Chal- 
dsean  furnace  which  dropped  dew,  clearly  foreshadowed  thee,  the  Bride 
of  God :  for,  unconsumed  by  the  flame,  thou  didst  receive  the  immaterial 
Fire  Divine  in  thy  material  womb.  For  which  cause  we  cry  unto  him  who 
was  born  of  thee:  Blessed  be  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 

VIII.  In  the  furnace  of  the  Children  thou  didst,  of  old,  foreshadow  thy 
Mother,  O  Lord,  and  this  foreshadowing  saved  from  the  fire  those  who 
walked  in  the  midst  thereof  unconsumed.  Her  who,  through  thee,  is  man- 
ifested unto  the  ends  of  the  world,  to-day  we  hymn  and  magnify  exceed- 
ingly. 

IX.  Thee,  who  from  thy  Virgin  womb  ineffably  didst  incarnate  God, 
the  Light  which  shone  forth  before  the  Sun  was  made,  and  came  down  to 
us  in  the  flesh,  O  blessed,  all-pure  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify. 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord :  the  Refrains: 
Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  most  glorious  Nativity  of  the  Mother  of  God. 
Magnify,  O  my  soul,  Mary  the  Virgin,  who  of  the  barren  one  was  born. 

At  the  Liturgy. 
The  Introit:  The  Hymn  for  the  Day.     (See  page  164 .) 
The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).     Joachim  and  Anna  were  delivered  from 
the  reproach  of  childlessness,  and  Adam  and  Eve  from  the  corruption  of 
death,  in  thy  holy  Nativity,  O  All-pure  One.     This  do  thy  people  cele-

brate,  being  redeemed  from  the  guilt  of  transgressions,  when  they  cry  unto 
thee:  The  barren  giveth  birth  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  the  Nourisher 
of  our  Life. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  My  soul  doth  magnify  the 
Lord,  and  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in  God  my  Saviour. 

Verse  (Stikh):  For  he  hath  regarded  the  lowliness  of  his  handmaiden. 
For  behold,  from  henceforth  all  generations  shall  call  me  blessed. 

The  Epistle.  Phil.  ii.  5-1 1. 

Alleluia.  (Tone  VIII.)  Hearken,  O  Daughter,  and  behold,  and  in- 
cline thine  ear. 

Verse:  A  rich  nation  shall  worship  before  thy  presence. 

The  Gospel.  Luke  x.  38-42,  xi.  27,  28. 

The  Hymn  in  place  of:  Meet  is  it:  The  Ninth  Theme-Song  of  the  Second 
Canon.  Alien  to  mothers  is  virginity,  and  strange  unto  virgins  is  child- 
birth; in  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  were  both  achieved.  Wherefore  all 
we  nations  of  the  earth  unceasingly  do  magnify  thee. 

The  Communion  Hymn.  I  will  take  the  cup  of  salvation,  and  call  upon 
the  Name  of  the  Lord. 


THE  ELEVATION  OF  THE  PRECIOUS  CROSS  OF 

THE  LORD 

(SEPTEMBER  14  —  27  N.S.      A  STRICT  FAST.) 

At  the  All- Night  Vigil. 

The  Stanza  {Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  VI.  The  Cross 
being  set  up,  doth  command  every  created  being  to  sing  the  most  pure 
Passion  of  him  who  was  lifted  up  thereon.  For  having  upon  the  same 
slain  him  who  had  slain  us,  he  endowed  with  life  those  who  were  slain,  and 
adorned  them,  and  vouchsafed  that  they  might  dwell  in  heaven,  forasmuch 
as  he  is  compassionate,  through  the  rich  abundance  of  his  goodness. 
Wherefore,  rejoicing,  let  us  exalt  his  Name,  and  magnify  his  exceeding 
condescension.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  come,  all  ye  nations,  let  us  adore  the  blessed  Tree,  through  which  the 
righteousness  eternal  hath  come  to  pass:  for  he  who  beguiled  our  fore- 
father Adam  with  the  tree  is  himself  beguiled  by  the  Cross,  and  he  who, 
like  a  tyrant,  did  lord  it  over  that  which  the  King  had  fashioned,  falleth, 
being  overthrown  by  a  downfall  strange.  The  poison  of  the  serpent  is 
washed  away  by  the  blood  of  God,  and  the  curse  of  just  condemnation  is 
abolished,  in  that  the  Righteous  One  hath  been  condemned  by  unright- 
eous judgment:  for  it  was  meet  that  the  tree  should  be  healed  by  the  Tree, 
and  that  by  the  passion  of  the  Passionless  One  upon  the  Tree,  the  passions 
of  the  condemned  one  should  be  destroyed.  But  glory,  O  Christ  our 
King,  unto  thy  wise  providence  to  usward,  whereby  thou  hast  saved  all 
men,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  good  and  lovest  mankind. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  {Paremii).  Exodus  xv.  22-27,  xvi.  1;  Prov.  iii.  11-18; 
Isaiah  lx.  11-16. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  I.  To-day,  of  a  truth,  hath  the  sa- 
credly prophetic  saying  of  David  received  its  fulfilment;  for  lo!  we  visibly 
bow  down  before  the  footstool  of  thine  all-spotless  feet,  and  putting  our 
trust  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings,  O  all-bountiful  One,  we  cry  aloud 
unto  thee:  Let  the  light  of  thy  countenance  be  showed  upon  us.  Exalt 
thou  the  horn  of  thine  Orthodox  people  through  the  Elevation  of  thy 
precious  Cross,  O  greatly  merciful  Christ. 

The  Hymn  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  I.  O  Lord,  save  thy  people,  and  bless 
thine  inheritance,  granting  victory  over  enemies  unto  our  Ruler,  N.,  and 
through  thy  Cross  preserving  thine  Estate.    {Thrice.) 


£68        ELEVATION  OF  THE  PRECIOUS  CROSS  OF  THE  LORD 

The  Exaltation  (Velitchdnie) .  We  magnify  thee,  O  life-giving  Christ, 
a.nd  do  homage  to  thy  holy  Cross,  whereby  thou  hast  saved  us  from  the 
works  of  the  enemy 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  All  the  ends  of  the  earth 
have  seen  the  salvation  of  our  God. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  Sing  unto  the  Lord  a  new  song,  for  the  Lord  hath  done 
marvellous  things. 

Verse:  Praise  ye  God  in  his  Saints.  Let  everything  that  hath  breath 
praise  the  Lord. 

The  Gospel.  John  xii.  28-36. 

THE   CANON. 

The  First  Canon.     Tone  VIII.     (St.  Cosmas  of  Maium.) 

Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  Moses,  having  with  his  rod  made  a  long 
line,  divided  the  Red  Sea  for  Israel  journeying  on  foot;  and  having  again 
struck  the  same  with  a  transverse  blow,  thus  tracing  the  Cross  which  is 
the  weapon  invincible,  he  united  it  against  the  armies  of  Pharaoh.  Where- 
fore we  sing  unto  Christ  our  God,  for  he  hath  been  glorified. 

III.  The  Rod  is  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  a  mystery;  for  by  its  bud- 
ding-forth  it  designated  the  Priest;  and  in  the  Church,  which  before  was 
barren,  there  now  hath  budded  forth  the  Tree  of  the  Cross  for  her  power 
and  strengthening. 

IV.  I  have  given  heed  to  the  mystery  of  thy  dispensation,  O  Lord,  I 
have  understood  thy  works,  and  have  glorified  thy  divinity. 

V  O  Tree  thrice  blessed,  whereon  was  crucified  Christ  our  King  and 
our  Lord !  Through  thee  he  is  fallen  who  by  a  tree  did  beguile,  having 
himself  been  beguiled  by  Him  who  was  nailed  upon  thee  in  the  flesh,  even 
God,  who  granteth  peace  unto  our  souls. 

VI.  Jonah,  when  he  stretched  forth  his  arms  in  the  form  of  a  cross 
within  the  belly  of  the  sea-monster,  did  clearly  typify  the  Redeeming 
Suffering;  and  when  he  came  forth  thence  after  three  days,  he  imaged 
forth  by  anticipation  the  supernatural  Resurrection  of  Christ-God,  who 
was  crucified  in  the  flesh,  and  hath  illumined  the  world  by  his  rising  on  the 
third  day. 

VII.  The  mad  behest  of  the  impious  tyrant  breathing  forth  threats 
and  godless  blasphemies  troubled  the  people:  yet  neither  the  brutal  rage 
nor  the  devouring  fire  terrified  the  Three  Children;  but  when,  as  they 
stood  amid  the  flames,  a  dew-bearing  breath  was  wafted  against  it,  they 
sang:  Blessed  be  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers,  exceedingly  praised,  and  our 
God! 

VIII.  O  Children,  in  number  equal  to  the  Trinity!  Bless  ye  God  the 
Father,  the  Creator;  sing  ye  the  Word  who  came  down  and  turned  the 
fire  into  dew ;  and  magnify  ye  the  Spirit  all-holy,  who  giveth  life  unto  all 
men,  unto  all  the  ages. 


ELEVATION  OF  THE  PRECIOUS  CROSS  OF  THE  LORD         169 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord:  the  Refrains: 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  all-precious  Cross  of  the  Lord. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  Elevation  of  the  life-giving  Cross  of  the  Lord. 

IX.  Thou  art  the  mystical  Paradise,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  though 
untitled  didst  bud  forth  Christ,  by  whom  the  life-bearing  Tree  of  the 
Cross  was  planted  upon  earth.  For  which  cause,  now,  at  its  Elevation, 
adoring  it,  we  magnify  thee. 

While  the  Canon  is  being  sung,  the  Senior  Priest  putteth  on  all  his  vestments,  and 
after  the  Great  Glory  (Glory  be  to  God  on  high)  hath  been  sung  slowly  and  melodi- 
ously, and  he 'hath  censed  all  about  the  Altar  whereon  lieth  the  precious  Cross, 
while:  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty:  is  being  chanted:  he  placeth  the  Cross  on  his 
head,  and  making  the  circuit  of  the  Altar  therewith,  preceded  by  a  Taper-bearer ,  he 
halteth  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door,  and  having  proclaimed:  Wisdom,  O  believers! 
he  goeth  to  the  folding- stand,  which  is  in  the  middle  of  the  Temple,  while  the  Choir 
chanteth  the  Hymn:  O  Lord,  save  thy  people:  After  this,  the  Priest  censeth  round 
about  the  Cross,  and  having  made  the  customary  reverences,  he  beginneth:  Thy 
Cross  do  we  adore,  O  Master,  and  thy  holy  Resurrection  do  we  glorify.  (Thrice.) 
The  Choir  also  singeth  this  thrice;  and  the  Stanza,  in  Tone  VIII.: 

To-day  is  the  Master  of  creation  and  the  Lord  of  glory  nailed  upon  the 
Cross,,  and  is  pierced  in  the  side,  and  of  gall  and  vinegar  doth  the  Sweet- 
ness of  the  Church  partake.  With  a  crown  of  thorns  is  he  invested  who 
covereth  the  heavens  with  clouds,  and  with  the  robe  of  scorn  is  he  endued; 
and  he  who  with  his  hand  did  fashion  man  is  smitten  by  a  human  hand. 
Hewhoclotheth  the  heavens  with  clouds  is  beaten  upon  his  shoulders,  and 
receiveth  spitting  and  wounds,  indignities  and  buffetings  in  the  face;  and 
he,  my  Redeemer  and  my  Saviour,  doth  endure  all  these  things  for  the 
sake  of  me,  the  accursed,  that  He  may  save  the  world  from  guile,  foras- 
much as  he  is  compassionate. 

Then  the  Litanies;  and  the  Benediction:  May  Christ,  our  true  God, 
through  the  prayers  of  his  most  pure  Mother;  through  the  might  of  the 
precious  and  life-giving  Cross:  and  so  forth,  as  usual. 

At  the  Liturgy. 

In  place  of:  Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul: 

Antiphon  I.,  Tone  II. 

Verse  1 :  O  God,  my  God,  hear  me:  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 
Refrain.  Through  the  prayers  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  O  Saviour, 

save  us.

THE  ENTRANCE  INTO  (PRESENTATION  IN)  THE 
TEMPLE  OF  OUR  MOST  HOLY  LADY,  THE 
BIRTH-GIVER  OF  GOD  AND  EVER-VIRGIN  MARY 

(NOVEMBER  21  — DECEMBER  4  N.S.) 

At  the  All- Night  Vigil  Service. 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  I.  To-day  let 
us  faithful  exult,  singing  unto  the  Lord  in  psalms  and  songs,  and  doing 
honour  unto  his  holy  Tabernacle,  the  Ark  imbued  with  life,  which  con- 
taineth  the  uncontainable  Word:  for  in  wise  supernatural  is  she  brought 
unto  the  Lord,  being  still  of  tender  age  in  the  flesh,  and  Zacharias,  the 
High  Priest,  doth  with  joy  receive  her,  as  the  abode  of  God.     {Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

After  thy  nativity,  O  Lady,  Bride  of  God,  thou  didst  come  into  the 
temple  of  the  Lord,  as  one  consecrated,  to  be  reared  in  the  Holy  of  Holies. 
Then,  also,  was  Gabriel  sent  unto  thee,  O  all-undefiled  One,  bearing 
nourishment  unto  thee.  All  the  powers  of  Heaven  were  amazed  when 
they  beheld  the  Holy  Spirit  take  up  its  abode  in  thee.  Wherefore,  O  most 
pure  and  undented  Mother  of  God,  who  art  glorified  in  heaven  and  on 
earth,  save  thou  our  race.

containeth  God,  even  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  brought  into  the  temple  of 
the  Lord,  and  Zacharias  receive th  the  same:  To-day  doth  the  Holy  of 
Holies  rejoice,  and  the  Angelic  Choir  doth  mystically  triumph.  With 
them  also  keeping  festival  to-day,  let  us  cry  aloud  with  Gabriel:  Hail, 
thou  that  art  full  of  grace !     The  Lord  most  merciful  is  with  thee. 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropar).  To-day  is  the  foreshadowing  of  the 
beneficence  of  God  which  is  to  come,  and  the  heralding  of  man's  salvation. 
The  Virgin  is  clearly  manifested  in  the  temple  of  God,  and  in  anticipation

THE  CANON. 
The  First  Canon.     Tone  IV.     (The  Blessed  George.) 

Theme-Songs  {Irmosi).  I.  I  will  open  my  mouth,  and  it  shall  be  filled 
with  the  Spirit,  and  will  utter  a  saying  to  the  Queen-Mother;  I  will 
reveal  myself,  as  one  keeping  high  festival,  and  with  joy  will  I  sing  her 
Presentation. 

III.  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  Fountain  living  and  inexhaustible!  Spirit- 
ually establish  thou  those  who  hymn  thee,  convoked  in  a  festival  choir, 
and  vouchsafe  unto  them  crowns  of  glory  for  the  sake  of  thine  august 
Presentation. 

IV.  As  he  contemplated  the  unfathomable  counsel  of  God  concerning 
the  incarnation  by  a  Virgin,  of  thee,  the  Most  High,  Habakkuk  the 
Prophet  cried  aloud :  Glory  to  thy  power,  O  Lord ! 

V  All  creation  marvelled  at  thine  august  Presentation;  for  thou,  O 
Virgin  who  knewest  not  wedlock,  didst  enter  into  the  temple  of  God  as 
the  Temple  most  pure,  giving  peace  unto  all  those  who  sing  thy  praises. 

VI.  In  celebration  of  this  divine  and  all-honourable  feast  of  the  Mother 
of  God,  come,  O  ye  godly -minded,  let  us  clap  our  hands  and  glorify  God, 
who  was  born  of  her. 

VII.  The  godly-minded  ones  obeyed  not  the  creature  rather  than  the 
Creator,  but  valiantly  trampling  under  foot  the  threatened  fire,  they  re- 
joiced in  song,  saying:  Blessed  be  thou,  O  Lord  and  God  of  our  fathers,  ex- 
ceedingly praised. 

VIII.  Hearken,  O  Maiden,  Virgin  pure!  Let  Gabriel  announce  the 
true  will  of  the  Most  High,  which  was  from  of  old.  Make  thou  ready  to 
receive  God;  for  through  thee  the  Uncontainable  hath  dwelt  among  men: 
For  which  cause  I  cry  aloud  with  joy:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye 
the  Lord ! 

IX.  Let  no  hand  profane  in  any  wise  touch  the  living  Ark  of  God;  but 
let  the  lips  of  the  faithful  unceasingly  chanting  the  Salutation  of  the 
Angel  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  cry  aloud  with  rejoicing:  Thou  art,  in 
very  truth,  higher  than  all  men,  O  Virgin  pure! 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord :  the  Refrains: 

The  Angels  marvelled  when  they  beheld  the  Presentation  of  the  All-

Virgin:  for  with  glory  hath  she  entered  into  the  Holy  of  Holies.

how  she  who  was  well-pleasing  unto  God  did  enter  into  the  Holy  of  Holies. 


ENTRANCE  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER  OF  GOD      173 

Ye  Angels,  with  the  Saints,  leap  for  joy!  Ye  Virgins,  sing  together 
with  exultation!  For  the  God-Maiden  hath  entered  into  the  Holy  of 
Holies. 

O  ye  Angels  and  men,  let  us  magnify  the  Virgin  in  Hymns:  for  in  god- 
like wise  hath  she  entered  into  the  Holy  of  Holies. 

At  the  Liturgy.

most  precious  Bridal-chamber  and  Virgin,  the  Treasure-house  of  the  glory

grace  which  is  in  the  Spirit  Divine ;  whom  also  the  Angels  of  God  do  cele- 
brate in  song:  This  is  the  Abode  of  Heaven.

THE  NATIVITY  OF  CHRIST  (CHRISTMAS) 

(DECEMBER  25 — JANUARY  7  N.S.) 

The  faithful  prepare  themselves  for  this  great  Feast  by  a  prolonged  Fast,  which  be- 
ginneth  on  November  15,  and  is  called  the  Christmas  Fast,  or  the  Fast  of  St.  Philip. 
The  Eve  of  the  Feast  (Sotchelnik)  is  dedicated  to  a  specially  strict  abstinence. 

On  Christmas  Eve  the  customary  festival  Compline  service  is  celebrated.  If  the  Eve 
falleth  on  any  day  except  Saturday  or  Sunday,  then  on  the  morning  of  that  day  the 
Imperial  Hours  are  read,  and,  later  on,  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  is  cele- 
brated, preceded  by  Vespers.  But  if  the  day  before  the  Feast  be  Saturday  or  Sun- 
day, then  the  Imperial  Hours  are  read  on  Friday,  while  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John 
Chrysostom  is  celebrated  on  the  preceding  day  (Sotchelnik) .  If  the  Liturgy  of  St. 
Basil  the  Great  be  used  on  the  preceding  day  (Sotchelnik)  then  on  the  Feast  of  the 
Nativity  itself  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  is  used;  and  contrariwise. 

The  other  general  differences  of  this  festival  service  are  as  followeth:  Matins  are  pre- 
ceded, not  by  Vespers,  but  by  Grand  Compline  :  and  after  the  Liturgy,  on  the  day 
of  the  Feast,  a  service  of  thanksgiving  is  celebrated. 

The  Imperial  Hours,*  to  precede  Christmas. 

In  addition  to  many  of  the  Prayers  and  so  forth  which  are  used  in  the  daily  Hours, 
and  the  Christmas  Hymns,  the  following  are  read: 

First  Hour.  Psalms  v.,  xlv.,  xlvi.  The  Parable  (Paremiyd) .  Micah 
v.  2-4.     The  Epistle.     Heb.  i.  1-12.     The  Gospel.     Matt.  i.  18-25. 

Third  Hour.  Psalms  lxvii.,  lxxxvii.,  li.  The  Parable  (Paremiyd). 
Jer.  (Baruch  iii.  36-38,  iv.  1-4).  The  Epistle.  Gal.  iii.  23-29.  The 
Gospel.     Luke  ii.  1-20. 

Sixth  Hour.  Psalms  lxxii.,  cxxxii.,  xci.  The  Parable  (Paremiyd). 
Isaiah  vii.  10-16,  viii.  1-4,  9,  10.  The  Epistle.  Heb.  i.  Ю-14,  ii.  1-3. 
The  Gospel.     Matt.  ii.  1-12. 

Ninth  Hour.     Psalms  ex.,  cxi.,  lxxxvi. 

Then  Many  Years  are  proclaimed  for  the  Ruler,  the  Patriarch,  the  Holy  Synod,  the 
Bishop,  the  Orthodox  Patriarchs  of  Constantinople,  Alexandria,  Antioch  and 
Jerusalem,  and  others;  and  the  Choir  respondeth:  Many  years! 

ON  THE  DAY  BEFORE  CHRISTMAS 

At  the  Vespers  which  immediately  precede  the  Liturgy,  the  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for: 
Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  II. 

O  come,  let  us  rejoice  in  the  Lord,  as  we  declare  this  present  mystery 
The  partition  wall  of  disunion  hath  been  destroyed,  the  flaming  sword  is 
turned  back,  and  the  Cherubim  withdraw  from  the  Tree  of  Life,  and  I 
partake  of  the  food  of  Paradise,  whence,  because  of  disobedience,  I  was 
expelled.  For  the  Image  Immutable  of  the  Father,  the  Image  of  his 
Eternity,  taketh  the  form  of  a  servant,  having  come  forth  from  a  Mother 

*  The  Emperors  of  Byzantium  were  wont  to  attend  the  Hours  on  certain  of  the  great 
Feasts  of  the  Church,  which  received  their  name  of  "the  Imperial  Hours"  from  that  cir- 
cumstance, as  well  as  from  their  extraordinary  splendour  and  importance. 


THE  NATIVITY  OF  CHRIST  175 

unwedded,  yet  having  suffered  no  change:  for  that  which  he  was  that  he 
remaineth,  being  very  God;  and  that  which  he  was  not  he  hath  assumed, 
becoming  very  man  because  of  his  love  toward  mankind.  Unto  him  let 
us  cry  aloud:  O  God,  who  wast  born  of  a  Virgin,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
{Twice.) 

When  Augustus  reigned  alone  upon  the  earth,  the  polygarchy  of  men 
came  to  an  end :  and  when  thou  didst  become  incarnate  of  the  Pure  One, 
the  polytheism  of  idols  was  annulled.  Under  one  earthly  sway  were  the 
cities,  and  in  one  dominion  of  the  Godhead  did  the  Gentiles  believe.  By 
the  command  of  Caesar  were  the  people  inscribed;  and  we  faithful  have 
been  inscribed  with  the  name  of  the  Godhead,  of  thee  our  God,  who  hast 
become  man.     Great  is  thy  mercy.     O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Entrance  is  made  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  the  Hymn:  O  gladsome 
radiance ! 

The  Gradual  {Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  (Paremii).  Gen.  i.  1-13.  Num.  xxiv.  2,  3,  5-9,  17,  18; 
Micah  iv  6,  7,  v  2-4;  Isaiah  xi.  1-10;  Jer.  (Baruch  iii.  36-38,  iv.  1-4); 
Dan.  ii.  31-36,  44-46;  Isaiah  ix.  6,  7,  vii.  10-15,  viii.  1-4,  9-1 1. 

The  Little  Litany:  Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  :  with  the  Exclama- 

tion: For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to 
the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

Thou  art  my  Son,  this  day  have  I  begotten  thee. 

Verse  {Stikh):  Ask  of  me,  and  I  will  give  the  heathen  for  thine  inheri- 
tance, and  the  uttermost  parts  of  the  earth  for  thy  possession.

The  Gospel.  Luke  ii.  1-20. 

CHRISTMAS  EVE. 

Compline  and  Matins. 

Compline  is  read  in  the  usual  order,  with  the  Hymns  and  Collect-Hymn  of  the  Feast 
in  place  of  the  ordinary  ones.  After:  Glory  be  to  God  on  high :  hath  been  read,  the 
Clergy  come  forth  to  the  centre  of  the  Temple,  and  perform  the  Litiyd,  with  the 
Blessing  of  the  Loaves. 

The  Stanzas  {Stikhiri)  of  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  I.  Let  heaven  and  earth  to- 
day prophetically  exult,  and  let  Angels  and  men  spiritually  rejoice:  for 
God  hath  revealed  himself  in  the  flesh  unto  those  who  were  in  darkness  and 
sat  in  the  shadow,  and  hath  been  born  of  a  Virgin.  The  cavern  and  the 
manger  have  received  him;  Shepherds  proclaim  the  marvel,  and  Magi 
from  the  Orient  bring  gifts  unto  Bethlehem.  And  we,  also,  with  lips  un- 
worthy, do  bring  unto  him  praise  in  Angelic  wise:  Glory  be  to  God  on

high,  and  on  earth  peace:  for  the  Hope  of  the  nations  is  come,  and  having 
come  hath  saved  us  from  bondage  to  the  enemy 

The  Hymn  at  the  Blessing  of  the  Loaves,  and:  God  is  the  Lord :  Tone  IV 
Thy  Nativity,  O  Christ  our  God,  hath  arisen  upon  the  world  as  the  light 
of  wisdom.     For  at  it,  they  who  worshipped  the  stars  were,  by  a  Star, 
taught  to  adore  thee,  the  Sun  of  Righteousness,  and  to  know  thee,  the 
Orient  from  on  high.     O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Exaltation  of  the  Feast.  We  magnify  thee,  O  Life-giving  Christ,  who 
for  our  sakes  now  art  born  in  the  flesh  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  unwedded  and 
most  pure. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  Out  of  the  womb,  before 
the  morning  star,  have  I  begotten  thee.  The  Lord  sweareth  and  will  not 
repent. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  The  Lord  said  unto  my  Lord :  Sit  thou  at  my  right  hand 
until  I  make  thine  enemies  thy  footstool. 

The  Gospel.  Matt.  i.  18-25. 

THE   CANON. 
In  Tone  I.    (Composed  by  St.  Cosmas  of  Maium,  about  760.) 

Canticle  I. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Christ  is  born:  extol  him!  Christ  from  heaven: 
go  to  meet  him!  Christ  on  earth:  be  ye  lifted  up!  Sing  unto  the  Lord, 
all  the  whole  earth,  and  praise  him  in  song  with  joy,  O  ye  people:  For  he 
hath  glorified  himself. 

1$  Glory  to  thee,  O  our  God;  glory  to  thee. 

Hymns  {Tropari).  Man  who,  being  made  in  the  image  of  God,  had  be- 
come corrupt  through  sin,  and  was  full  of  vileness,  and  had  fallen  away 
from  the  better  life  divine,  doth  the  wise  Creator  restore  anew:  For  he  hath 
glorified  himself. 

When  the  Creator  beheld  man,  whom  he  had  made  with  his  hands, 
about  to  perish,  he  bowed  the  heavens  and  came  down;  and  was  endued 
with  man's  nature  in  very  truth,  becoming  incarnate  of  a  Virgin  divinely 
pure:  For  he  hath  glorified  himself. 

The  Wisdom,  Word,  and  Might,  the  Son  and  Effulgence  of  the  Father, 
Christ  our  God,  without  the  knowledge  of  the  supra -mundane  Powers 
and  the  Powers  of  the  earth,  is  become  incarnate  and  hath  renewed  us: 
For  he  hath  glorified  himself. 

Canticle  III. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Unto  the  Son,  who,  in  wise  immortal,  was  born  of 
the  Father  before  all  the  ages,  and  in  these  latter  days  is  become  incar- 
nate without  seed  of  a  Virgin,  Christ  our  God,  let  us  cry  aloud:  O  Lord, 
who  hast  exalted  our  horn,  holy  art  thou! 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Adam,  mortal,  made  of  clay,  yet  a  participant  of  the 
divine  inspiration,  who  had  become  subject  to  corruption  through  a

woman's  seduction,  when  he  beheld  Christ  sprung  from  a  woman,  ex- 
claimed: Holy  art  thou,  O  Lord,  who  for  my  sake  hast  made  thyself  like 
unto  me. 

O  Christ,  who  hast  conformed  thyself  unto  our  base,  mortal  mould, 
and  by  that  participation  in  our  lowly  flesh  hast  imparted  unto  us  a  share 
of  the  nature  divine;  who,  though  thou  didst  become  earthborn,  yet  didst 
remain  still  God,  and  hast  exalted  our  horn:  Holy  art  thou,  O  Lord. 

Rejoice,  O  Bethlehem,  which  art  King  over  the  princes  of  Judah;  for  he 
who  feedeth  Israel  and  is  borne  on  the  shoulders  of  the  Cherubim  is  visi- 
bly come  forth  from  thee;  and  he  who  exalteth  our  horn  is  enthroned  over 
all. 

Canticle  IV 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Rod  of  the  Root  of  Jesse  and  its  Flower, 
from  a  Virgin  didst  thou  bud  forth,  O  most-lauded  Christ.  From  the 
Mount  covered  with  dense  shadow  art  thou  come,  being  incarnate  of  a 
Maid  who  knew  not  man,  O  thou  Immaterial  One  and  God:  Glory  to  thy 
might,  O  Lord. 

Hymns  (Tr  opart).  Thou,  O  Christ,  the  Expectation  of  the  nations, 
whom  Jacob  did  foretell  of  old,  art  risen  from  the  tribe  of  Judah,  and  art 
come  to  annihilate  the  power  of  Damascus,  and  the  spoils  of  Samaria,  re- 
placing error  with  truth  acceptable  to  God:  Glory  to  thy  might,  O  Lord. 

By  thy  rising  as  a  Star  from  Jacob,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  fill  with  joy  the 
wise  initiates  in  the  word  of  Balaam  the  Prophet  of  old,  the  Watchers  of 
the  Stars,  who  were  led  unto  thee  as  the  first-fruits  of  the  Gentiles,  and 
didst  manifestly  receive  them:  Glory  to  thy  might,  O  Lord. 

Like  the  rain  upon  the  fleece,  and  like  drops  of  dew  falling  upon  the 
earth,  O  Christ,  didst  thou  descend  into  the  Virgin's  womb.  Ethiopia  and 
Tarshish,  the  Isles  of  Araby,  and  Sheba  of  the  Midians,  the  Rulers  of  all 
the  earth,  fell  down  in  adoration  before  thee,  O  Saviour:  Glory  to  thy 
might,  O  Lord. 

Canticle  V. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  O  God  of  peace,  the  Father  of  mercies,  thou  hast 
sent  unto  us  the  Angel  of  thy  Great  Council,  who  giveth  peace:  wherefore 
we,  in  that  we  have  been  led  unto  the  light  of  godly  wisdom,  waking  right 
early  from  the  night,  do  sing  praises  unto  thee,  O  thou  who  lovest  man- 
kind. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  In  obedience  to  the  command  of  Csesar,  O  Christ, 
thou  didst  enroll  thyself  among  the  slaves,  and  didst  set  free  us  who  were 
slaves  of  the  enemy  and  of  sin ;  and  didst  make  thyself  a  beggar,  in  every 
way  like  unto  us ;  and  through  that  same  union  and  community  didst  ren- 
der the  mortal  divine. 

Lo,  a  Virgin,  as  it  was  foretold  of  old,  having  conceived  in  her  womb, 
hath  brought  forth  God  incarnate,  yet  remaineth  Virgin  still.  Let  us 
sinners,  in  that  we  have  become  reconciled  unto  God  through  her,  magnify 
her  in  song  as  the  true  Birth-giver  of  the  Lord. 


17s  THE  NATIVITY  OF  CHRIST 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  sea-monster  cast  forth  Jonah  like  an  infant 
from  its  belly  unharmed  as  it  had  swallowed  him.  And  when  the  Word 
took  up  his  abode  in  a  Virgin,  and  was  made  flesh,  He  came  forth  pre- 
serving her  undented.  For  in  that  He  Himself  suffered  not  corruption, 
He  preserved  unharmed  her  who  bare  Him. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Christ  our  God,  whom  the  Father  begat  of  his  own 
loins  before  the  morning  star,  is  come  in  the  flesh.  He  who  ruleth  the 
most  pure  Powers  lieth  in  a  manger  of  dumb  beasts,  and  is  wrapped  in 
swaddling-bands;  yet  doth  he  loose  the  thick-entangled  bonds  of  trans- 
gression. 

Born  of  Adam's  nature  and  given  unto  the  faithful  as  a  little  child  is  the 
Son:  yet  he  is  also  the  Father  and  the  Ruler  of  the  world  to  come,  and  is 
called  the  Angel  of  the  Great  Council.  He  is  the  mighty  God  who  ruleth 
the  Universe  by  his  power. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk). 

To-day  a  Virgin  bringeth  forth  the  Super-substantial,  and  earth  offereth 
a  cavern  to  the  Unapproachable;  Angels  together  with  the  Shepherds 
sing  praises;  the  Wise  Men  journey  on  with  the  Star.  For',  for  our  sakes. 
God,  who  is  before  all  the  ages,  is  born  a  little  Child. 

Ikos. 

Bethlehem  hath  opened  Eden:  O  come,  let  us  gaze!  We  have  found 
nourishment  in  a  secret  place:  O  come,  let  us  receive  the  things  of  Para- 
dise within  the  cavern !  There  hath  appeared  the  Root  Unwatered  which 
buddeth  forth  remission.  There  hath  been  found  the  Well  Undigged, 
from  which  David  of  old  longed  that  he  might  drink.  There  a  Virgin 
hath  brought  forth  a  Child;  and  straightway  the  thirst  of  Adam  and  of 
David  hath  been  assuaged.  Wherefore  let  us  go  unto  him  where  He  is 
born  a  little  Child,  yet  is  God  before  the  ages. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  The  youths  reared  together  in  godliness,  despis- 
ing the  unrighteous  command,  were  not  terrified  by  the  threatened  fire, 
but  standing  in  the  midst  of  the  flames  did  sing:  O  God  of  our  fathers, 
blessed  art  thou. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  The  shepherds  skilled  upon  the  tuneful  pipes  beheld 
a  revelation  marvellous  of  light;  for  the  glory  of  the  Lord  shone  round 
about  them,  and  the  Angel  proclaimed:  Sing  praises,  for  Christ  is  born. 
O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art  thou. 

Suddenly,  at  the  word  of  the  Angel,  the  Heavenly  Hosts  began  to  cry 
aloud :  Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  toward 
men;  Christ  hath  shone  forth:  O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art  thou! 

What  meaneth  this  saying?  spake  the  shepherds:  Let  us  go,  let  us  gaze 
upon  that  which  is  come  to  pass,  upon  Christ  divine.     And  when  they 


THE  NATIVITY  OF  CHRIST  i79 

were  come  unto  Bethlehem,  they  fell  down  in  worship  before  him,  to- 
gether with  her  who  had  given  him  birth,  singing:  O  God  of  our  fathers, 
blessed  art  thou. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  dew-shedding,  fiery  furnace  imaged  forth 
the  type  of  a  marvellous  wonder:  for  its  flames  scorched  not  the  Holy 
Children  whom  it  had  received,  even  as  the  fire  of  the  Godhead  scorched 
not  the  Virgin  when  it  entered  into  her  womb.  Therefore  let  us  raise  the 
song:  Let  all  creation  bless  the  Lord,  and  magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  The  Daughter  of  Babylon  doth  bear  away  unto 
herself  the  children  of  David  as  captives,  out  of  Zion :  but  she  sendeth  her 
children,  the  Magi,  bearing  gifts,  to  do  homage  unto  the  Daughter  of 
David,  who  had  received  within  her  God:  wherefore,  chanting  songs  of 
praise,  let  us  sing:  Let  all  creation  bless  the  Lord,  and  magnify  him  unto 
all  the  ages. 

Grief  put  aside  the  instruments  of  song;  for  the  children  of  Zion  sang 
not  in  alien  lands.  But  Christ,  in  that  he  hath  shone  forth  in  Bethlehem, 
setteth  free  every  error,  and  the  musical  harmony  of  Babylon.  Where- 
fore let  us  sing  the  song:  Let  all  creation  bless  the  Lord,  and  magnify  him 
unto  all  the  ages. 

Babylon  carried  the  spoil  and  the  spear-won  wealth  of  the  kingdom  of 
Zion  into  captivity.  But  Christ  draweth  unto  Zion  the  treasures  of  the 
same  and  its  Kings,  the  Watchers  of  the  Stars,  guiding  them  by  a  Star. 
Wherefore,  let  us  sing  the  song:  Let  all  creation  bless  the  Lord,  and  mag- 
nify him  unto  all  the  ages. 

Canticle  IX. 

With  the  Ninth  Theme-Song,  instead  of:  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim: 
the  Refrains  of  the  Feast  are  sung: 

Refrain  I.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  Virgin,  the  all-pure  Birth-giver  of 
God,  more  honourable  and  more  glorious  than  the  hosts  on  high. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  A  mystery  strange  and  most  glorious  I  behold: 
The  cavern,  Heaven:  the  Cherubimic  Throne,  a  Virgin;  the  manger,  the 
receptacle  wherein  lieth  Christ  our  God,  whom  nothing  may  contain. 
Him,  therefore,  do  we  magnify,  praising  him  in  song. 

Refrain  2.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  God  born  in  the  flesh  of  a  Virgin. 

Refrain  3.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  King  born  in  a  cavern. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  When  the  Wise  Men  beheld  the  unwonted  course  of 
the  wondrous,  newly  revealed  Star,  exceeding  the  heavenly  bodies  in 
brightness,  they  divined  that  Christ  the  King  was  born  on  earth  in  Beth- 
lehem, for  our  salvation. 

Refrain  4.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  God  who  was  worshipped  by  the  Magi. 

Refrain  5.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  was  announced  unto  the  Wise 
Men  by  a  Star. 

Hymn.  When  the  Wise  Men  said :  Where  is  the  new-born  Infant  King 


i8o  THE  NATIVITY  OF  CHRIST 

whom  the  Star  hath  revealed?  For  we  are  come  to  worship  him.  Then 
the  wrathful  Herod  was  troubled,  and,  raging  against  the  Lord,  that  im- 
pious man  sought  to  slay  Christ. 

Refrain  6.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  pure  Virgin  and  only  Birth-giver  of 
God,  who  gave  birth  unto  Christ  the  King. 

Refrain  7.  The  Wise  Men  and  the  shepherds  came  to  worship  Christ 
who  was  born  in  the  town  of  Bethlehem. 

Hymn.  Herod  inquired  the  time  of  the  Star,  through  whose  guiding 
the  Wise  Men  were  come  to  Bethlehem  to  worship  Christ  with  gifts. 
But  being  by  it  led  again  unto  their  own  country,  they  left  confounded 
behind  them  the  cruel  slayer  of  the  children.

THE  EPIPHANY 

(JANUARY  6 19  N.S.) 

On  the  Eve  of  the  Epiphany  the  same  strict  fast  is  observed,  and  the  same  services  an 
celebrated  as  on  the  Eve  of  Christ's  Nativity  (Christmas).  That  is  to  say:  Th 
Imperial  Hours  are  read,  and  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the  Great  is  celebrated  (i, 
the  Eve  doth  not  fall  upon  Saturday  or  Sunday),  preceded  by  Vespers;  while  in  th 
evening  the  service  consisteth  of  Grand  Compline  joined  to  Matins.  The  differ 
ences  between  these  services  and  those  of  Christmas  lie  in  the  festival  hymns  and  th 
consecration  of  the  water. 

At  this  Feast  there  are  two  Blessings  of  the  Waters:  the  first,  on  the  Eve,  in  Church;  th 
second,  after  the  Divine  Liturgy,  on  the  day  of  the  Feast,  under  the  open  sky,  oj 
rivers,  lakes,  pools  and  wells.  In  ancient  times  the  former  was  intended  for  th 
Catechumens  who  were  prepared  to  receive  baptism,  and  were  then  baptized.  The 
second  was  instituted  later,  in  imitation  of  the  custom  among  the  Christians  oj 
Jerusalem,  who  were  wont  to  go  forth  to  the  Jordan  to  celebrate  the  festival,  and  to 
pray:  also  in  memory  of  the  consecration  of  the  waters  of  the  Jordan  at  the  time  our 
Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  baptized  therein.  This  Blessing  of  the  Waters  is  often 
called  "The  Jordan  Festival"  for  that  reason.

runner, beholding  our  Illuminator  who  illumineth  every  man,  coming  to 
be  baptized,  rejoiceth  in  his  soul;  and  he  trembleth,  and  with  his  hand 
doth  he  point  Him  out  to  the  people,  saying:  Lo,  this  is  he  who  redeemeth 
Israel,  setting  us  free  from  corruption.  O  Christ  our  God,  the  Sinless  One, 
glory  to  thee!     (Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Thou  didst  bow  thy  head  unto  the  Forerunner,  and  thereby  didst  crush 
the  heads  of  the  serpents.  And  having  entered  into  the  stream  thou  didst 
illumine  all  things,  that  they  might  glorify  thee,  O  Saviour,  even  the  Il- 
luminator of  our  souls.

Hymn  being  substituted  for  the  ordinary  ones. 

After:  Glory  be  to  God  on  high :  the  procession  from  the  Sanctuary  for  the  Litiyd 
taketh  place.     (See  the  All-Night  Vigil  Office,  page  11.) 

The  Stanza  for  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  VIII.  To-day  is  creation  illumined, 
to-day  do  all  things  both  heavenly  and  earthly  rejoice.  Angels  and  men 
are  intermingled;  for  whithersoever  the  King  cometh,  there  also  cometh 
orderliness.  Let  us  make  haste  then  unto  Jordan,  and  we  shall  all  behold 
John,  as  he  baptizeth  the  head  not  made  with  hands  and  sinless.  Where- 
fore, singing  the  song  of  the  Apostles,  let  us  cry  with  one  accord :  The 
grace  of  God,  which  is  saving  unto  all  men,  hath  manifested  itself,  illum- 
ining the  faithful  and  bestowing  upon  the  same  great  mercy. 

The  Hymn  (Tropdr)  at  the  Blessing  of  the  Loaves:  The  Hymn  of  the  Feast. 
When  in  Jordan  thou  wast  baptized,  O  Lord,  the  worship  of  the  Trinity 
was  made  manifest.  For  the  voice  of  the  Father  bare  witness  unto  thee, 
calling  thee  his  beloved  Son,  and  the  Spirit,  in  the  form  of  a  Dove,  con- 
firmed the  steadfastness  of  that  word:  O  Christ  our  God,  who  didst  mani- 
fest thyself,  and  dost  enlighten  the  world,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Exaltation  {V elitchdnie) .  We  magnify  thee,  O  life-giving  Christ, 
for  our  sakes  now  baptized  of  John  in  the  waters  of  the  Jordan. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  The  sea  saw  that  and 
fled:  Jordan  was  driven  back. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  What  aileth  thee,  O  thou  sea,  that  thou  fleddest,  and 
Jordan  that  thou  wast  driven  back? 

The  Gospel.  Matt.  i.  9-1 1. 


184  THE  EPIPHANY 

THE   CANON. 
In  Tone  II.     (St.  Cosmas  of  Malum.) 
Canticle  I. 
Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Lord  mighty  in  battle  hath  laid  bare  the 
depths  of  the  sea,  and  hath  led  forth  his  people  on  dry  ground,  after 
having  overwhelmed  therein  their  adversaries :  For  he  hath  glorified  him- 
self. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  The  Lord,  the  King  of  the  ages,  reneweth  corrupt 
Adam  by  the  waters  of  Jordan,  and  crusheth  the  heads  of  the  dragons 
which  lurked  therein:  For  he  hath  glorified  himself. 

The  Lord  having  become  incarnate  of  a  Virgin  and  clothed  the  imma- 
terial fire  of  the  Godhead  in  material  flesh,  is  encompassed  by  the  waters 
of  Jordan:  For  he  hath  glorified  himself. 

The  Lord,  who,  through  his  own  cleansing  in  Jordan,  washeth  away  the 
vileness  of  men,  to  whom  he  was  graciously  pleased  to  conform  himself, 
remaining  still  as  he  was  before,  giveth  light  unto  those  who  are  in  dark- 
ness: For  he  hath  glorified  himself.

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Lord,  who  giveth  strength  unto  our  Kings 
and  exalteth  the  horn  of  his  Anointed,  is  born  of  a  Virgin,  and  cometh  unto 
Baptism.  Unto  him  will  we  faithful  cry  aloud :  There  is  none  holy  like 
unto  our  God. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Rejoice  thou  to-day,  O  Church  of  Christ,  which 
aforetime  wast  sterile  and  barren  of  children ;  for  through  water  and  the 
Spirit  have  sons  been  born  unto  thee,  who  with  faith  do  cry  aloud :  There 
is  none  holy  like  unto  our  God. 

With  a  loud  voice  crieth  the  Forerunner  in  the  wilderness:  Prepare 
ye  the  way  for  Christ,  and  make  straight  the  paths  for  our  God,  crying 
aloud  with  faith:  There  is  none  holy  like  unto  our  God. 

Canticle  IV. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  I  have  heard,  O  Lord,  thy  voice  which  thou  didst 
call  the  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilderness,  which,  when  thou  didst 
thunder  over  many  waters,  bearing  witness  to  thy  Son,  being  filled  with 
the  Spirit  which  had  revealed  itself,  did  cry  aloud :  Thou  art  Christ,  the 
Wisdom  and  the  Power  of  God. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Hath  any  one  —  crieth  the  Messenger  —  beheld 
the  Sun,  which  is  by  nature  radiant,  cleansed?  Shall  I  then  wash  clean 
with  the  waters  thee  who  art  the  Brightness  of  Glory,  the  Express  Image 
of  the  Father  who  is  from  everlasting?  And  shall  I,  who  am  but  grass, 
touch  the  fire  of  thy  divinity?  For  thou  art  Christ,  the  Wisdom  and  the 
Power  of  God. 

Moses,  when  he  drew  near  to  thee,  manifested  the  God-inspired  awe 
wherewith  he  was  seized.   When  he  understood  that  it  was  thou  speaking 


THE  EPIPHANY  185 

from  the  bush,  he  straightway  turned  aside  his  face.  How  then  shall  I 
gaze  openly  upon  thee,  and  how  shall  I  lay  my  hand  upon  thee?  For 
thou  art  Christ,  the  Wisdom,  and  the  Power  of  God. 

In  that  I  have  a  rational  soul,  and  am  honoured  with  the  gift  of  speech, 
I  stand  in  fear  of  things  without  a  soul.  For  if  I  baptize  thee,  the  moun- 
tain which  smoked  with  fire,  the  sea  which  was  parted  in  twain,  and  that 
Jordan  which  rolleth  back  its  waves  shall  be  my  accusers:  For  thou  art 
Christ,  the  Wisdom  and  the  Power  of  God. 

Canticle  V 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Jesus,  the  Chieftain  of  Life,  cometh  to  abolish 
the  condemnation  of  Adam  the  first-created;  and  though,  in  that  he  is 
God,  he  hath  no  need  of  cleansing,  yet  for  the  fallen  is  he  cleansed  in 
Jordan,  where,  having  slain  enmity,  he  bestoweth  the  peace  which  passeth 
understanding. 

Hymns.  When  a  multitude  innumerable  of  people  had  gathered  to- 
gether to  be  baptized  of  John,  he  stood  in  their  midst  and  cried  aloud  unto 
those  who  were  present:  Who  hath  warned  you,  ye  disobedient,  to  flee 
from  the  wrath  to  come?  Bring  ye  worthy  fruits  unto  Christ;  for  now 
revealing  himself  he  bestoweth  peace. 

The  Husbandman  and  Creator,  standing  in  the  midst  as  one  of  the 
throng,  searcheth  hearts;  and  having  taken  in  his  hand  the  winnowing 
fan,  with  exceeding  wisdom  doth  he  purge  the  threshing-floor  of  the  uni- 
verse, burning  up  the  chaff,  but  granting  unto  the  fruitful  grain  life 
eternal. 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme- Song  {Irmos).  The  Voice  of  the  Word,  the  Candlestick  of  the 
Light,  the  Morning  Star,  the  Forerunner  of  the  Sun,  crieth  aloud  in  the 
wilderness  unto  all  men:  Repent  ye,  and  be  ye  cleansed  in  preparation. 
For  lo!  Christ  cometh,  who  redeemeth  the  world  from  corruption. 

Hymns.  Christ,  whose  latchet — when  the  Word  had  taken  our  form  upon 
Him  —  it  is  impossible  to  unloose,  as  the  Forerunner  teacheth,  in  that  he 
was  born  without  corruption  of  God  the  Father,  is  without  defilement 
made  flesh  of  a  Virgin :  For  he  redeemeth  the  earth-born  from  their  guile. 

With  extirpating  fire  doth  Christ  baptize  the  froward  and  those  who 
acknowledge  him  not  as  God.  But  with  the  Spirit,  by  means  of  water, 
doth  he  graciously  renew  those  who  confess  his  divinity,  freeing  them  from 
their  sins. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  A  rushing  mighty  wind  bearing  dew,  and  the 
descent  of  the  Angel  of  God  preserved  unscathed  the  Children  who  held 
converse  together  in  the  fiery  furnace.  When,  therefore,  they  were  be- 
dewed amid  the  flames,  with  gratitude  did  they  sing  aloud:  Blessed  be 
thou,  O  exceeding  glorious  God  of  our  fathers  and  our  God ! 

Hymns.  With  trembling  and  amazement,  as  over  heaven  itself,  did  the 


186  THE  EPIPHANY 

Angelic  Host  stand  over  Jordan,  gazing  down  upon  such  condescension 
of  God ;  beholding  how  he  who  ruleth  the  firmament  of  the  waters  on 
high,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  bearing  bodily  form,  stood  in  the  water. 

The  marvel  of  the  baptism  divine  was  foreshadowed  of  old  by  the 
cloud  and  the  sea,  wherein  as  they  journeyed  onward  the  ancient  people 
were  baptized  into  the  Giver  of  the  Law.  The  sea  was  the  symbol  of  the 
water,  and  the  cloud  of  the  Spirit;  being  made  perfect  in  which,  let  us  cry: 
Blessed  be  thou,  O  Lord  God  forever! 

Let  all  us  faithful,  speaking  devoutly  of  Him  from  whom  we  have  re- 
ceived sanctification,  in  company  with  the  Angels  perpetually  glorify  the 
Father,  Son  and  Holy  Spirit:  for  He  is  a  Trinity  in  Persons,  but  one  in 
Essence,  one  God;  to  whom,  also,  let  us  sing:  Blessed  be  thou,  O  Lord  God 
forever ! 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Babylonian  furnace,  dew-dropping,  fore- 
shadowed the  image  of  the  wondrous  mystery  that  Jordan  was  to  receive 
into  its  waters  the  Fire  Immaterial,  and  contain  the  Creator  when  he 
should  be  baptized  in  the  flesh :  whom  also  all  men  do  bless  and  exalt  unto 
all  the  ages. 

Hymns.  Put  away  all  fear,  said  the  Redeemer  to  the  Forerunner ;  obey 
me,  come  unto  me,  as  unto  the  Gracious  One,  for  that  am  I  in  my  Essence. 
Submit  thyself  to  my  command,  and  baptize  me,  who  have  come  down 
hither;  whom  also  all  men  do  bless  and  exalt  unto  all  the  ages. 

The  Baptist,  when  he  heard  the  words  of  the  Lord,  stretched  forth  his 
hand  with  trembling;  but  when  he  had  touched  the  crown  of  his  Creator's 
head,  he  cried  unto  him  who  was  receiving  baptism:  Sanctify  thou  me, 
for  thou  art  my  God;  whom  also  all  men  do  bless  and  exalt  unto  all  the 
ages. 

In  Jordan  was  the  Trinity  made  manifest;  for  the  Most  Divine  Person 
of  the  Father  Himself  proclaimed:  He  that  is  baptized,  the  same  is  my 
beloved  Son.  And  the  Spirit  descended  upon  him  that  was  like  unto 
Himself.     Him  do  men  bless  and  exalt  unto  all  the  ages. 

Canticle  IX. 

Before  the  Ninth  Theme-Song:  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim:  is  not  sung, 
but  instead  thereof  the  Refrain  of  the  Feast: 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  her  who  is  more  honourable  than  the  hosts  on 
high,  even  the  most  pure  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  No  tongue  hath  power  worthily  to  praise  thee, 
and  even  the  supra-mundane  mind  is  perplexed  how  to  hymn  thee,  O 
Birth-giver  of  God.  But  inasmuch  as  thou  art  gracious,  accept  thou  our 
faith ;  for  our  God-inspired  love  thou  knowest.  For  thou  art  the  Inter- 
cessor of  Christians.     We  magnify  thee. 


THE  EPIPHANY  187 

And  the  remaining  six  Refrains  are  sung  once  with  each  Hymn. 

Refrain  2.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  asketh  baptism  of  the  Fore- 
runner. 

Refrain  3.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  is  come  unto  the  Jordan  to  be 
baptized. 

Hymn.  Come  thou  in  spirit,  O  David,  unto  those  who  are  being  illu- 
mined by  the  Spirit,  and  sing,  saying:  Draw  near  now  unto  God  and  be 
ye  illumined  by  faith.  That  poor  man,  Adam,  cried  in  his  fall,  and  the 
Lord  heard  him  as  he  came,  and  in  the  waters  of  Jordan  did  he  renew 
that  corrupted  one. 

Refrain  4.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  to  whom  the  voice  of  the  Father 
bare  witness. 

Refrain  5.  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  One  of  the  Trinity  who  hath  bowed 
his  neck  and  accepted  baptism. 

Hymn.  Wash  you,  make  you  clean,  saith  Isaiah;  put  away  the  evil  of 
your  doings  before  the  Lord.  Ye  who  thirst,  come  ye  unto  the  Living 
Water;  for  Christ  sprinkleth  with  water  which  giveth  new  life  those  who 
make  supplication  unto  him  in  faith,  and  baptizeth  them  with  the  Spirit 
unto  the  life  which  waxeth  not  old. 

Refrain  6.  O  Prophet,  come  thou  unto  me;  stretch  forth  thy  hand,  and 
baptize  me  quickly. 

Refrain  7.  O  Prophet,  lay  aside  now  all  other  things,  and  baptize  me 
who  desire  it ;  for  I  am  come  to  fulfil  all  righteousness. 

Hymn.  May  the  grace  and  seal  (of  the  Spirit)  preserve  us,  O  faithful! 
For  as  the  Hebrews  of  old  were  delivered  from  destruction  when  their 
door-posts  were  smeared  with  blood,  even  so  also  shall  this  divine  bath  of 
regeneration  be  made  a  deliverance  for  us,  and  even  so  also  shall  we  be- 
hold the  light  of  the  Trinity  which  knoweth  no  setting.

Son,  and  the  Spirit,  in  the  form  of  a  dove,  confirmed  the  steadfastness  of 
that  word.  O  Christ  our  God,  who  didst  manifest  thyself,  and  dost  en-

THE  OFFICE   AT   THE  GREAT  BLESSING  OF  WATERS  AT 

THE  HOLY  EPIPHANY 

At  the  end  of  the  Divine  Liturgy,  after  the  Prayer  before  the  Tribune:  O  Lord,  who 
blessest  those  who  bless  thee :  hath  been  said  by  the  Priest,  we  all  go  forth  to  the 
Baptismal  Font,  preceded  by  the  taper-bearers,  after  whom  go  the  Deacon  and  the 
Priest  bearing  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  and  the  censer,  and  the  Brethren,  singing 
the  following  Hymn,  in  Tone  VIII.: 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  crieth  out  over  the  waters,  saying:  Come,  receive 
ye  all  the  spirit  of  wisdom,  the  spirit  of  understanding,  the  spirit  of  the 
fear  of  God,  even  Christ  who  is  made  manifest.     (Thrice.) 

To-day  is  the  nature  of  water  sanctified,  and  Jordan  is  cloven  asunder, 
and  rolleth  back  the  current  of  its  flood,  as  it  beholdeth  the  Lord  baptized. 
(Twice.) 

As  a  man  didst  thou  come  unto  that  river,  O  Christ  our  King,  and  didst 
earnestly  desire  to  receive  the  baptism  of  a  servant,  O  Good  One,  at  the 
hands  of  the  Forerunner,  because  of  our  sins,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 
(Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

In  the  same  Tone: 
Unto  the  voice  of  him  crying  in  the  wilderness:  Prepare  ye  the  way  of 
the  Lord:  thou  didst  come  forth,  O  Lord,  having  taken  on  the  form  of  a 
servant,  and  asking  baptism,  though  thou  knewest  not  sin.  The  waters 
beheld  thee  and  were  affrighted.  The  Baptist  became  all  trembling,  and 
cried  aloud,  saying:  How  shall  the  candlestick  illumine  the  light?  How 
shall  a  slave  lay  hands  upon  his  Lord?  Sanctify  thou  me  and  these 
waters,  O  Saviour,  who  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  world. 

And  taking  his  stand  beside  the  Font,  the  Deacon  immediately  saith: 

Wisdom ! 

The  Reader.  The  Parable  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Thus  saith  the  Lord  (ch.  xxxv.) :  The  wilderness  and  the  solitary  place 
shall  be  glad  for  them;  and  the  desert  shall  rejoice,  and  blossom  as  the 
rose.  It  shall  blossom  abundantly,  and  rejoice,  even  with  joy  and  sing- 
ing: the  glory  of  Lebanon  shall  be  given  unto  it,  the  excellency  of  Carmel 
and  Sharon,  they  shall  see  the  glory  of  the  Lord,  and  the  excellency  of  our 
God.  Strengthen  ye  the  weak  hands,  and  confirm  the  feeble  knees.  Say 
to  them  that  are  of  a  fearful  heart,  Be  strong,  fear  not:  behold,  your  God 


190  THE  EPIPHANY 

will  come  with  vengeance,  even  God  with  a  recompense;  he  will  come  and 
save  you.  Then  the  eyes  of  the  blind  shall  be  opened,  and  the  ears  of  the 
deaf  shall  be  unstopped.  Then  shall  the  lame  man  leap  as  an  hart,  and 
the  tongue  of  the  dumb  sing:  for  in  the  wilderness  shall  waters  break  out, 
and  streams  in  the  desert.  And  the  parched  ground  shall  become  a  pool, 
and  the  thirsty  land  springs  of  water:  in  the  habitation  of  dragons,  where 
each  lay,  shall  be  grass  with  reeds  and  rushes.  And  an  highway  shall  be 
there,  and  a  way,  and  it  shall  be  called,  The  way  of  holiness,  the  unclean 
shall  not  pass  over  it;  but  it  shall  be  for  those:  the  wayfaring  men,  though 
fools,  shall  not  err  therein.  No  lion  shall  be  there,  nor  any  ravenous 
beast  shall  go  up  thereon,  it  shall  not  be  found  there;  but  the  redeemed 
shall  walk  there :  and  the  ransomed  of  the  Lord  shall  return,  and  come  to 
Zion  with  songs  and  everlasting  joy  upon  their  heads:  they  shall  obtain 
joy  and  gladness,  and  sorrow  and  sighing  shall  flee  away. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  The  Parable  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Thus  saith  the  Lord  (ch.  h.) :  Ho,  every  one  that  thirsteth,  come  ye  to 
the  waters,  and  he  that  hath  no  money;  come  ye,  buy,  and  eat;  yea,  come, 
buy  wine  and  milk  without  money  and  without  price.     Wherefore  do  ye 
spend  money  for  that  which  is  not  bread?  and  your  labour  for  that  which 
satisfieth  not?  hearken  diligently  unto  me,  and  eat  ye  that  which  is  good, 
and  let  your  soul  delight  itself  in  fatness.     Incline  your  ear,  and  come  unto 
me:  hear,  and  your  soul  shall  live;  and  I  will  make  an  everlasting  cove- 
nant with  you,  even  the  sure  mercies  of  David.    Behold,  I  have  given  him 
for  a  witness  to  the  people,  a  leader  and  commander  to  the  people.     Be- 
hold, thou  shalt  call  a  nation  that  thou  knowest  not,  and  nations  that 
knew  not  these  shall  run  unto  thee,  because  of  the  Lord  thy  God,  and  for 
the  Holy  One  of  Israel;  for  he  hath  glorified  thee.     Seek  ye  the  Lord 
while  he  may  be  found,  call  ye  upon  him  while  he  is  near:  let  the  wicked 
forsake  his  way,  and  the  unrighteous  man  his  thoughts:  and  let  him  re- 
turn unto  the  Lord,  and  he  will  have  mercy  upon  him;  and  to  our  God, 
for  he  will  abundantly  pardon.     For  my  thoughts  are  not  your  thoughts, 
neither  are  your  ways  my  ways,  saith  the  Lord.     For  as  the  heavens  are 
higher  than  the  earth,  so  are  my  ways  higher  than  your  ways,  and  my 
thoughts  than  your  thoughts.     For  as  the  rain  cometh  down,  and  the 
snow  from  heaven,  and  returneth  not  thither,  butwatereth  the  earth,  and 
maketh  it  bring  forth  and  bud,  that  it  may  give  seed  to  the  sower,  and 
bread  to  the  eater:  so  shall  my  word  be  that  goeth  forth  out  of  my  mouth : 
it  shall  not  return  unto  me  void,  but  it  shall  accomplish  that  which  I 
please,  and  it  shall  prosper  in  the  thing  whereto  I  sent  it.     For  ye  shall 
go  out  with  joy,  and  be  led  forth  with  peace:  the  mountains  and  the  hills 
shall  break  forth  before  you  into  singing,  and  all  the  trees  of  the  field 
shall  clap  their  hands.     Instead  of  the  thorn  shall  come  up  the  fir-tree, 


THE  GREAT  BLESSING  OF  WATERS  191 

and  instead  of  the  brier  shall  come  up  the  myrtle- tree :  and  it  shall  be  to 
the  Lord  for  a  name,  for  an  everlasting  sign  that  shall  not  be  cut  off.

the  Lord,  call  upon  his  name,  declare  his  doings  among  the  people,  make 
mention  that  his  name  is  exalted.  Sing  unto  the  Lord;  for  he  hath  done 
excellent  things:  this  is  known  in  all  the  earth.  Cry  out  and  shout,  thou 
inhabitant  of  Zion:  for  great  is  the  Holy  One  of  Israel  in  the  midst  of  thee.

Brethren  (/  Cor.  x.  1-4) :  I  would  not  that  ye  should  be  ignorant  how 
that  all  our  fathers  were  under  the  cloud,  and  all  passed  through  the  sea; 
and  were  all  baptized  unto  Moses  in  the  cloud  and  in  the  sea;  and  did  all 
eat  the  same  spiritual  meat;  and  did  all  drink  the  same  spiritual  drink 
(for  they  drank  of  that  spiritual  Rock  that  followed  them ;  and  that  Rock 
was  Christ).

(Ch.  i.  g-11.)  Priest.  And  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days,  that  Jesus 
came  from  Nazareth  of  Galilee,  and  was  baptized  of  John  in  Jordan. 
And  straightway  coming  up  out  of  the  water,  he  saw  the  heavens  opened, 
and  the  Spirit  like  a  dove  descending  upon  him      And  there  came  a  voice

frail  and  lowly  sub- 
stance, and  hast  con- 
descended to  the  stat- 
ure of  a  servant;  who

baptism  in  Jordan  at

worthy servants,  ac- 
cording to  thy  divine

194  THE  EPIPHANY 

glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  when  the  Deacon  hath  finished  the  Litany,  the  Priest  reciteth,  aloud,  the  following 
Prayer: 

Great  art  thou,  O  Lord,  and  marvellous  are  thy  works,  and  speech 
sufficeth  not  to  sing  the  praises  of  thy  wonders.     (Thrice.) 

For  thou,  by  thy  will,  from  nothingness  hast  brought  all  things  into 
being;  by  thy  majesty  thou  dost  uphold  all  creation,  and  by  thy  provi- 
dence thou  dost  direct  the  world.  When  thou  hadst  framed  the  universe 
out  of  four  elements,  thou  didst  crown  the  circle  of  the  year  with  four 
seasons.  All  the  reason-endowed  powers  tremble  before  thee.  The  Sun 
singeth  thy  praises,  and  the  Moon  glorifieth  thee;  the  Stars,  also,  stand 
before  thy  presence.  The  Light  obeyeth  thee.  The  deeps  shudder  with 
awe  before  thee;  the  water-springs  do  thy  bidding.  Thou  hast  spread 
out  the  heavens  like  a  curtain.  Thou  hast  established  the  earth  upon  the 
waters.  With  sand  hast  thou  walled  in  the  sea.  Thou  hast  shed  abroad 
the  air  for  breathing.  The  Angelic  Powers  serve  thee.  The  Archangelic 
hosts  adore  thee.  The  many-eyed  Cherubim  and  the  six-winged  Sera- 
phim, as  they  stand  round  about  and  do  fly,  veil  their  faces  with  awe  be- 
fore thine  unapproachable  glory  For  thou,  the  God  which  cannot  be 
circumscribed,  who  art  from  everlasting  and  ineffable,  didst  come  down 
upon  earth,  taking  on  the  form  of  a  servant,  and  being  made  in  the  like- 
ness of  men.  For  thou  couldst  not  endure,  O  Master,  because  of  thy 
tender-hearted  mercy,  to  behold  the  children  of  men  tormented  by  the 
devil ;  but  thou  didst  come,  and  didst  save  us.  We  confess  thy  grace;  we 
proclaim  thy  mercy;  we  conceal  not  thy  gracious  deeds.  Thou  hast  set 
at  liberty  the  generations  of  our  race;  by  thy  birth  thou  hast  sanctified 
a  Virgin's  womb.  All  creation  singeth  praises  unto  thee,  who  didst  re- 
veal thyself;  for  thou,  our  God,  didst  manifest  thyself  upon  earth,  and 
didst  dwell  among  men.  Thou  didst  hallow,  also,  the  streams  of  Jordan, 
in  that  thou  didst  send  down  from  heaven  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  didst 
crush  the  heads  of  the  serpents  which  lurked  there. 

Then  the  Priest  repeateth,  thrice,  the  following,  and  blesseth  the  water  with  his  hand 
at  each  repetition. 

Wherefore  do  thou,  O  King  who  lovest  mankind,  come  down  now  also 
through  the  descent  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  sanctify  this  water.     (Thrice.) 

And  impart  unto  it  the  grace  of  redemption,  the  blessing  of  Jordan. 
Make  it  a  fountain  of  immortality,  a  gift  of  sanctification,  a  remission  of 
sins,  a  healing  of  infirmities,  a  destruction  of  demons;  unapproachable  by 
hostile  powers,  filled  with  angelic  might.  And  may  it  be  unto  all  those 
who  shall  draw  it,  and  shall  partake  of  it  unto  the  purification  of  their 
souls  and  bodies,  unto  the  healing  of  their  passions,  unto  the  sanctifica- 


THE  GREAT  BLESSING  OF  WATERS  195 

tion  of  their  houses,  and  unto  every  expedient  service.  For  thou  art  our 
God,  who  through  water  and  the  Spirit  dost  renew  our  nature,  which  had 
fallen  into  decay  through  sin.  For  thou  art  our  God,  who  with  water 
didst  drown  sin  in  the  days  of  Noah.  For  thou  art  our  God,  who  by  the 
sea,  through  Moses,  didst  set  free  from  slavery  to  Pharaoh  the  Hebrew 
race.  For  thou  art  our  God,  who  didst  cleave  the  rock  in  the  wilderness, 
so  that  water  gushed  forth,  and  who  madest  the  floods  to  well  forth  abun- 
dantly; and  didst  satisfy  thy  thirsty  people.  For  thou  art  our  God,  who 
by  fire  and  water,  through  Elijah,  didst  set  Israel  free  from  the  errors  of 
Baal. 

Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  sanctify  now  also  this  water  by  thy  Holy 
Spirit.     (Thrice.) 

Grant  also  unto  all  who  shall  be  sprinkled  therewith,  and  shall  partake 
thereof,  and  shall  anoint  themselves  therewith,  sanctification,  blessing, 
purification  and  bodily  health. 

And  save,  O  Lord,  thy  servant,  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  and 
all  the  Authorities. 

Save,  O  Lord,  and  show  mercy  upon  the  Most  Holy  Synod,  and  keep 
them  in  peace  beneath  thy  shelter.  Subdue  under  them  every  foe  and 
adversary;  grant  all  their  petitions  which  are  unto  salvation  and  life  eter- 
nal; that  with  the  elements,  and  men,  and  Angels,  and  with  all  things 
visible  and  invisible,  they  may  magnify  thy  most  holy  Name,  together 
with  the  Father,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Priest,  bowing  his  head,  prayeth: 
Incline  thine  ear,  O  Lord,  and  hear  us,  O  thou  who  wast  graciously 
pleased  to  receive  baptism  in  Jordan,  and  didst  sanctify  the  waters. 
Bless  all  us  who,  by  the  bowing  of  our  necks,  do  outwardly  signify  our 
humility  of  mind:  and  graciously  grant  that  we  may  be  filled  with  thy 
sanctification,  through  our  partaking  of  this  water,  and  through  sprin- 
kling therewith.  And  may  be  it  unto  us,  O  Lord,  for  the  health  of  our 
souls  and  bodies. 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  For  thou  art  the  sanctification  of  our  souls  and  bodies,  and  unto 
thee  we  ascribe  glory,  and  thanksgiving  and  worship,  together  with  thy 
Father,  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life- 
giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  again  blessing  the  water  in  cross-form  with  the  holy  cross,  he  dippeth  it  therein, 
upright,  elevating  and  lowering  it,  holding  it  with  both  hands,  and  singing  the 
following  Hymn  in  Tone  I.: 

When  in  Jordan  thou  wast  baptized,  O  Lord,  the  worship  of  the  Trin- 


196  THE  EPIPHANY 

ity  was  made  manifest.  For  the  voice  of  the  Father  bare  witness  unto 
thee,  calling  thee  his  beloved  Son,  and  the  Spirit,  in  the  form  of  a  dove, 
confirmed  the  steadfastness  of  that  word.  O  Christ,  who  didst  manifest 
thyself,  and  dost  enlighten  the  world,  glory  to  thee. 

And  the  Choir  singeth  the  same. 

Then  he  blesseth  the  waters  a  second  time,  in  like  manner.    And  the  Singers  repeat. 

And  likewise,  a  third  time. 

Then  the  Priest  taketh  of  the  holy  water  in  a  vessel,  and  turneth  his  face  toward  the 
People,  holding  the  cross  in  his  left  hand,  and  in  his  right  the  aspergillus.  And  the 
People  approach,  and  kiss  the  precious  cross;  and  the  Priest  blesseth  them,  and 
signeth  them,  on  the  face,  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  with  the  holy  tvater  on  the 
aspergillus. 

Then  they  enter  the  Church  again,  singing,  in  Tone  VI.: 
Let  us  praise  in  song,  ye  faithful,  the  greatness  of  God's  favour  to  us- 
ward.  For,  having  become  man  because  of  our  transgressions,  by  our 
purification  is  he  purified  in  Jordan,  he,  the  only  pure  and  spotless  One, 
who  sanctifieth  me  and  the  waters,  and  crusheth  the  heads  of  the  serpents 
in  the  water.  Wherefore,  O  brethren,  let  us  draw  of  that  water  with  joy; 
for  the  grace  of  the  Spirit  is  invisibly  imparted  unto  him  who,  with  faith, 
doth  draw  thereof,  by  Christ  our  God,  who  also  is  the  Saviour  of  our  souls. 
Choir.  Blessed  be  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  henceforth,  and  forever. 
{Thrice.) 

Psalm  xxxiv. 

I  will  alway  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord :  his  praise  shall  ever  be  in  my 
mouth.  My  soul  shall  make  her  boast  in  the  Lord ;  the  humble  shall  hear 
thereof,  and  be  glad.  O  praise  the  Lord  with  me,  and  let  us  magnify  his 
Name  together.  I  sought  the  Lord,  and  he  heard  me;  yea,  he  delivered 
me  out  of  all  my  fear.  They  had  an  eye  unto  him,  and  were  lightened; 
and  their  faces  were  not  ashamed.  Lo,  the  poor  crieth,  and  the  Lord 
heareth  him ;  yea,  and  saveth  him  out  of  all  his  troubles.  The  angel  of  the 
Lord  tarrieth  round  about  them  that  fear  him,  and  delivereth  them.  O 
taste,  and  see,  how  gracious  the  Lord  is:  blessed  is  the  man  that  trusteth 
in  him.  O  fear  the  Lord,  ye  that  are  his  saints;  for  they  that  fear  him 
lack  nothing.  The  lions  do  lack,  and  suffer  hunger;  but  they  who  seek 
the  Lord  shall  want  no  manner  of  thing  that  is  good.  Come,  ye  children, 
and  hearken  unto  me;  I  will  teach  you  the  fear  of  the  Lord.  What  man 
is  he  that  lusteth  to  live,  and  would  fain  see  good  days?  Keep  thy  tongue 
from  evil,  and  thy  lips,  that  they  speak  no  guile.  Eschew  evil,  and  do 
good ;  seek  peace,  and  ensue  it.  The  eyes  of  the  Lord  are  over  the  right- 
eous, and  his  ears  are  open  unto  their  prayers.  The  countenance  of  the 
Lord  is  against  them  that  do  evil;  to  root  out  the  remembrance  of  them 
from  the  earth.  The  righteous  cry,  and  the  Lord  heareth  them,  and  de- 
livereth them  out  of  all  their  troubles.     The  Lord  is  nigh  unto  them  that 


THE  GREAT  BLESSING  OF  WATERS  197 

are  of  a  contrite  heart,  and  will  save  such  as  be  of  an  humble  spirit. 
Great  are  the  troubles  of  the  righteous;  but  the  Lord  delivereth  him  out 
of  all.  He  keepeth  all  his  bones,  so  that  not  one  of  them  is  broken.  But 
misfortune  shall  slay  the  ungodly;  and  they  that  hate  the  righteous  shall 
be  desolate.  The  Lord  delivereth  the  souls  of  his  servants ;  and  all  they 
that  put  their  trust  in  him  shall  not  be  destitute. 

And  having  first  drunk  of  the  holy  water,  the  People  take  the  Antidoron,  that  is,  the 
blessed  bread,  from  the  Priest. 

Then  the  Benediction  is  pronounced: 
May  he  who  was  graciously  pleased  to  accept  baptism  from  John,  in 
Jordan,  for  the  sake  of  our  salvation,  Christ  our  true  God,  through  the 
prayers  of  his  most  pure  Mother,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon 
us  and  save  us;  forasmuch  as  he  is  gracious  and  loveth  mankind. 


THE  MEETING  OF  THE  LORD 
THE  PURIFICATION  OF  THE  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER  OF  GOD 

(FEBRUARY  2 — 15  N.S.) 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried :  In  Tone  I.  Let  us  also 
come :  with  hymns  divine  let  us  meet  Christ  and  receive  him  whose  salva- 
tion Simeon  beheld.  For  this  is  he  of  whom  David  prophesied:  This  is  he 
who  spake  by  the  prophets;  who  for  our  sakes  became  incarnate,  and  pro- 
claimed the  law.     Him  let  us  worship.     {Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Tone  VI.  To-day  let  the  door  of  heaven  be  opened:  for  the  Father's 
Word,  which  is  from  everlasting,  having  taken  his  beginning  in  time  from 
a  Virgin,  without  renouncing  his  Godhead,  is  of  her  own  free  will  brought 
by  his  mother,  as  a  babe  of  forty  days,  into  the  temple  under  the  law :  and 
an  aged  man  receive th  him  in  his  arms,  crying:  Let  thy  servant  depart, 
O  Lord;  for  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation,  which  is  come  into  the 
world  to  save  the  race  of  men.     Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord. 

The  Parables  (Paremii).  Exodus  xii.  51,  xiii.  1-3,  11-12,  14-16;  Lev. 
xii.  2-4,  6,  8;  Isaiah  vi.  1-13,  xix.  1,  3-5,  12,  19-21. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  I.  (by  Anatolius).  The  Ancient  of 
Days,  who  of  old  gave  the  Law  unto  Moses,  on  Sinai,  to-day  is  seen  as  a 
little  Child;  and  in  accordance  with  the  Law,  as  the  creator  of  the  Law, 
fulfilling  the  Law,  is  brought  into  the  temple,  and  given  to  an  aged  man. 
And  Simeon  the  Righteous,  having  received  him,  and  perceived  the  ful- 
filment of  the  promises  accomplished,  cried  aloud  with  joy:  Mine  eyes 
have  seen  the  mystery  hidden  from  eternity  in  these  latter  days  revealed, 
the  light  which  destroyeth  the  darkness  of  unbelieving  heathen,  and 
giveth  glory  unto  newly  chosen  Israel.  Wherefore,  release  thou  thy 
servant  from  the  bonds  of  this  flesh  unto  the  life  which  waxeth  not  old, 
marvellous  and  unending;  granting  unto' the  world  great  mercy. 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  I.  Hail,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver 
of  God :  for  from  thee  hath  shone  forth  the  Sun  of  Righteousness,  Christ 
our  God,  who  giveth  light  to  those  who  are  in  darkness.  And  rejoice, 
thou  aged,  righteous  man,  that  didst  receive  in  thine  arms  the  Redeemer 
of  our  souls,  who  giveth  unto  us  resurrection. 

The  Exaltation  (Velitchdnie) .  We  magnify  thee,  O  life-giving  Christ, 
and  we  do  homage  to  thy  Mother  most  pure,  by  whom  thou  hast  now 
been  brought  into  the  Temple  of  the  Lord,  according  to  the  Law. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  I  will  call  to  remembrance 
thy  Name  from  generation  to  generation. 


THE  MEETING  OF  THE  LORD  199 

Verse  (Stikh) :  My  heart  is  inditing  of  a  good  matter. 

The  Gospel.  Luke  ii.  25-32. 

The  Benediction.  May  he  who,  for  the  sake  of  our  salvation,  deigned  to 
be  held  in  the  arms  of  the  righteous  Simeon,  Christ  our  true  God:  and  the 
rest.     (See  page  122.) 

THE   CANON. 
The  First  Canon.     Tone  III.     (St.  Cosmas  of  Maium.) 

Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  The  sun  once,  of  old,  rose  over  the  dry  land 
born  of  the  deep :  for  the  water  was  hardened  into  walls  upon  either  side, 
and  the  people  passed  on  foot  over  the  sea,  and  sang,  in  manner  well- 
pleasing  unto  God:  Let  us  sing  unto  the  Lord,  for  gloriously  hath  he  been 
glorified. 

III.  O  Lord,  the  Confirmation  of  those  who  set  their  hope  on  thee,  con- 
firm thou  thy  Church,  which  thou  hast  bought  with  thy  precious  blood. 

IV  Thine  excellence,  O  Christ,  hath  covered  the  heavens;  for  when 
thou  hadst  come  forth  from  the  ark  of  thy  Holy  Place,  even  thy  Mother 
undefiled,  thou  didst  appear  in  the  temple  of  thy  glory  as  a  little  Child 
borne  in  arms :  and  all  things  were  filled  with  thy  praise. 

V.  When  Isaiah  symbolically  beheld  God  borne  on  high  upon  the 
throne,  attended  by  a  body-guard  of  Angels  of  glory,  he  exclaimed:  O 
miserable  man  that  I  am,  I  have  foreseen  God  Incarnate,  who  hath  do- 
minion over  the  Light  which  knoweth  no  setting,  and  the  Peace  which 
reigneth  forever. 

VI.  The  Aged  Man,  when  with  his  eyes  he  beheld  the  salvation  which 
was  come  from  God  unto  the  nations,  cried  aloud  unto  thee:  Thou  art  my 
God,  O  Christ! 

VII.  Thee,  O  God  the  Word,  who  didst  shed  dew  upon  the  Children 
which  sang  praises  unto  God  in  the  fire,  and  who  didst  take  up  thine 
abode  in  a  Virgin  undefiled,  do  we  hymn,  devoutly  singing:  Blessed  is  the 
God  of  our  fathers! 

VIII.  The  Youths  supreme  in  godliness,  when  they  were  thrust  into 
the  fire  insupportable  yet  suffered  no  hurt  from  the  flame,  sang  aloud  the 
song  divine:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye  the  Lord,  and  magnify 
him  unto  all  the  ages! 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord :  the  Refrains: 

O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  the  Hope  of  Christians,  protect,  guard 
and  save  thou  those  who  put  their  trust  in  thee. 

O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  gracious  Helper  of  the  world,  protect  and 
keep  us  from  all  need  and  distress. 

O  God-bearing  Simeon,  come  and  take  in  thine  arms  Christ,  to  whom 
Mary  the  Virgin  Pure  hath  given  birth. 

Simeon  the  aged  encompasseth  in  his  embrace  the  Creator  of  the  Law, 
and  the  Lord  of  all. 


200  THE  MEETING  OF  THE  LORD 

The  Aged  Man  holdeth  not  Me,  but  I  hold  him:  for  he  entreateth  of 
Me  that  he  may  depart  in  peace. 

Ye  Pincers  mystical,  how  shall  ye  bear  the  coal  of  fire?  How  shall  ye 
nourish  the  Nourisher  of  all? 

0  Daughter  of  Phanuel,  come  and  abide  with  us,  and  bless  Christ  the 
Saviour,  the  Son  of  God. 

Anna  the  Chaste  foretelleth  terrible  things,  confessing  Christ  to  be  the 
Maker  of  heaven  and  earth. 

Incomprehensible  unto  Angels  and  unto  men  is  that  which  is  wrought 
with  thee,  O  Virgin  Mother  Pure. 

A  pure  dove,  a  spotless  lamb  bringeth  into  the  Church  the  Lamb  and 
the  Shepherd. 

O  Christ,  King  of  all !  Grant  me  burning  tears,  and  I  will  weep  for  my 
soul  which  is  all  ruined. 

IX.  In  the  Law  — ■  in  the  shadow  and  in  the  Scriptures  —  do  we,  the 
faithful,  behold  the  symbol.  Every  male  child  which  first  opened  the 
womb  was  consecrated  to  God:  wherefore,  also,  the  first-born  Word  of 
the  Father,  who  is  from  everlasting,  the  first-born  Son  of  his  Mother 
who  knew  not  man,  do  we  magnify.      ' 

At  the  Liturgy. 

The  Introit.  The  Lord  hath  declared  his  salvation,  he  hath  revealed  his 
righteousness  in  the  presence  of  the  nations. 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  Thou  who  by  thy  birth  didst  sanctify  the 
Virgin's  womb,  and  didst  bless  the  arms  of  Simeon,  as  it  was  meet,  having 
preserved  us  in  anticipation  from  condemnation,  hast  now  also  saved  us, 
O  Christ-God.  But  grant  tranquillity  amid  the  alarms  of  war  unto  our 
Ruler,  and  keep  him,  whom  thou  hast  adopted  into  thy  love,  O  thou  who 
alone  lovest  mankind. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  My  soul  doth  magnify 
the  Lord,  and  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in  God  my  Saviour. 

Verse:  For  he  hath  regarded  the  lowliness  of  his  handmaiden:  for  be- 
hold, from  henceforth,  all  generations  shall  call  me  blessed. 

The  Epistle.  Heb.  vii.  7-17. 

Alleluia.  {Tone  VIII.)  Lord,  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in 
peace,  according  to  thy  word. 

Verse:  A  light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  the  glory  of  thy  people 
Israel.

The  Communion  Hymn.  I  will  take  the  cup  of  salvation,  and  call  upon 
the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

The  Benediction.  (See  page  199.) 


THE  ANNUNCIATION  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  VIRGIN 

(MARCH  25  —  APRIL  7  N.S.) 

This  Feast  almost  always  falleth  in  the  Great  Fast  (Lent) . 

If  the  Feast  of  the  A  nnunciaiion  fall  upon  any  day  upon  the  eve  whereof  Vespers 

hath  been  celebrated  alone,  or  in  conjunction  with  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanciified 

Gifts,  then  the  Vigil  Service  beginneth  with  Great  Compline. 
If  it  fall  upon  Sunday  or  Monday,  the  Vigil  Service  beginneth  with  Great  Vespers. 

But  if  it  fall  upon  Great  (Good)  Friday,  or  Great  (Holy)  Saturday,  the  Vigil 

Service  beginneth  directly  with  Matins. 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  VI.  Gabriel, 
when  he  revealed  unto  thee,  O  Maiden,  the  counsel  of  God  which  was 
from  everlasting,  did  stand  before  thee,  saluting  thee,  and  proclaiming: 
Hail,  O  Earth  Unsown!  Hail,  O  Bush  which  Burned,  yet  was  not  con- 
sumed! Hail,  O  Abyss  Unfathomable!  Hail,  O  Bridge  which  leadeth 
unto  heaven,  and  Ladder  lofty,  which  Jacob  saw!  Hail,  O  Pot  Divine  of 
Manna!  Hail,  O  Abrogation  of  the  curse!  Hail,  O  Recall  of  Adam! 
The  Lord  is  with  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Gabriel  the  Archangel  was  sent  from  heaven  to  announce  the  glad 
tidings  of  conception  unto  a  Virgin;  and  when  he  was  come  to  Nazareth, 
he  mused  within  himself,  being  astonished  at  the  marvel:  O,  how  can  he 
who  on  high  is  beyond  comprehension  be  born  of  a  Virgin !  He  who  hath 
heaven  for  his  throne,  and  earth  for  his  footstool,  taketh  up  his  abode  in 
the  womb  of  a  Virgin!  He  upon  whom  the  Six-winged  and  the  Many- 
eyed  are  unable  to  gaze  deigneth,  by  his  word  alone,  to  become  incarnate 
of  her,  and  he  is  the  true  Word  of  God.  Wherefore  then  stand  I  thus, 
and  say  not  unto  the  Virign:  Hail,  O  pure  Virgin!  Hail,  O  Bride  un- 
wedded,  the  Lord  is  with  thee !  Hail,  O  Mother  of  the  Life,  blessed  is  the 
fruit  of  thy  womb ! 

The  Parables  (Paremii)  are  the  same  as  at  the  Feast  of  the  Nativity  of  the 
Virgin  (see  page  164),  and  Exodus  iii.  1-8;  Prov.  viii.  22-30. 

At  Great  Compline. 

There  is  a  procession  from  the  Sanctuary,  for  the  Litiyd  (see  page  11),  after:  Glory  to 
God  in  the  highest:  hath  been  read. 

The  Stanza  for  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  I.  In  the  sixth  month  was  the 
Chieftain  of  the  Archangels  sent  unto  thee,  a  Virgin  undenled,  to  an- 
nounce unto  thee  the  word  of  salvation  and  to  proclaim  unto  thee:  Hail, 
thou  who  art  made  glad,  the  Lord  is  with  thee!  Thou  shalt  bear  the  Son 
of  the  Father  who  was  before  the  ages,  and  he  shall  save  his  people  from 
their  sins. 


202  THE  ANNUNCIATION  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  VIRGIN 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  IV.  To-day  is  the  crown  of 
our  salvation,  and  the  manifestation  of  that  mystery  which  is  from  ever- 
lasting: The  Son  of  God  becometh  the  son  of  a  Virgin,  and  Gabriel  an- 
nounceth  the  glad  tidings  of  grace.  Wherefore  let  us  also  cry  aloud  with 
him  unto  the  Birth-giver  of  God:  Hail,  thou  that  art  full  of  grace,  the 
Lord  is  with  thee ! 

The  Exaltation  (V elitchdnie) .  The  song  of  the  Archangel  sing  we  unto

the  whole  earth.

THE   CANON. 

The  First  Canon.    In  Tone  IV     {The  Blessed  Theophanius  and  St.  John  of 

Damascus.) 

Theme- Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  I  will  open  my  mouth,  and  it  shall  be  filled 
with  the  Spirit,  and  I  will  utter  a  saying  to  the  Queen-Mother.  I  will  re- 
veal myself  radiantly  keeping  high  festival,  and  with  rejoicing  will  I  sing 
her  marvels. 

III.  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  Fountain  living  and  inexhaustible!  Spirit- 
ually establish  thou  those  who  hymn  thee,  convoked  in  a  choir,  and 
vouchsafe  unto  them  crowns  of  glory  in  thy  glory  divine. 

IV.  Jesus,  the  Most  Divine,  who  sitteth  in  glory  upon  the  throne  of  the 
Godhead,  is  come,  upon  a  light  cloud  borne  by  a  palm  undefiled,  and 
hath  saved  those  who  cry :  Glory  to  thy  power,  O  Christ ! 

V.  All  things  marvelled  at  thy  glory  divine;  for  thou,  O  Virgin,  though 
thou  knewest  not  wedlock,  didst  have  in  thy  womb  God  who  is  over  all, 
and  didst  give  birth  to  the  timeless  Son,  who  granteth  peace  unto  all  that 
sing  praises  unto  thee. 

VI.  Jonah  the  Prophet,  typifying  the  three  days'  burial,  exclaimed,  as 
he  prayed  within  the  whale:  Deliver  me  from  corruption,  O  Jesus,  King 
of  the  Powers! 

VII.  The  godly-minded  ones  worshipped  not  the  creature  rather  than 
the  Creator,  but  valiantly  trampling  under  foot  the  threatened  fire,  they 
rejoiced  in  song,  saying:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  and  God  of  our  fathers, 
exceedingly  praised! 

VIII.  Hearken,  O  Maiden,  Virgin  Pure,  and  let  Gabriel  announce  the 
true  will  of  the  Most  High,  which  was  from  of  old:  Make  thou  ready  to 
receive  God;  for  through  thee  the  Uncontainable  shall  dwell  among  men. 
For  which  cause,  also,  I  cry  aloud  with  joy:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord, 
bless  ye  the  Lord! 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord:  The  Refrain:  O  Earth, 
proclaim  the  great  gladness!  and  ye  Heavens,  praise  ye  the  glory  of  God! 


THE  ANNUNCIATION  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  VIRGIN  203 

IX.  Let  no  hand  profane  in  anywise  touch  the  living  Ark  of  God;  but 
let  the  lips  of  the  faithful  unceasingly  singing  the  Salutation  of  the  Angel 
to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  cry  aloud  with  rejoicing:  Hail,  thou  that  art 
full  of  grace,  the  Lord  is  with  thee! 

The  Liturgy  at  the  Feast  of  the  Annunciation  beginneth  with  Vespers  on  those  days

after  the  Liturgy.  The  Liturgy  used  is  either  that  of  St.  John  Chrysbstom  or  of 
St.  Basil  the  Great;  never  that  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts. 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  IV.  In  the  sixth 
month  was  an  Archangel  sent  unto  a  Virgin  pure;  and  when  he  had  said 
unto  her,  Hail!  he  announced  unto  her  the  glad  tidings  that  from  her 
should  come  forth  the  Redeemer.  Wherefore,  having  received  the  salu- 
tation, she  conceived  thee,  the  God  who  is  before  the  ages,  who  in  wise 
unutterable  didst  deign  to  become  man  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls.

(PALM  SUNDAY) 

At  Vespers,  on  the  Eve. 

The  Stanzas  (Stikhiry)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  VI.  To-day 
hath  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit  assembled  us  together,  and  taking  up 
thy  cross  let  us  all  say:  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 
Hosanna  in  the  highest! 

He  who  hath  the  heavens  for  his  throne,  and  the  earth  for  his  foot- 
stool, the  coeternal  Word  and  Son  of  God  the  Father,  to-day  is  come  to 
Bethany,  and  humbled  himself  on  the  dumb  foal  of  an  ass.  For  which 
cause  the  Hebrew  children,  bearing  branches  of  trees  in  their  hands, 
exalted  him  with  the  shout:  Hosanna  in  the  highest!  Blessed  is  he  that 
cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

At  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  I.  The  all-holy  Spirit,  which  taught  the  Apostles 
to  speak  in  other  and  strange  tongues,  the  same  commandeth  the  Hebrew 
children  devoid  of  guile  to  cry  aloud:  Hosanna  in  the  highest!  Blessed 
is  the  King  of  Israel  who  cometh. 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropar).  Thou  didst  raise  Lazarus  from  the 
dead,  O  Christ-God,  making  certain  the  universal  resurrection,  before 
thy  Passion.  For  which  cause  we  also,  like  unto  the  children,  bearing  the 
emblems  of  victory,  cry  aloud  unto  thee,  the  Conqueror  of  Death: 
Hosanna  in  the  highest!  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord. 

Another.  Having  been  buried  with  thee  in  baptism,  O  Christ  our  God, 
we  have  been  vouchsafed  life  immortal  through  thy  Resurrection,  and 
singing  praises  unto  thee,  we  cry :  Hosanna  in  the  highest !  Blessed  is  he 
that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

The  Exaltation.  We  magnify  thee,  O  Life-giving  Christ!  Hosanna  in 
the  highest!  And  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee:  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in 
the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  Tone  IV.  Out  of  the  mouth  of  babes  and

the  earth.

THE  ENTRANCE  OF  THE  LORD  INTO  JERUSALEM  205 

After  the  Gospel,  Psalm  li.,  and  the  Prayer  at  the  Blessing  of  the  Palms. 
Priest.  O  Lord  our  God,  who  sittest  upon  the  Cherubim,  who  didst 
restore  the  might  of  thy  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  that  through  his 
Cross  and  Grave  and  Resurrection  he  might  save  the  world;  whom,  also, 
when  to-day  he  was  come  into  Jerusalem,  unto  his  voluntary  Passion,  the 
people  who  sat  in  darkness  and  in  the  shadow  of  death,  taking  the  symbols 
of  victory,  even  boughs  of  trees  and  branches  of  palms,  emblematical  of 
the  Resurrection,  did  go  forth  to  meet:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  preserve 
and  keep  us  also  who  on  this  eve  of  the  feast  in  imitation  of  them  do  bear 
in  our  hands  palms  and  branches  of  trees.  And  like  unto  those  multi- 
tudes and  children  who  offered  unto  thee  Hosanna !  may  we  also  in  hymns 
and  spiritual  songs,  attain  unto  the  life-giving  Resurrection  on  the  third 
day,  through  the  same  Christ  Jesus  our  Lord ;  with  whom  thou  art  blessed, 
together  with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  Priest  distributeth  the  palms  to  the  People,  after  they  have  saluted  the  Gospels  and 
received  his  benediction.  The  people  then  light  their  tapers  and  so  stand  until  the 
end  of  the  service,  holding  their  palms. 

PALM  SUNDAY. 
The  First  Canon.  In  Tone  IV.  (St.  Cosmas  of  Maium.) 
Theme- Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  The  springs  of  the  deep  were  seen  to  be 
bereft  of  water,  and  the  foundations  of  the  sea  surging  with  a  tempest 
were  laid  bare.  For  thou,  by  a  sign,  didst  lay  thine  interdiction  upon  it, 
and  didst  save  thy  chosen  people,  who  sang  a  song  of  victory  unto  thee, 
O  Lord. 

III.  The  Children  of  Israel  drank  from  the  solid  rock  which,  when  iu 
edge  was  cleft  at  thy  command,  poured  forth  water  abundantly.  But 
that  rock  and  that  life  art  thou,  O  Christ,  upon  whom  is  founded  the 
Church  which  crieth :  Hosanna !     Blessed  art  thou  who  comest. 

IV.  Christ  our  God,  who  cometh  visibly,  shall  come  and  shall  not  tarry, 
from  the  Mount  grove-shadowed,  born  of  a  Maiden  without  husband, 
saith  the  Prophet  of  old:  wherefore,  let  us  all  cry  aloud:  Glory  to  thy 
might,  O  Lord ! 

V  O  thou  who  announcest  the  good  tidings,  get  thee  up  into  the 
Mount  Zion,  and  lift  up  thy  voice  with  strength,  thou  who  proclaimest 
unto  Jerusalem:  Glorious  things  are  spoken  of  thee,  O  city  of  God;  peace 
upon  Israel,  and  salvation  unto  the  nations. 

VI .  The  spirits  of  the  righteous  have  cried  aloud  with  joy :  Now  is  a  new 
covenant  appointed  unto  the  world,  and  all  people  shall  be  renewed 
through  sprinkling  with  the  blood  divine. 

VII.  Thou  who  didst  save  thy  children  of  Abraham  in  the  fire,  and 
didst  annihilate  the  Chaldaeans,  who  were  overtaken  by  that  righteous 
judgment:  O  Lord  and  God  of  our  fathers,  exceedingly  praised,  blessed

GREAT  THURSDAY 

On  Great  Thursday  the  Church  commemorateth  the  Lord's  humbling  of  himself  for 
our  sakes:  his  washing  the  feet  of  his  disciples,  and  the  institution  of  the  dread 
Mystery  of  the  Body  and  Blood  of  Christ;  his  prayer  in  the  garden,  and  his  betrayal 
by  Judas. 

On  this  day,  in  some  cathedral  churches,  the  ceremony  of  the  Washing  of  Feet  is  per- 
formed, as  a  lesson  to  us  that  we  should  serve  one  another. 

In  the  Cathedral  of  the  Falling-asleep  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God  {the  Assumption),  in 
Moscow;  and  in  the  Monastery  of  the  Catacombs,  in  Kieff,  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
Divine  Liturgy  on  Holy  Thursday  is  consecrated  the  Holy  Chrism,  which  is  used  in 
all  Russian  churches,  in  the  Sacrament  of  Chrismation,  after  Baptism.  The  Con- 
secration of  the  Chrism  taketh  place  at  the  Altar,  after  the  Great  Entrance. 

MATINS. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 

ages. 

Then  as  usual  (see  Matins)  until:  God  is  the  Lord:  in  place  of  which  Alleluia,  in 
the  Fifth  Tone,  is  sung. 

The  Deacon  readeth  the  Verses  (Stikhi). 

I.  With  my  soul  have  I  desired  thee  in  the  night,  O  God,  before  the 
dawn:  thy  judgments  are  in  the  earth. 

Choir.  Alleluia.     (Thrice.) 

II.  The  inhabitants  of  the  earth  will  learn  righteousness.    1$ 

III.  Envy  shall  seize  the  people  who  have  not  been  chastised,    fy 

IV.  Thou  hast  increased  evil,  O  Lord,  thou  hast  increased  evil  to  the 
high  ones  of  the  earth.    Ц 

Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr).  When  the  glorious  disciples  were  illu- 
mined by  the  Washing  at  the  Supper,  then  was  the  impious  Judas,  ailing 
with  covetousness,  darkened.  And  to  the  unjust  judges  doth  he  betray 
thee,  the  just  Judge.  Behold  his  money  beloved,  for  the  sake  of  which  he 
hanged  himself.  Flee  the  insatiate  soul  which  dared  such  things  against 
the  Master.  O  Lord  who  art  good  above  all  men,  glory  to  thee.  (Tone 
VIII.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

When  the  glorious  disciples 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

When  the  glorious  disciples 

Then  the  Deacon  exclaimeth:

Then  Psalm  li.  is  read:  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great 

mercy.       .  (See  page  45.) 
The  Prayer:  0  God,  save  thy  people:  is  not  read  but  the  Singers  immediately  begin 

THE   CANON. 
In  Tone  V      (St.  Cosmas  of  Maiuml) 

The  Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  The  Red  Sea  by  a  stroke  is  parted  in 
twain,  and  the  depth  which  feedeth  the  waves  is  dried  up,  the  same  being 
trodden  by  the  unarmed,  and  becoming  a  grave  to  those  fully  armed. 
And  a  song  well-pleasing  unto  God  is  sung:  Gloriously  hath  Christ  our 
God  been  glorified ! 

III.  He  who  is  the  Lord  of  all,  and  God  the  Creator,  the  Passionless 
One,  united  the  creature  with  himself,  in  that  he  did  humble  himself;  and 
himself  becoming  the  Passover,  did  offer  himself  in  anticipation  unto 
those  on  behalf  of  whom  it  was  his  will  to  die,  crying:  Eat  ye  my  body, 
and  ye  shall  be  strengthened  in  faith. 

IV  The  Prophet,  when  he  beheld  in  a  vision  thine  ineffable  Mystery, 
O  Christ,  cried  out  in  anticipation:  Thou,  O  bountiful  Father,  didst  ap- 
point the  firm  love  of  thy  might:  for  thou  didst  give  thine  Only-begotten 
Son  to  the  world  as  an  Atonement,  O  Good  One. 

V  The  Apostles,  united  in  the  bond  of  love,  having  dedicated  them- 
selves unto  Christ  who  reigneth  over  all,  made  beautiful  their  feet  to  go 
and  proclaim  the  glad  tidings  of  peace  unto  all  the  world. 

VI.  The  nethermost  abyss  of  sins  hath  compassed  me  about,  and  un- 
able longer  to  endure  the  billows  thereof,  like  Jonah  I  cry  aloud  unto  thee, 
O  Master:  Lead  me  forth  from  corruption. 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  Tone  II.  The  Traitor,  having  taken 
bread  in  his  hand,  privily  stretched  forth  the  same,  and  taketh  a  price  for 
him  who  with  his  hands  had  made  man ;  and  Judas,  the  slave  and  the  de- 
ceiver, remaineth  reprobate. 

VII.  The  Children  in  Babylon  felt  no  fear  of  the  furnace's  flames;  but 
when  they  were  cast  into  the  midst  of  the  fire,  being  besprinkled  with  dew, 
they  cried  aloud  in  song:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers! 

VIII.  The  blessed  Youths  in  Babylon,  braving  danger  for  the  laws  of 
their  fathers,  despised  the  mad  behest  of  the  potentate;  and  when  they 
were  encompassed  by  the  fire  in  which  they  were  not  consumed,  they 


2io  GREAT  THURSDAY 

sang  a  worthy  song  unto  the  Almighty:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless 
ye  the  Lord,  and  magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages. 

Let  us  praise,  bless  and  worship  the  Lord,  hymning  and  magnifying 
him  unto  all  the  ages. 

IX.  Come,  O  ye  faithful,  let  us  enjoy  the  hospitality  and  the  banquet 
immortal  of  the  Lord,  in  the  upper  chamber,  with  minds  uplifted,  in  that 
we  have  learned  the  Word  from  the  Word  who  hath  gone  up  on  high: 
Whom  also  we  do  magnify. 

Then  the  Choir:  Exapostildrion. 

I  behold  thy  richly  adorned  dwelling-place,  O  my  Saviour,  and  I  have 
no  festal  raiment,  that  I  may  enter  in.  Illumine  thou  the  raiment  of  my 
soul,  O  Light-giver,  and  save  me. 

Glorv  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.

in  his  holiness  (Psalm  cl.). 

Glory  to  thee  who  hast  shown  us  the  light. 

Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  toward  men: 
We  praise  thee:  and  the  rest,  as  usual,  to  the  end,  as  shown  in  the  Office  for

122.) 

And  the  Many  Years. 

THE  LITURGY 

The  Liturgy,  which  is  always  that  of  St.  Basil  the  Great,  beginneth  with  Vespers. 
Vespers  is  celebrated  as  usual,  with  the  following  exceptions: 

The  Verses  (Stikhiri  )for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  I.  Bring  my  soul 
out  of  prison,  that  I  may  give  thanks  unto  thy  Name. 

The  whole  multitude  of  the  Jews  assembleth  together,  and  delivereth 
over  unto  Pilate  the  Maker  and  Creator  of  all  men.  O  iniquitous!  O 
faithless!  They  prepare  for  judgment  him  who  shall  come  to  judge  both 
the  quick  and  the  dead;  him  who  healeth  passions  they  prepare  for  his 
Passion.     O  Lord  long-suffering,  great  is  thy  mercy:  glory  to  thee. 

Out  of  the  depths  have  I  cried  unto  thee,  O  Lord:  O  Lord,  hear  my 
voice. 

Judas  the  impious,  when  at  supper  he  had  dipped  his  hand  in  the  salt 
with  thee,  O  Lord,  stretched  forth  to  the  impious  his  hand  to  receive  the 
pieces  of  silver;  and  having  meditated  upon  the  price  of  the  ointment,  was 
not  afraid  to  betray  thee,  the  Priceless  One:  For  he  stretched  forth  his 
foot  to  be  washed,  he  deceitfully  kissed  the  Master,  that  he  might  betray 
him  to  the  impious  ones;  he  was  cast  out  from  the  company  of  the 
Apostles,  and  flung  down  the  thirty  pieces  of  silver,  and  beheld  not  thy 
rising  on  the  third  day:  Through  which  show  thou  mercy  upon  us. 

If  thou,  Lord,  wilt  be  extreme  to  mark  what  is  done  amiss,  O  Lord,  who 
may  abide  it? 

Judas  the  traitor,  being  deceitful,  with  a  deceitful  kiss  did  betray  the 
Saviour,  and  Lord  and  Master  of  all  men,  in  that  he  sold  him  like  a  slave 
to  the  Jews;  like  a  sheep  to  the  slaughter  even  so  went  the  Lamb  of  God, 
the  Son  of  the  Father,  the  only  All-Merciful  One. 

My  soul  doth  wait  upon  the  Lord,  before  the  morning  watch,  I  say, 
before  the  morning  watch. 

Judas  showed  himself  a  slave  and  deceiver,  a  disciple  and  a  calumni- 
ator, a  friend  and  a  devil  in  his  deeds;  for  having  followed  the  Teacher 
and  learned  the  doctrine  from  him,  he  said  within  himself:  I  will  betray 
him,  and  acquire  the  possessions  which  he  hath  accumulated;  for  he  sought 
to  sell  the  ointment,  and  to  take  Jesus  by  guile.     He  gave  a  kiss,  he  be- 


212  GREAT  THURSDAY 

trayed  Christ.     And  like  a  sheep  to  the  slaughter,  even  so  went  the  Lamb 
of  God,  the  only  Compassionate  One  who  loveth  mankind. 

O  praise  the  Lord,  all  ye  heathen:  praise  him,  all  ye  nations. 

The  Lamb  which  was  prophesied  by  Isaiah  cometh  to  his  voluntary 
slaughter,  and  giveth  his  back  to  the  smiters  and  his  cheeks  to  buffeting, 
and  his  face  hath  he  not  turned  away  from  the  ignominy  of  the  spitting, 
and  he  is  condemned  to  a  shameful  death.  The  Sinless  One  of  his  own 
will  accepteth  all  things,  and  unto  all  men  giveth  he  resurrection  from  the 
dead. 

Glory     .     now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Tone  VI. 

Judas  was,  of  a  truth,  the  descendant  of  the  vipers  who  ate  manna  in 
the  wilderness,  and  murmured  against  Him  who  fed  them:  for  while  the 
food  was  still  in  their  mouths,  the  ingrates  spake  evil  against  God.  And 
this  godless  man,  while  he  bare  in  his  mouth  the  heavenly  bread,  com- 
mitted treachery  against  the  Saviour.  O  nature  insatiable,  and  audacity 
inhuman !  He  selleth  the  One  who  feedeth  him,  and  betrayeth  unto  death 
the  Master  who  loveth  him.  Of  a  truth  is  he  the  son  of  the  impious,  and 
with  them  hath  he  inherited  perdition.  But  spare  thou  our  souls,  O  Lord, 
from  such  inhumanity,  O  thou  who  alone  art  of  ineffable  long-suffering. 

The  Entrance  is  then  made  with  the  Gospels.

21-39;  Luke  xxii.  43-45;  Matt.  xxvi.  40,  xxvii.  1-2.

Of  thy  Mystical  Supper,  O  Son  of  God,  accept  me  to-day  as  a  commu- 
nicant; for  I  will  not  speak  of  thy  Mystery  to  thine  enemies,  neither  like 
Judas  will  I  give  thee  a  kiss;  but  like  the  thief  will  I  confess  thee:  Remem- 
ber me,  O  Lord,  in  thy  kingdom. 

And  in  place  of:  Meet  is  it: 
Come,  O  ye  faithful,  let  us  enjoy  the  hospitality  and  the  banquet  im-

unto  us  the  most  excellent  way  of  humility,  when  he  washed  the  disciples' 
feet,  and  condescended  even  unto  the  Cross,  and  burial,  Christ  our  true 
God:  and  the  rest,  as  usual.     (See  page  122.) 


GREAT  (GOOD)  FRIDAY 

On  Great  Friday  we  commemorate  the  redeeming  sufferings  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
who  for  our  sakes  voluntarily  endured  being  spat  upon,  beaten,  buffeted  in  the  face, 
jeered  at,  pierced  with  the  nails  and  the  spear,  and,  in  conclusion,  —  death  upon 
the  Cross.  Wherefore,  the  Service  for  Matins  is  entitled:  The  Office  of  the 
holy  and  redeeming  Sufferings  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  and  its  charac- 
teristic feature  consisteth  in  the  reading  of  the  Twelve  Gospels,  which  narrate  the 
same. 

Matins  beginneth  in  the  same  manner  as  on  Thursday.  While:  Alleluia,  and:  When 
the  glorious  disciples  (see  Great  Thursday)  are  being  sung,  the  Clergy 
come  forth  from  the  Sanctuary  with  the  book  of  the  Gospels  to  the  centre  of  the  Tem- 
ple, place  the  book  on  the  lectern,  light  tapers  (as  do  the  People  also),  and  cense  the 
Temple  and  those  present. 

Then  the  Little  Litany:  Again,  yet  again,  .  .  with  the  Exclamation:  For  thine  are 
the  kingdom  and  the  power 

That  he  will  graciously  vouchsafe  unto  us:  and  the  rest.     (See  page  30.) 
Glory  to  thy  Passion,  O  Lord.     (Before  each  Gospel.) 

Then  the  Gospels.  (1)  John  xiii.  31-xviii.  1.  (2)  John  xviii.  1-28.  (3)  Matt.  xxvi. 
57-75-  (4)  John  xviii.  28-xix.  16.  (5)  Matt,  xxvii.  3-32.  (6)  Mark  xv.  16-32. 
(7)  Matt,  xxvii.  33"54-  (8)  Luke  xxiii.  32-49.  (9)  John  xix.  25-37.  (™)  Mark 
xv.  43-47      (11)  John  xix.  38-42.     (12)  Matt,  xxvii.  62-66. 

Glory  to  thy  long-suffering,  O  Lord.     (After  each  Gospel.) 
After  the  first  Gospel,  the  Antiphon,  in  Tone  VIII. 

The  Princes  of  the  people  are  assembled  against  the  Lord,  and  against 
his  Christ. 

Thou  hast  laid  upon  me  the  word  of  transgression,  O  Lord:  Lord, 
forsake  me  not. 

Let  us  offer  unto  Christ  our  pure  affections,  and  as  his  friends  let  us 
sacrifice  our  souls  for  his  sake;  and  let  us  not  be  oppressed,  like  unto 
Judas,  with  the  cares  of  life,  but  in  our  closets  let  us  cry  aloud:  Our 
Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  from  the  Evil  One  deliver  thou  us. 

After  the  second  Gospel,  the  Antiphon,  in  Tone  V. 
To-day  doth  Judas  abandon  the  Master,  and  accept  the  devil:  he  is 
blinded  by  the  passion  of  cupidity;  being  darkened,  he  falleth  away  from 
the  light.  For  how  can  he  see  who,  for  thirty  pieces  of  silver,  hath  sold  the 
Light?  But  he  who  hath  suffered  for  the  world  hath  shone  upon  us. 
Unto  him  let  us  cry  aloud :  O  Lord,  who  hast  suffered,  and  who  hast  com- 
passion upon  men,  glory  to  thee. 

After  the  third  Gospel,  the  Antiphon,  in  Tone  VIII. 
Unto  those  who  unlawfully  did  seize  thee,  having  suffered  much,  thus 
didst  thou  cry,  O  Lord:  If  ye  smite  the  Shepherd,  and  scatter  abroad  the 


GREAT  FRIDAY  215 

twelve  sheep,  my  disciples,  I  might  summon  more  than  twelve  legions  of 
Angels.  But  I  will  forbear,  that  the  obscure  and  secret  things,  which  I 
have  revealed  unto  you  through  my  prophets,  may  be  fulfilled.  Glory, 
O  Lord,  to  thee. 

After  the  fourth  Gospel,  the  Antiphon,  in  Tone  VI. 
He  who  decketh  himself  with  light  as  it  were  with  a  garment,  stood 
naked  at  the  judgment  seat,  and  received  bufferings  upon  the  cheek  from 
the  hands  of  those  whom  he  had  created.  The  iniquitous  people,  also, 
did  nail  to  the  Cross  the  Lord  of  glory.  Then  was  the  veil  of  the  Temple 
rent  in  twain,  and  the  sun  was  darkened,  for  it  could  not  endure  to  behold 
affronted  God,  before  whom  all  things  do  quake.  Unto  him  let  us  bow 
down. 

After  the  fifth  Gospel,  the  Antiphon,  in  Tone  VI. 
The  assembly  of  the  Jews  besought  Pilate  to  crucify  thee,  O  Lord.  For 
though  they  found  no  fault  in  thee,  they  liberated  the  guilty  Barabbas, 
and  condemned  thee,  the  Just  One,  and  became  guilty  of  the  sin  of  foul 
murder.  But  grant,  O  Lord,  their  reward  unto  those  who  vainly  wrought 
evil  against  thee. 

But  besides  the  above  Antiphons,  between  the  reading  of  the  second,  third,  fourth, 
fifth  and  sixth  Gospels,  are  sung  three  more  Antiphons.  The  Little  Litany  and  a 
Sitting-Hymn  (Syeddlen)  are  said  and  sung;  and  the  customary  censing  of  the 
Temple  is  performed. 

After  the  sixth  Gospel,  the  Beatitudes,  with  their  Hymns  (Tropari),  are  chanted,  and 
the  Gradual  (Prokimen) : 

They  parted  my  garments  among  them,  and  upon  my  vesture  did  they 
cast  lots. 

Verse.  O  God,  my  God,  hear  me.     Why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 
After  the  seventh  Gospel,  Psalm  It.  is  read. 
After  the  eighth  Gospel,  is  sung  the  Three-Song  Canon,  in  Tone  VI. 

Theme-Song  V.  (Irmos).  My  soul  awaketh  early  unto  thee,  who 
through  tenderness  of  heart  didst  empty  thyself,  yet  without  change  of 
Essence;  and  being  thyself  without  passion,  didst  condescend  unto  thy 
Passion,  O  Word  of  God.  Grant  peace  unto  me  who  have  fallen,  O  thou 
who  lovest  mankind.     (Twice.) 

Refrain.  Glory  to  thee,  O  our  God;  glory  to  thee. 

And  its  two  Hymns,  each  six  times,  with  the  Refrain:  Glory  now,  and  ever,  . ; 
the  Theme-Song;  the  Little  Litany;  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  (see  page  217); 
and  the  Ikos.     Then, 

Theme-Song  VIII.  (Irmos).  The  divine  Children  put  to  shame  the 
Champion  of  blasphemous  wrath.  And  the  unlawful  Council  of  the 
impious,  raging  against  Christ,  took  counsel  in  vain,  when  they  sought  to 
slay  him  who  holdeth  life  in  the  hollow  of  his  hand;  whom,  also,  let  all 
creation  bless,  magnifying  him  unto  all  the  ages.    Ц 


«6  GREAT  FRIDAY 

And  its  four  Hymns,  with  the  Refrain. 
Theme-Song  IX.  (Irmos).  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and 
beyond  compare  more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  de- 
filement barest  God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

And  its  four  Hymns,  with  the  Refrain. 
The  Exapostildrion.  In  one  moment  thou  didst  graciously  vouchsafe 
Paradise  unto  the  wise  thief,  O  Lord:  Illumine  thou  me,  also,  by  the  tree 
of  the  Cross,  and  save  me. 

After  the  ninth  Gospel:  Let  everything  that  hath  breath  praise  the  Lord:  with  its 
Stanzas  (Stikhiri).    As: 

Two  treacherous  things  hath  my  first-born  son,  Israel,  done:  He  hath 
abandoned  my  fountain  of  living  water,  and  hath  digged  for  himself  a 
well  of  wretchedness;  he  hath  crucified  me  on  the  Cross,  and  hath  asked 
for  himself  and  hath  released  Barabbas.  Heaven  was  affrighted  thereat, 
and  the  sun  hid  its  rays,  but  thou,  O  Israel,  hast  not  been  ashamed,  but 
hast  delivered  me  over  unto  death.  Forgive  them,  Father;  for  they  know 
not  what  they  have  done. 

After  the  tenth  Gospel:  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  .  .  .  (see  page  34)  is  read;  then  the 
Litany:  Let  us  complete  our  morning  prayer  .  .  . 

After  the  eleventh  Gospel,  the  Canticles  of  the  Psalms.  As: 
All  creation  was  confounded  with  terror  when  it  beheld  thee  suspended 
on  the  Cross,  O  Christ.  The  sun  was  darkened,  and  the  foundations  of 
the  earth  were  shaken :  all  things  suffered  in  sympathy  with  him  who  had 
created  all  things.  O  Lord,  who  of  thine  own  good  will  didst  suffer  for  us, 
glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  final  censing. 

After  the  twelfth  Gospel,  the  ending  of  Matins. 

It  is  a  good  thing  to  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  .  .  .  O  Holy  God,  Holy 
Mighty,  .  .  .  Our  Father,  .  .  . 

The  Hymn  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  IV.  Thou  hast  ransomed  us  from  the 
curse  of  the  law  by  thy  precious  blood;  when  thou  wast  nailed  to  the 
Cross  and  pierced  with  a  spear,  thou  didst  pour  forth  immortality  for 
men,  O  our  Saviour:  glory  to  thee. 

The  Augmented  Litany,  and  the  Benediction.  May  he  who,  for  the  sake 
of  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  deigned  to  endure  terrible  sufferings, 
and  the  life-giving  Cross,  and  voluntary  burial,  Christ,  our  true  God: 
and  the  rest,  as  usual.     (See  page  122.) 

The  First  Hour  is  not  joined  to  Matins,  but  is  read  separately,  together  with  the  Third, 
Sixth  and  Ninth  Hours. 

The  Imperial  Hours.     (Composed  by  Kyril  of  Alexandria.)

God.

brought  gall  unto  thee;  but  of  thine  own  good  will  didst  thou  suffer,  and

celebrated  on  Great  Friday.  The  sacrifice,  on  that  day,  is  offered  on  Golgotha. 
(Only  in  case  the  Feast  of  the  Annunciation  falleth  on  that  day  the  Liturgy  of  St. 
John  Chrysostom  is  celebrated.) 


2i8  GREAT  FRIDAY 

VESPERS. 

Especially  affecting  is  Vespers,  which  is  celebrated  on  Great  Friday  at  four  o'clock, 
when  the  winding-sheet  (plashtschantiza)  is  brought  into  the  centre  of  the  Temple. 

Before  the  beginning  of  the  service  the  winding-sheet  is  laid  on  the  Altar.  The  Senior 
Priest  vesteth  himself  in  all  the  ecclesiastical  vestments  pertaining  to  his  rank.  The 
beginning  of  the  service  is  as  usual.   The  Stanzas  {Stikhiri)  of:  Lord,  I  have  cried: 

I.  Tone  I.  All  creation  was  confounded  with  terror  when  it  beheld 
thee  suspended  on  the  Cross,  O  Christ.  The  sun  was  darkened,  and  the 
foundations  of  the  earth  were  shaken:  all  things  suffered  in  sympathy 
with  him  who  had  created  all  things.  O  Lord,  who  of  thine  own  good 
will  didst  suffer  for  us,  glory  to  thee. 

II.  Tone  II.  To-day  the  Virgin  undefiled,  beholding  thee,  the  Word, 
uplifted  upon  the  Cross,  weeping  with  the  tender  love  of  a  mother,  was 
sore  wounded  in  heart,  and  moaned  grievously  from  the  depths  of  her 
soul,  wiping  her  face  with  her  hair.  Wherefore  also  beating  her  hands, 
she  cried  piteously:  Woe  is  me,  O  my  Son  divine!  Woe  is  me,  O  Light  of 
the  World!  Why  hast  thou  departed  from  mine  eyes,  O  Lamb  of  God? 
For  which  cause  also  the  host  of  the  Bodiless  Powers  were  seized  with 
trembling,  and  said:  O  Lord  Ineffable,  glory  to  thee! 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

III.  Tone  VI.  A  mystery  dread  and  most  glorious  to-day  is  seen  to 
be  accomplished:  he  who  is  intangible  is  held  fast;  he  who  loosed  Adam 
from  the  curse  is  bound ;  he  who  trieth  the  heart  and  reins  unlawfully  is 
tried ;  he  is  confined  in  darkness  who  confined  the  abyss ;  before  Pilate 
standeth  he  before  whom,  with  trembling,  stand  the  Powers  of  Heaven; 
the  Creator  is  buffeted  in  the  face  by  the  hand  of  the  creature;  to  the 
Tree  he  is  adjudged  who  judgeth  the  living  and  the  dead;  the  Destroyer 
of  Hell  is  confined  in  the  tomb.  O  Benignant  Lord,  who  compassion- 
ately endurest  all  things,  and  savest  all  men  from  the  curse,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Entrance  with  the  Gospels.  O  gladsome  radiance  {Page  8.) 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) .  They  parted  my  garments  among  them,  and 
upon  my  vesture  did  they  cast  lots. 

O  God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me. 

The  Parables  (Paremii).  Exodus  xxxiiir  11-23;  J°b  xlii.  12-17;  Isaiah 
lii.  13-15,  liii.  1-12,  liv.  1.

cation.    Let  us  complete       .  (See  page  35.) 

When  Joseph,  together  with  Nicodemus,  had  taken  from  the  Tree  thee, 
who  clothest  thyself  in  light  as  in  a  garment,  and  beheld  thee  dead,  naked 
and  unburied.  that  compassionate  man  was  seized  with  weeping,  and 


GREAT  FRIDAY  219 

with  lamentation  said:  Woe  is  me,  O  sweetest  Jesus,  beholding  whom  so 
little  while  ago  hanging  on  the  Cross,  the  sun  shrouded  itself  in  darkness, 
while  the  earth  did  quake  and  the  veil  of  the  Temple  was  rent  in  twain ! 
But  lo,  now  I  behold  thee,  who  for  my  sake,  of  thine  own  good  will,  hast 
endured  death.  How  shall  I  bury  thee,  O  my  God?  Or  with  what  wind- 
ing-sheet shall  I  enshroud  thee?  With  what  hands  shall  I  touch  thy 
body  incorruptible?  Or  what  songs  shall  I  sing  at  thy  forthgoing,  0 
Bountiful  One?  I  exalt  thy  sufferings,  and  in  song  will  I  glorify  thy 
burial,  with  Resurrection,  crying:  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee! 

During  this  time,  the  Senior  Priest,  accompanied  by  the  Deacon  with  a  taper,  censeth 
round  about  the  Altar,  thrice. 

Lord,  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  O  Holy  God, 

Holy  Mighty,  .  .  .  Our  Father,  .  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  .  .  .  (See 
page  13.) 

And  the  Choir  singeth: 

Noble  Joseph,  when  he  had  taken  thy  pure  Body  from  the  Tree,  did 
wrap  it  in  fine  linen  and  spices,  and  sorrowing  did  lay  it  in  a  new  sepulchre. 

An  Angel  stood  before  the  Myrrh -bearing  Women  at  the  tomb,  crying: 
Spices  are  meet  for  the  dead,  but  Christ  hath  revealed  himself  as  a 
stranger  to  corruption. 

While  these  Hymns  are  being  sung,  the  Clergy  lift  the  winding-sheet  from  the  Altar, 
and  preceded  by  assistants  bearing  tapers,  they  make  the  circuit  of  the  Altar,  bearing 
the  winding-sheet  on  their  heads.  And  they  go  to  the  centre  of  the  Temple  and  lay  it 
on  the  tomb  there  prepared.  Then  followeth  a  triple  censing  of  the  winding-sheet, 
and  of  the  whole  Temple,  and  of  those  present. 

An  address  appropriate  to  the  day  is  generally  made  here.     Then  the 

Benediction. 

May  he  who  for  the  sake  of  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  deigned  to 
endure  terrible  sufferings,  and  the  life-giving  Cross,  and  voluntary  burial, 
Christ,  our  true  God:  and  the  rest,  as  usual.     (See  page  122.) 

The  faithful,  following  the  example  of  the  Priest,  approach  the  tomb  of  the  Lord, 
kneeling  and  kissing  it. 


GREAT  SATURDAY 

On  Great  Saturday  the  Church  commemorateth  the  Burial  of  the  body  of  our  Lord 
Jesus  Christ,  and  his  descent  into  Hell.  As  a  watch  was  set  over  the  tomb  of  the 
Saviour,  in  like  manner,  during  the  whole  course  of  the  Matins  service  the  Clergy 
hardly  depart  from  the  tomb  of  the  winding-sheet;  while  during  the  Hours  and  the 
Liturgy,  all  the  exits  from  the  sanctuary  are  performed  around  the  winding-sheet; 
as,  for  example,  the  Little  and  Great  Entrances. 

The  beginning  of  Matins  is  as  usual.  While:  God  is  the  Lord :  is  being  sung,  the 
Holy  Door  is  opened,  and  the  Clergy  come  forth  to  the  centre  of  the  Temple.  The 
winding-sheet  and  the  Temple  are  censed. 

The  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  II.  I.  Noble  Joseph,  when  he  had 
taken  thy  pure  Body  from  the  Tree,  did  wrap  it  in  fine  linen  and  spices, 
and  sorrowing  did  lay  it  in  a  new  sepulchre. 

II.  When  thou  didst  descend  into  death,  O  Life  Immortal,  then  didst 
thou  annihilate  Hell  with  the  radiance  of  thy  divinity.  And  when  thou 
hadst  raised  up  the  dead  from  the  nethermost  regions,  all  the  Powers  of 
heaven  cried  aloud:  O  Life-giver,  Christ  our  God,  glory  to  thee! 

III.  An  Angel  stood  before  the  Myrrh-bearing  Women  at  the  tomb, 
crying:  Spices  are  meet  for  the  dead,  but  Christ  hath  revealed  himself  as 
a  stranger  to  corruption. 

Then,  directly  in  front  of  the  winding-sheet,  the  Seventeenth  Selection  of  Psalms  is 
read  {Psalm  cxix.  See  page  370),  each  verse  being  followed  by  Eulogies  of  the  dead 
and  buried  Lord.  This  selection  of  Psalms  is  divided  into  three  parts,  separated 
by  the  Little  Litany,  and  an  Exclamation. 

Examples  of  the  Eulogies.     Tone  V     Part  I. 

I.  Thou  didst  lay  down  thy  life  in  the  grave,  O  Christ,  and  the  Angelic 
Host  was  affrighted,  glorifying  thy  condescension. 

II.  O  Life,  how  shalt  thou  die?  How  shalt  thou  dwell  in  the  grave? 
But  thou  shalt  annihilate  the  kingdom  of  Death,  and  shalt  raise  up  the 
dead  out  of  Hell. 

III.  We  magnify  thee,  O  Jesus  the  King,  and  we  reverence  thy  burial 
and  thy  sufferings,  whereby  thou  hast  saved  us  from  corruption. 

Exclamation.  {After  the  Litany.)  For  blessed  is  thy  Name,  and  glori- 
fied is  thy  kingdom,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Part  II. 

Eulogies.  I.  Meet  is  it  that  we  should  magnify  thee,  the  Life-giver, 
who  hast  stretched  out  thy  hands  upon  the  Cross,  and  hast  shattered  the 
dominion  of  the  enemy. 


GREAT  SATURDAY  221 

Thy  hands  have  made  me,  and  fashioned  me;  give  me  understanding, 
that  I  may  learn  thy  commandments. 

II.  Meet  is  it  that  we  should  magnify  thee,  the  Creator  of  all  men:  for 
by  thy  sufferings  we  have  passionlessness,  0  thou  who  deliverest  us  from 
corruption. 

III.  The  earth  was  affrighted,  and  the  sun  hid  itself,  O  Saviour,  when 
it  beheld  thee,  the  light  which  knoweth  no  setting,  O  Christ,  entering 
into  the  grave  in  the  flesh. 

IV  Thou  didst  fall  asleep  in  the  grave,  O  Christ,  with  sleep  which  is 
natural  to  creatures,  and  from  the  heavy  sleep  of  sin  didst  raise  up  the 
human  race. 

Exclamation.  {After  the  Litany.)  For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  who 
restest  on  the  cherubimic  throne  of  glory,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe 
glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all- 
holy,  good  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Part  III.     Tone  III. 

Eulogies.  I.  All  nations  bring  a  song  to  thy  burial,  O  my  Christ. 
O  look  thou  upon  me,  and  be  merciful  unto  me,  as  thou  usest  to  do  unto 
those  that  love  thy  Name. 

II.  He  of  Arimathea,  having  taken  thee  from  the  Tree,  and  wrapped 
thee  in  a  winding-sheet,  interreth  thee  in  the  tomb. 

III.  The  Myrrh-bearing  Women  came,  most  wisely  bringing  spices 
unto  thee,  O  my  Christ. 

IV.  O  come,  all  creation,  let  us  offer  the  parting  songs  to  the  Creator. 
Exclamation.  For  thou  art  the  King  of  Peace,  O  Christ  our  God,  and 

unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from 
everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  good  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.

The  Eulogies  are  followed  by  the  Hymns,  The  company  of  the  Angels         (See 
Sunday  Matins,  page  28),  Then  Psalm  li.,  and 

the  canon.      Tone  VI. 
Theme-Songs  (Irmosl).    I.  The  children  of  those  that  were  saved,  hid 
under  the  earth  Him  who  of  old  drowned  in  the  waves  of  the  sea  the 
tormentor  pursuing.     But  let  us  like  the  virgins  sing  unto  the  Lord,  for 
gloriously  hath  he  glorified  himself. 

III.  When  Creation  beheld  thee,  who  didst  suspend  the  whole  earth 
immovably  upon  the  waters,  hanging  upon  Calvary,  it  quaked  with  great 
amaze,  and  cried:  There  is  none  holy,  save  thou,  O  Lord. 

IV.  When  Habakkuk  by  anticipation  beheld  thy  exhaustion  divine 
upon  the  Cross,  he  cried  in  amaze:  Thou  hast  destroyed  the  dominion  of 
the  mighty,  O  Good  One,  in  that  hast  joined  thyself  unto  the  company  of 
those  who  were  in  Hell :  for  thou  art  almighty. 


222  GREAT  SATURDAY 

V.  When  Isaiah  beheld  the  light  which  knoweth  no  setting  of  thy 
divine  manifestation,  that  was  graciously  made  unto  us,  O  Christ,  his 
soul  longed  for  thee  in  the  night-season,  and  he  cried:  The  dead  shall  rise, 
and  those  who  lie  in  the  grave  shall  arise,  and  all  the  earth-born  shall 
rejoice. 

VI.  Jonah  was  seized  but  was  not  held  in  the  belly  of  the  whale,  in  that 
he  represented  the  type  of  thee,  who  didst  suffer  and  give  thyself  over 
unto  burial;  and  he  came  forth  from  the  monster  as  from  a  chamber  of 
repose,  and  spake  unto  the  guards:  Ye  that  watch  vainly  and  without 
avail  have  forsaken  mercy  incarnate. 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  The  Immortal  One  who  imprisoned  the 
deep  is  beheld  dead,  and,  wrapped  with  spices  and  a  winding-sheet,  is  laid 
in  the  tomb  as  he  were  mortal ;  and  the  women  have  come  to  anoint  him 
with  spices,  weeping  bitterly  and  crying:  This  is  the  blessed  Saturday 
whereon  Christ,  having  fallen  asleep,  shall  rise  again  on  the  third  day- 

VII.  O  marvel  unutterable!  He  who  delivered  the  Holy  Children  in 
the  fiery  furnace  from  the  flames,  is  laid  dead,  bereft  of  breath,  in  the 
grave,  for  the  salvation  of  us  who  sing:  O  God  our  Redeemer!  Blessed 
art  thou. 

VIII.  Fear  with  trembling,  O  ye  heavens,  and  let  the  foundations  of 
the  earth  be  shaken !  For  lo,  he  who  dwelleth  on  high  is  numbered  among 
the  dead  and  is  lodged  in  the  narrow  grave.  Ye  Children,  bless;  ye 
Priests,  sing  praises;  ye  People,  magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages! 

IX.  Lament  not  for  me,  O  Mother,  when  thou  beholdest  in  the  tomb 
the  Son  whom,  without  seed,  thou  didst  conceive  in  thy  womb,  for  I 
shall  rise  again,  and  glorify  myself;  and  in  that  I  am  God,  I  will  raise  in 
glory  that  hath  no  ending  those  who,  with  faith  and  love,  do  magnify 
thee. 

(While  the  Canon  is  being  sung,  the  Senior  Priest  arrayeth  himself  in  his  full  vest- 
ments.) 

Holy  is  the  Lord  our  God.  .  .  .  Let  everything  which  hath  breath 
praise  the  Lord.  .  {Tone  II.)  Most  blessed  art  thou,  O  Virgin  Birth- 
giver  .  .  .  (See  page  34.) 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  who  hast  shown  us  the  light. 

Choir.  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  .  .  . 

When  the  Gloria  in  Excelsis  hath  been  finished,  and  while  the  affecting  Thrice-Holy 
(O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  )  is  being  sung,  and  all  the  bells  are  rung,  the 

Senior  Priest  taketh  from  the  winding-sheet  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  which 
lieth  thereon,  and  with  it,  beneath  the  winding-sheet,  which  is  upheld  by  the  Priests 
while  the  Deacons  cense,  he  performeth  the  procession  of  bearing  the  winding-sheet 
around  the  Church.  When  the  circuit  hath  been  completed,  they  carry  the  winding' 
sheet  back  into  the  Church,  and  the  procession  halteth  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door. 
Here  the  Exclamation:  Wisdom!  is  made,  and  the  Hymn:  Noble  Joseph,  .  .  (see 
page  220)  is  sung.  The  winding-sheet  is  then  replaced  on  the  tomb,  and  upon  the 
winding-sheet  is  laid  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels. 


GREAT  SATURDAY  223 

Then  follow:  The  Parables  (Paremii),  Ezek.  xxxvii.  1-14;  the  Epistle,  1  Cor.  v. 
6-8;  the  Gospel,  Matt,  xxvii.  62-66;  the  Augmented  Litany,  Let  us  say,  .  .  .;  and 
the  Litany  of  Supplication,  Let  us  complete     .  .  (See  page  36.) 

The  Benediction.  May  he  who,  for  the  sake  of  us  men,  and  for  our  sal- 
vation, endured  dire  sufferings,  and  the  life-giving  Cross,  and  voluntary 
burial  in  the  flesh,  Christ  our  true  God :  and  the  rest.     (See  page  122.) 

The  Choir  then  singeth  the  Stanza  (Stikhird),  in  Tone  V. 

O  come,  let  us  bless  Joseph  ever-memorable,  who  came  by  night  unto 
Pilate,  and  begged  the  Life  of  all  men :  Give  me  this  stranger,  who  hath 
not  where  to  lay  his  head;  give  me  this  stranger,  whom  a  crafty  disciple 
hath  betrayed  unto  death;  give  me  this  stranger,  whose  Mother,  when  she 
beheld  him  hanging  on  the  Cross,  cried  with  weeping,  and  with  maternal 
feeling  exclaimed:  Woe  is  me,  my  child!  Woe  is  me,  my  Light,  and  the 
beloved  of  my  bosom !  that  which  was  foretold  in  the  church  by  Simeon 
to-day  hath  come  to  pass!  A  weapon  shall  pierce  my  heart,  but  into  the 
joy  of  the  Resurrection  shall  lament  be  changed.  We  worship  thy  suffer- 
ings, O  Christ;  we  worship  thy  sufferings,  O  Christ;  we  worship  thy  suffer- 
ings, O  Christ,  and  thy  holy  Resurrection. 

Then  the  First  Hour  is  read. 

On  Great  Saturday,  the  Third,  Sixth  and  Ninth  Hours,  as  usual;  the  Hymn:  Noble 
Joseph,  .  (see  page  220);  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk):  The  Immortal  One 
who  imprisoned  the  deep  .  (See  page  222.)  The  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil  the 
Great  is  used,  and  is  celebrated  after  Vespers.  But  as  the  Vespers  refer  to  the  fol- 
lowing day,  in  it  the  joyous  songs  of  the  Resurrection  are  united  with  the  songs  of 
Great  Saturday. 

Vespers  beginneth:  Blessed  is  the  kingdom;  the  Sunday  Verses  (Stikhiri)  of  the 
First  Tone,  to:  Lord,  I  have  called;  the  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoro- 
ditchen) : 

Let  us  sing  the  praises  of  Mary,  Virgin,  Door  of  heaven,  Glory  of  all  the 
world,  sprung  forth  from  man,  who  also  bare  the  Lord;  the  Song  of  the 
Bodiless  Powers,  and  the  Enriching  of  the  faithful.  For  she  revealed 
herself  as  Heaven  and  the  Temple  of  the  Godhead.  She  destroyed  the 
bulwarks  of  enmity,  and  ushered  in  peace,  and  threw  open  the  kingdom. 
Wherefore,  in  that  we  possess  this  confirmation  of  our  faith,  we  have  a 
defender,  even  the  Lord  who  was  born  of  her.  Be  bold,  therefore,  be  bold, 
ye  people  of  God,  for  he,  the  All-Powerful,  shall  vanquish  your  foes. 

The  Entrance  is  made  with  the  Gospels.  After:  O  gladsome  radiance  (page  8) ;

Apocrypha).  During  the  reading  oj  the  concluding  verses  of  the  Fifteenth  Lesson, 
the  Choir  singeth:  Praise  ye  the  Lord,  and  exalt  him  forever. 

The  Little  Litany,  Exclamation:  For  holy  art  thou  . :  In  place  of  the  Thrice-holy: 
Ye  who  have  been  baptized  into  Christ  have  put  on  Christ.  The  Gradual,  in  the 
Fifth  Tone:  Let  all  the  earth  worship  thee,  and  sing  thee,  yea,  let  it  sing  unto 
thy  Name,  0  Most  Highest.  The  Epistle.  Romans  vi.  3-1 1.  Instead  of: 
Alleluia:  Arise,  0  God,  judge  the  earth;  for  thou  shalt  inherit  all  nations:  with 
its  Verses  (Stikhi);  (Psalm  lxxxii.). 

While  these  are  being  sung,  the  Clergy  change  their  sombre  vestments  for  light  vest- 
ments, in  preparation  for  the  reading  of  the  Gospel  concerning  Christ's  Resurrec- 
tion: Matt,  xxviii.  1-20. 

In  place  of  the  Cherubim  ic  Hymn: 

Let  all  mortal  flesh  hold  its  peace,  and  stand  with  fear  and  trembling, 
and  meditate  nothing  earthly  within  itself:  for  the  King  of  Kings  and  the 
Lord  of  Lords  cometh  to  be  slain,  and  to  give  himself  to  be  the  food  of  the 
faithful.  And  before  him  also  come  the  Angelic  Hosts  with  all  dominion 
and  power,  the  many-eyed  Cherubim,  and  the  six-winged  Seraphim, 
covering  their  faces,  and  crying  aloud  the  song:  Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia. 

The  Communion  Hymn. 

The  Lord  is  risen,  as  though  he  slept,  and  he  who  saveth  us  is  risen  from 
the  dead. 

In  place  of:  Meet  is  it: 

Lament  not  for  me,  O  Mother,  when  thou  beholdest  in  the  tomb  the 
Son  whom,  without  seed,  thou  didst  conceive  in  thy  womb:  for  I  shall 
rise  again  and  glorify  myself;  and  in  that  I  am  God,  I  will  raise  in  glory 
that  hath  no  ending  those  who  with  faith  and  love  do  magnify  thee. 

After  the  Liturgy  it  is  customary  to  have  the  Blessing  of  the  Loaves  and  the  Wine, 
wherewith  the  faithful  may  strengthen  themselves  before  they  listen  to  the  reading  of 
the  Acts  of  the  Apostles. 

In  the  evening  the  reading  of  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  taketh  place.  The  Priest  be- 
stoweth  the  blessing:  Through  the  prayers  of  our  holy  fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus 
Christ  our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Then  followeth  the  reading  of  the  Acts.  It  is  the  custom  to  have  a  number  of  readers, 
who  succeed  one  another,  and  read  the  Acts  until  the  very  beginning  of  the  Easter 
Midnight  Service  (Polunotchnitza),  which  precedeth  the  Easter  Matins. 

The  Easter  Midnight  Service  generally  beginneth  in  such  a  way  that  it  shall  be  finished 
at  midnight,  as  the  beginning  of  the  Easter  Refrain  is  always  made  to  coincide  with 
the  midnight  stroke  of  the  bells.     The  order  of  the  Midnight  Service  is  as  followeth: 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  Reader.  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .;  Our 
Father,  .;  O  come,  let  us  worship  .;  the  Canon  of  Great  Saturday:  The 
children  of  those     .  .  (See  page  221.) 


GREAT  SATURDAY  225 

While:  Lament  not  for  me,  0  Mother,  (the  Ninth  Theme-Song)  is  being  sung, 

the  Priest  reverently  beareth  the  winding-sheet  from  the  centre  of  the  Temple  to  the 
Sanctuary,  and  layeth  it  on  the  Altar.     Then  the  doors  are  closed.     The  Litany: 
Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,       . ;  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Might)-,       . ;  Our  Father, 
.     .;  the  Hymn  (Tropdr)  in  Tone  II.,  When  thou  didst  descend  into  Hell, 
{see  page  220)  for  Sunday;  the  Little  Benediction. 


EASTER 

Easter,  the  Feast  of  Feasts,  is  celebrated  by  the  Church  with  special  solemnity.  The 
Temple  is  filled  with  the  fragrance  of  incense  and  myriads  of  lights;  the  Clergy  are 
arrayed  in  their  choicest  light-hued  vestments.  All  the  People  hold  lighted  tapers  in 
their  hands.  All  these  things  denote  the  flood  of  joy  and  grace  which  proceeded  from 
the  Resurrection  of  the  Saviour. 

At  midnight  the  Holy  Door  is  opened;  and  it  remaineth  open  for  the  whole  of  Easter 
week.  The  Rector,  with  the  censer  and  the  triple  candlestick  and  cross,  censeth  the 
Altar;  then,  accompanied  by  his  fellow-clergy,  who  bear  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels 
and  the  holy  images,  and  the  Deacons  who  cense,  and  preceded  by  a  procession  of  the 
cross  with  the  church  banners  and  lights,  he  goeth  forth  from  the  church,  all  singing 
with  him  the  chant  of  joy:  The  Angels  in  heaven,  0  Christ  our  Saviour,  sing  thy 
Resurrection.  This  chant  is  taken  up  and  continued  by  the  Choir  and  the  People 
thus:  And  do  thou  enable  us  on  earth  to  glorify  thee  with  a  pure  heart. 

They  triumphantly  make  the  circuit  of  the  church,  the  bells  pealing  the  while,  and 
then  all  enter  the  porch,  the  doors  leading  tnerefrom  into  the  Temple  remaining 
closed.  Across  this  western  door  the  procession  rangeth  itself  with  the  Gospels,  and 
images;  and  the  Priest,  holding  the  censer  in  his  right  hand,  and  the  triple  candle- 
stick with  the  cross  in  his  left,  censeth  the  Holy  Things,  and  the  Brethren,  and  all 
the  People,  and  also  the  closed  door,  in  the  form  of  a  cross.    After  this  he  beginneth: 

Glory  to  the  Holy,  Consubstantial,  Life-giving  and  Undivided  Trinity, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death, 
and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life.     {Thrice.) 

And  the  Choirs  sing  this  thrice  also.     Then  the  Priest  intoneth  the  Verses: 
I :  Let  God  arise,  and  let  his  enemies  be  scattered,  and  let  them  also 
that  hate  him  flee  before  him. 

And  after  each  Verse  the  Choirs  respond: 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and 
upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

2:  Like  as  the  smoke  vanisheth,  so  shall  they  vanish,  and  like  as  wax 
melteth  at  the  fire.   Ц 

3:  Even  so  let  the  ungodly  perish  at  the  presence  of  God,  but  let  the 
righteous  rejoice.    Ц 

4:  This  is  the  day  which  the  Lord  hath  made:  we  will  rejoice  and  be 
glad  in  it.  Ц 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,    fy 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.   fy 

Then  the  Priest  chanteth,  in  a  louder  voice: 
Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death. 


EASTER  22? 

Then  the  closed  doors  are  opened,  and  the  Priest  entereth  with  the  honourable  cross, 
preceded  by  the  tapers,  and  by  the  Brethren  singing: 

And  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

And  thereupon  the  Priests  go  to  the  holy  Sanctuary* 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany  of  Peace  {page  26). 

Exclamation. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and 

to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Amen. 

Then  the  principal  Priest  beginneth  the  Canon,  composed  by  St.  John  of  Damascus. 
And  at  the  beginning  of  the  Canon  the  Priest  censeth  the  holy  pictures,  and  the 
Choirs,  and  the  Brethren,  according  to  their  rank. 

And  if  the  Feast  of  the  Annunciation  chance  to  fall  on  Easter  Day  {in  which  case  the 
Feast  is  called  Kiriopaskha),  the  Hymns  for  the  Annunciation  are  added  to  those 
for  Easter. 

THE   CANON. 

{During  each  Theme-Song  the  Priest  censeth.) 

Canticle  I.,  Tone  I. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  The  Day  of  Resurrection!  Let  us  be  illumined, 
O  ye  people !  The  Passover,  the  Passover  of  the  Lord !  From  death  unto 
life,  and  from  earth  unto  heaven  hath  Christ  our  God  brought  us  over, 
singing  a  song  of  victory ! 

Refrain.  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead ! 

Hymn  {Tropdr).  Let  us  purify  our  senses  and  we  shall  behold  Christ, 
radiant  with  the  light  ineffable  of  the  Resurrection,  and  shall  hear  him 
say,  in  accents  clear:  Rejoice!  as  we  sing  the  song  of  victory. 

Refrain.  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead ! 

Hymn.  For  meet  is  it  that  the  heavens  should  rejoice,  and  that  the 
earth  should  be  glad,  and  that  the  whole  world,  both  visible  and  invisible, 
should  keep  the  Feast.     For  Christ  is  risen,  the  everlasting  joy! 

The  Choirs.  The  Day  of  Resurrection ! 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and 
upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life.     {Thrice.) 

The  Little  Litany. 
Deacon.  Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

*  It  is  customary  to  make  the  circuit  of  the  church  outside,  to  typify  the  women  who 
came,  very  early  in  the  morning,  bearing  spices,  to  anoint  the  body  of  our  Lord.  The  Easter 
Matins  are  thus  begun  outside  the  church,  in  memory  of  the  Myrrh-bearing  Women  and 
the  disciples  having  first  received  tidings  of  Christ's  resurrection  before  the  entrance  to  his 
tomb. 


228  EASTER 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  majesty,  and  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the 
power  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Canticle  III. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  O  come,  let  us  quaff  a  beverage  new,  not  from  a 
barren  rock  miraculously  called  forth;  but  the  Fountain  of  Immortality 
springing  from  the  tomb  of  Christ:  on  whom  also  we  are  founded. 

Refrain.  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead ! 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  Now  are  all  things  filled  with  light;  heaven,  and  earth, 
and  the  places  under  the  earth.  All  Creation  doth  celebrate  the  Resur- 
rection of  Christ,  on  whom  also  it  is  founded.    1$ 

Hymn.  Yesterday,  O  Christ,  was  I  buried  with  thee,  and  to-day  I  rise 
again  with  thy  rising.  Yesterday  was  I  crucified  with  thee:  Do  thou 
thyself  glorify  me,  O  Saviour,  in  thy  kingdom.    Ц

Ipakoi,  Tone  III. 

When  they  who  from  Mary  came,  forestalling  the  dawn,  and  found  the 
stone  rolled  away  from  the  sepulchre,  they  heard  from  the  Angel: Why 
seek  ye  among  the  dead,  as  he  were  mortal,  him  who  abideth  in  everlast- 
ing light?  Behold  the  grave-clothes.  Go  quickly,  and  proclaim  to  the 
world  that  the  Lord  is  risen,  and  hath  slain  Death.  For  he  is  the  Son  of 
God  who  saveth  mankind.

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk). 

Though  thou  didst  descend  into  the  grave,  O  Deathless  One,  yet  didst 
thou  annihilate  the  power  of  Hell,  and  didst  rise  again  as  conqueror, 
O  Christ-God,  announcing  unto  the  Myrrh-bearing  Women:  Rejoice!  and 
giving  peace  unto  thine  Apostles,  and  bestowing  Resurrection  upon  the 
fallen. 

The  Ikos. 

The  Myrrh-bearing  Women  forestalled  the  dawn,  ere  the  rising  of  the 
sun,  seeking,  as  it  were  day,  the  Sun  which  had  once  set  in  the  tomb,  and 
crying  one  to  another:  O  friends!  Come,  let  us  anoint  with  sweet-smell- 
ing spices  the  life-bringing  and  buried  body  of  him  who  raiseth  again  in  the 
flesh  fallen  Adam,  which  lieth  in  the  grave.  Let  us  go,  let  us  seek,  like  the 
Wise  Men,  and  let  us  fall  down  in  worship  before  him,  and  bring  unto  him 
an  offering  of  myrrh;  not  unto  him  in  swaddling-clothes,  but  in  his  wind- 
ing-sheet. And  let  us  weep  and  cry  aloud:  Arise,  O  Master,  who  givest 
Resurrection  unto  the  fallen ! 

In  that  we  have  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  Christ,  let  us  bow  down 
before  the  holy  Lord  Jesus,  the  only  sinless  One.  Thy  Cross  do  we  adore, 
O  Christ,  and  thy  holy  Resurrection  we  laud  and  glorify:  for  thou  art 
our  God,  and  we  know  none  other  beside  thee,  we  call  upon  thy  Name. 
O  come,  all  ye  faithful,  let  us  adore  Christ's  holy  Resurrection:  for  lo, 
through  the  Cross  is  joy  come  into  all  the  world.  Ever  blessing  the  Lord, 
let  us  sing  his  Resurrection:  for  in  that  he  endured  the  Cross,  he  hath 
destroyed  Death  by  death.

unto  us  life  eternal,  and  great  mercy.     (Thrice.)

Hymn.  The  Day  of  Resurrection !  Let  us  be  illumined  with  the  solemn

And  this  is  sung  many  times,  while  the  People  exchange  the  Easter  kiss.  The  manner 
of  the  Clergy's  saluting  one  another  within  the  holy  Sanctuary  is  as  followeth:  He 
who  cometh  to  kiss  the  Senior  Priest  saith:  Christ  is  risen!  And  he  receiveth  the 
reply:  He  is  risen  indeed !  Then  the  Senior  Priest,  taking  the  holy  cross,  standeth 
outside,  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door.  And  all  the  Priests,  whatever  may  be  their 
number,  and  the  Deacons,  each  holding  one  of  the  Holy  Things  {the  book  of  the 
Holy  Gospels,  and  the  holy  pictures  {ikoni),  according  to  their  several  ranks),  take 
their  places  in  line,  on  the  right  hand  of  the  Senior  Priest.  The  People  then  ap- 
proach, one  by  one;  and  bowing  slightly  to  the  Priest,  they  kiss  the  holy  cross,  the 
Gospels  and  the  holy  pictures  which  the  Clergy  hold.     Then  they  kiss  the  Priest 


EASTER  235 

himself,  saying:  Christ  is  risen !    And  he  replieth:  He  is  risen  indeed !    And  in  the 
same  manner  they  kiss  the  other  Clergy,  and  one  another. 
And  after  the  salutation  is  finished,  the  Senior  Priest  readeth  the  Catechetical  Address 
of  St.  John  Chrysostom.    And  the  People  shall  not  sit  while  it  is  being  read,  but 
shall  listen  to  it  standing. 

If  any  man  be  devout  and  loveth  God,  let  him  enjoy  this  fair  and 
radiant  triumphal  feast.  If  any  man  be  a  wise  servant,  let  him  rejoicing 
enter  into  the  joy  of  his  Lord.  If  any  have  laboured  long  in  fasting,  let 
him  now  receive  his  recompense.  If  any  have  wrought  from  the  first 
hour,  let  him  to-day  receive  his  just  reward.  If  any  have  come  at  the 
third  hour,  let  him  with  thankfulness  keep  the  feast.  If  any  have  arrived 
at  the  sixth  hour,  let  him  have  no  misgivings;  because  he  shall  in  nowise 
be  deprived  therefor.  If  any  have  delayed  until  the  ninth  hour,  let  him 
draw  near,  fearing  nothing.  If  any  have  tarried  even  until  the  eleventh 
hour  let  him,  also,  be  not  alarmed  at  his  tardiness;  for  the  Lord,  who  is 
jealous  of  his  honour,  will  accept  the  last  even  as  the  first;  he  giveth  rest 
unto  him  who  cometh  at  the  eleventh  hour,  even  as  unto  him  who  hath 
wrought  from  the  first  hour.  And  he  showeth  mercy  upon  the  last, 
and  careth  for  the  first;  and  to  the  one  he  giveth,  and  upon  the  other  he 
bestoweth  gifts.  And  he  both  accepteth  the  deeds,  and  welcometh  the 
intention,  and  honoureth  the  acts  and  praiseth  the  offering.  Wherefore, 
enter  ye  all  into  the  joy  of  your  Lord;  and  receive  ye  your  reward,  both 
the  first,  and  likewise  the  second.  Ye  rich  and  poor  together,  hold  ye  high 
festival.  Ye  sober  and  ye  heedless,  honour  ye  the  day-  Rejoice  to-day, 
both  ye  who  have  fasted  and  ye  who  have  disregarded  the  fast.  The 
table  is  full-laden ;  feast  ye  all  sumptuously.  The  calf  is  fatted ;  let  no  one 
go  hungry  away-  Enjoy  ye  all  the  feast  of  faith :  Receive  ye  all  the  riches 
of  loving-kindness.  Let  no  one  bewail  his  poverty,  for  the  universal 
kingdom  hath  been  revealed.  Let  no  one  weep  for  his  iniquities,  for 
pardon  hath  shone  forth  from  the  grave.  Let  no  one  fear  death,  for  the 
Saviour's  death  hath  set  us  free.  He  that  was  held  prisoner  of  it,  hath 
annihilated  it.  By  descending  into  Hell,  he  made  Hell  captive.  He 
angered  it  when  it  tasted  of  his  flesh.  And  Isaiah,  foretelling  this,  did  cry: 
Hell,  said  he,  was  angered,  when  it  encountered  thee  in  the  lower  regions. 
It  was  angered,  for  it  was  abolished.  It  was  angered,  for  it  was  mocked. 
It  was  angered,  for  it  was  slain.  It  was  angered,  for  it  was  overthrown. 
It  was  angered,  for  it  was  fettered  in  chains.  It  took  a  body,  and  met  God 
face  to  face.  It  took  earth,  and  encountered  Heaven.  It  took  that  which 
was  seen,  and  fell  upon  the  unseen.  O  Death,  where  is  thy  sting?  O 
Hell,  where  is  thy  victory?  Christ  is  risen,  and  thou  art  overthrown. 
Christ  is  risen,  and  the  demons  are  fallen.  Christ  is  risen,  and  the  Angels 
rejoice.  Christ  is  risen,  and  life  reigneth.  Christ  is  risen,  and  not  one 
dead  remaineth  in  the  grave.  For  Christ,  being  risen  from  the  dead,  is 
become  the  first-fruits  of  those  who  have  fallen  asleep.  To  him  be  glory 
and  dominion  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


236  EASTER 

Then  is  sung  the  Hymn  of  St.  John  Chrysostom. 

The  grace  of  thy  lips,  shining  forth  like  a  beacon-fire,  .  .  .  (See  the 
Liturgy,  page  125.) 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Augmented  Litany. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  0  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  .  .  .  (See 
Matins,  page  35)  and:  Let  us  complete  our  morning  prayer  unto  the  Lord.

The  People.  And  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

And  straightway  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Benediction. 

May  Christ  who  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by 

death,  and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life,  our  true  God,  through 

the  prayers  of  his  most  pure  Mother,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy 

upon  us  and  bless  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

Then  elevating  the  cross,  he  saith:  Christ  is  risen!     (Thrice.)     And  the  People  reply: 
He  is  risen  indeed !     (Thrice.) 

Then  the  closing  Hymn  is  sung. 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and 

upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life.     And  unto  us  hath  he  given  life 

eternal.  Wherefore,  let  us  adore  his  Resurrection  on  the  third  day 

And  the  Many  Years. 

THE  HOURS  AT  EASTER. 

During  Easter  week,  until  Saturday,  the  Hours  are  read  in  the  following  order:

In  that  we  have  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  Christ,  let  us  bow  down 
before  the  holy  Lord  Jesus,  the  only  sinless  One.  Thy  Cross  do  we  adore, 
O  Christ,  and  thy  holy  Resurrection  we  laud  and  glorify.  For  thou  art 
our  God,  and  we  know  none  other  beside  thee,  we  call  upon  thy  Name. 
O  come,  all  ye  faithful,  let  us  adore  Christ's  holy  Resurrection :  for  lo,

let  us  sing  his  Resurrection.  For  in  that  he  endured  the  Cross,  he  hath 
destroyed  Death  by  death.     {Thrice.) 

Ipakoi. 
When  they  who  with  Mary  came,  forestalling  the  dawn,  and  found  the 
stone  rolled  away  from  the  sepulchre,  they  heard  from  the  Angel:  Why 
seek  ye  among  the  dead,  as  he  were  mortal,  him  who  abideth  in  ever- 
lasting light?  Behold  the  grave-clothes.  Go  quickly,  and  proclaim  to 
the  world  that  the  Lord  is  risen,  and  hath  slain  Death.  For  he  is  the  Son 
of  God  who  saveth  mankind. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk). 
Though  thou  didst  descend  into  the  grave,  O  Deathless  One,  yet  didst 
thou  annihilate  the  power  of  Hell,  and  didst  rise  again  as  conqueror,  O 
Christ-God,  announcing  unto  the  Myrrh-bearing  Women :  Rejoice!  and 
giving  grace  unto  thine  Apostles,  and  bestowing  Resurrection  upon  the 
fallen. 

And  the  Hymns  (Tropari). 

In  the  Grave  with  the  body,  and  in  Hell  with  the  soul,  in  that  thou  art 
God ;  in  Paradise  with  the  thief,  and  on  the  throne  with  the  Father  and 
the  Spirit,  wast  thou,  O  Christ,  filling  all  things,  in  that  thou  art  infinite. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

As  life-bearing,  as  of  a  truth  than  Paradise  more  fair,  and  than  every 
royal  palace  more  bright  hath  been  revealed  thy  tomb,  the  source  of  our 
Resurrection,  O  Christ. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) . 

Hail,  O  thou  hallowed,  divine  abode  of  the  Most  High!  For  through 
thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  was  joy  given  unto  those  who  cry  aloud  to 
thee:  Blessed  art  thou  among  women,  O  Lady  all-undefiled ! 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Forty  times.)     Glory         now,  and  ever,     . 

More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more 
glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

In  the  Name  of  the  Lord  bless,  Father.

The  Gospel  is:  John  i.  1-19:  which  setteth  forth  the  divinity  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 
And,  as  our  Lord  gave  command  that  his  Gospel  should  be  preached  throughout  the 
world,  to  every  creature,  it  is  customary,  on  Easter  Day,  to  read  it  in  as  many 
languages  as  possible;  especially  in  Hebrew,  Greek  and  Latin,  the  tongues  in  which 
was  written  the  superscription  on  the  cross.

The  Benediction  is  the  same  as  at  the  end  of  Matins. 

After  the  Prayer  before  the  Tribune,  at  the  end^  of  the  Divine  Liturgy,  the  Artos  is 
brought  to  the  Priest  in  the  Sanctuary.  The  Artos,  or  universal  altar-bread,  beareth 
the  image  of  the  cross,  and,  sometimes,  a  representation  of  Christ's  Resurrection. 
As  the  Paschal  Lamb,  by  God's  command,  commemorated  in  the  Old  Testament  the 
deliverance  of  his  people  from  bondage  to  Pharaoh,  and,  also,  the  Lamb  which  taketh 
away  the  sins  of  the  world;  so,  in  commemoration  of  the  Resurrection  in  the  New 
Testament  of  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  whereby  we  are  freed  from  eternal  bondage  to 
the  enemy,  the  Artos  is  offered,  symbolizing  the  angelic  bread,  the  Bread  of  Eternal 
Life,  which  came  down  from  heaven;  even  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  During  the 
whole  of  Easter  week  the  Artos  lieth  on  the  Altar,  or  on  the  lectern,  with  the  holy 
picture  (ikona)  of  the  Lord's  Resurrection.  On  Saturday,  after  the  Liturgy,  the 
Artos  is  broken  up  and  distributed. 

The  Prayer  at  the  Blessing  of  the  Artos. 
O  God  Omnipotent  and  Lord  Almighty,  who  by  thy  servant  Moses,  at 
the  exodus  of  Israel  from  Egypt,  and  the  liberation  of  thy  people  from  the 
bitter  bondage  of  Pharaoh,  didst  command  that  a  Lamb  be  slain,  fore- 


240  EASTEP 

shadowing  the  Lamb  which,  because  of  our  deeds,  of  his  own  good  will, 
was  slain  on  the  cross,  and  taketh  away  the  sins  of  the  whole  world,  thy 
beloved  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ:  Do  thou  now,  also,  we  humbly  en- 
treat thee,  look  upon  this  bread,  and  bless  and  sanctify  it.  For  we  thy 
servants,  in  honour,  and  glory,  and  commemoration  of  the  glorious  Resur- 
rection of  the  same,  thy  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  through  whom,  also,  we 
have  received  freedom  and  release  from  the  eternal  works  of  the  enemy 
and  the  indissoluble  bonds  of  Hell,  now  before  thy  majesty,  on  this  ex- 
ceeding bright,  and  all-glorious,  and  saving  day  of  Easter,  do  offer  this. 
Vouchsafe  that  we  who  offer  it,  and  those  who  shall  kiss  it  and  shall  taste 
of  it,  may  be  partakers  of  thy  heavenly  benediction ;  and  by  thy  might 
root  out  from  us  all  sickness  and  infirmity,  granting  health  unto  all.  For 
thou  art  the  source  of  blessing,  and  the  bestower  of  health,  and  unto  thee 
do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  together  with 
thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  immediately  the  Priest  sprinkleth  the  Artos  with  holy  water,  saying: 

This  Artos  is  blessed  and  hallowed  by  the  sprinkling  of  this  holy  water/ 
in  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  Amen. 
(Thrice.) 

Then  he  cometh  forth,  and  layeth  it  on  the  folding  stand;  and  the  People,  as  they  receive 
the  Antidoron,  kiss  the  Artos. 

The  Prayer  at  the  Breaking  of  the  Artos  on  Saturday  of  the  Bright  Week. 

After  the  Divine  Liturgy,  when,  in  front  of  the  stand  upon  which  the  Artos  lieth, 
Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and  upon  those 
in  the  tomb  bestowing  life:  hath  been  sung  thrice;  and  after:  Our  Father,  who  art 
in  heaven:  hath  been  read,  with  a  reverence,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.     The  Brethren.    Lord,  have  mercy. 

Then  the  Priest  saith  this  Prayer  over  the  Artos: 

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  the  Angelic  Bread,  the  Bread  of  life 
eternal,  who  came  down  from  heaven,  and  hast  fed  us  on  these  most- 
bright  days  with  the  spiritual  food  of  thy  divine  benefits,  for  the  sake  of 
thy  three  days'  burial  and  redeeming  Resurrection:  Look  now  also,  we 
humbly  entreat  thee,  upon  our  prayers  and  thanksgivings;  and  as  thou 
didst  bless  the  five  loaves  in  the  wilderness,  so  now  also  do  thou  bless  this 
bread,  that  all  who  shall  partake  of  it  may  be  vouchsafed  bodily  and 
spiritual  health  and  blessing,  through  the  grace  and  bounties  of  thy  love 
toward  mankind.  For  thou  art  our  sanctification,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

The  Brethren.  Amen. 


EASTER  24I 

And  having  broken  the  Artos  in  the  usual  manner,  he  distributeth  it  to  all,  before  their 
meal.  He  may  also  break  it  during  the  Liturgy,  after  the  Prayer  before  the  Tribune, 
and  distribute  it  to  the  faithful,  instead  of  the  Antidoron. 

The  Prayer  at  the  Blessing  of  Flesh-Meat  in  the  Holy  and  Great  Week  of 
Easter. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead,  trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and  upon 
those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life.    {Thrice.) 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Lord,  have  mercy. 

Look  down,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  upon  these  flesh-meats,  and 
sanctify  them,  as  thou  didst  sanctify  the  ram  which  faithful  Abraham 
offered  unto  thee,  and  the  lamb  which  Abel  brought  unto  thee  as  a  burnt- 
offering;  likewise  the  fatted  calf  which  thou  didst  command  to  be  slain  for 
thy  son  who  had  gone  astray,  and  had  returned  again  to  thee;  that  even  as 
he  was  accounted  worthy  to  enjoy  thy  good  things,  so  may  we,  also,  en- 
joy these  things  which  are  sanctified  and  blessed  by  thee,  to  the  nourish- 
ment of  us  all.  For  thou  art  our  true  nourishment,  and  the  Giver  of  all 
good  things,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father, 
who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-Holy,  good  and  life-giving  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  Prayer  at  the  Blessing  of  Cheese  and  Eggs. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  the  Creator  and  Maker  of  all  things:  Bless 
thou  this  curdled  milk,  and  likewise  these  eggs;  and  preserve  us  in  thy 
loving-kindness.  That  as  we  partake  of  them,  even  so,  also,  we  may  be 
filled  with  thy  gifts,  which  ungrudgingly  thou  bestowest,  and  with  thine 
unspeakable  goodness.  For  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power  and  the 
glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

THE  ASCENSION  OF  OUR  LORD  JESUS  CHRIST 

(THE  FORTIETH  DAY  AFTER  EASTER) 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  VI.  The  Lord 
hath  ascended  into  heaven,  that  he  may  send  the  Comforter  unto  the 
world.  The  heavens  have  prepared  his  throne,  the  clouds  his  ascension. 
The  Angels  marvel,  beholding  a  man  exalted  over  them.  The  Father 
awaiteth  him  whom,  as  coeternal,  he  hath  in  his  bosom;  and  the  Holy 
Spirit  commandeth  all  his  Angels:  Lift  up  your  gates,  ye  Princes;  clap 
your  hands,  all  ye  nations,  for  Christ  is  ascended  up  to  the  place  where  he 
was  before.     {Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Tone  VI.  O  sweetest  Jesus,  who,  without  leaving  the  bosom  of  the 
Father,  hast,  as  a  man,  dwelt  among  the  earth-born,  to-day  art  thou  as- 
cended in  glory  from  the  Mount  of  Olives,  and  graciously  hast  borne  on 
high  our  fallen  nature,  and  hast  sat  down  with  the  Father.  For  which 
cause  the  Bodiless  Powers  of  heaven,  amazed  at  the  marvel,  were 
affrighted  with  dread,  and  seized  with  trembling,  they  magnified  thy 
love  toward  mankind.  With  them  also,  we  earth-born,  glorifying  thy 
condescension  toward  us,  and  thine  Ascension  from  us,  pray,  saying: 
Do  thou,  who,  at  thine  Ascension,  didst  fill  with  joy  unutterable  thy 
disciples  and  the  Birth-giver  of  God  who  bare  thee,  vouchsafe  unto  us, 
thine  elect,  joy  also,  through  their  prayers,  because  of  thy  great  mercy.

but  abiding  uninterruptedly  with  us,  and  crying  unto  those  who  love  thee: 
I  am  with  you,  and  none  shall  prevail  against  you.

The  Angels,  when  they  beheld  the  Ascension  of  the  Lord,  were  amazed

PENTECOST  (WHITSUNDAY) 

The  date  of  Pentecost  is  regulated  by  the  date  of  Easter.  But  that  Sunday  is  called 
The  Day  of  the  Holy  Trinity.  The  Feast  of  the  Holy  Spirit  {in  that  He  is  separate, 
yet  equal  in  essence,  honour  and  glory  with  the  Father  and  the  Son)  is  celebrated  on 
the  following  day,  Monday,  and  is  called  the  Day  of  the  Spirit. 

It  is  customary  to  decorate  churches  and  houses  at  this  Feast  with  freshly  cut  trees  and 
flowers,  and  to  stand  at  the  Divine  Liturgy  holding  flowers.  This  custom  is  founded 
upon  that  of  the  Old  Testament  Church  {Lev.  xxiii.  10-17;  Num.  xxviii.  16) .  The 
trees  and  flowers,  the  tokens  of  the  renewal  of  Nature  in  the  Spring,  typify  also  the 
renewal  of  mankind  through  the  indwelling  0 '  the  Holy  Spirit. 

The  special  features  in  the  celebration  of  this  ^sast  consist  of  certain  petitions  in  the 
Litany;  and  of  Prayers  recited  kneeling  at  Vespers,  which  as  a  rule,  immediately 
followeth  the  Liturgy. 

At  the  Ail-Night  Vigil. 

The  Stanza  {Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  I.  Let  us  cele- 
brate Pentecost,  and  the  coming  of  the  Spirit,  and  the  appointed  day  of 
promise,  and  the  fulfilment  of  hope,  and  the  mystery  which  is  as  great  as 
it  is  precious.  Wherefore  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  the  Maker  of  all  things,  do 
we  cry:  Glory  to  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Come,  O  ye  people,  let  us  worship  the  Godhead  in  three  Persons,  the 
Son  in  the  Father  with  the  Holy  Spirit.  For  the  Father  before  time  was 
begat  the  Son,  who  is  coeternal  and  is  equally  enthroned,  and  the  Holy 
Spirit  who  was  in  the  Father,  and  was  glorified  together  with  the  Son ;  one 
Might,  one  Essence,  one  Godhead.  Adoring  the  same  let  us  all  say:  O 
Holy  God,  who  by  the  Son  didst  make  all  things  through  the  cooperation 
of  the  Holy  Spirit:  O  Holy  Mighty  One,  through  whom  we  have  known 
the  Father,  and  through  whom  the  Holy  Spirit  came  into  the  world:  O 
Holy  Immortal  One,  the  Spirit  of  comfort,  who  proceedest  from  the 
Father,  and  restest  in  the  Son:  O  Holy  Trinity,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  {Paremii).  Num.  xi.  16,  17,  24-29;  Joel  ii.  23-32;  Ezek. 
xxxvi.  24-28. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiya,  in  Tone  VIII.  When  thou  didst  send  thy 
Spirit,  O  Lord,  while  the  Apostles  sat  together,  then  were  the  Hebrew 
children  affrighted  with  dread  as  they  gazed ;  for  they  heard  them  speak 
one  to  another  in  strange  tongues,  as  the  Spirit  gave  them  utterance. 
For  though  unlearned  they  were  made  wise,  and  bringing  the  Gentiles 
unto  the  faith,  proclaimed  things  divine.    Wherefore,  we  also  do  cry  unto 


246  PENTECOST 

thee,  O  Lord,  who  hast  revealed  thyself  upon  earth,  and  hast  saved  us 
from  guile:  Glory  to  thee. 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  VIII.  Blessed  art  thou,  O 
Christ-God,  who  hast  revealed  fishers  most  wise,  sending  down  upon 
them  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  thereby  catching  the  universe  as  in  a  net.  O 
Christ-God,  who  lovest  mankind,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  When  the  Most  High  confounded  the 
tongues,  he  dispersed  the  nations:  but  when  he  distributed  the  tongues  of 
fire,  he  called  all  men  unto  unity.  Wherefore,  with  one  accord,  we  glorify 
the  All-holy  Spirit. 

The  Exaltation  (Velitchanie) .  We  magnify  thee,  O  life-giving  Christ, 
and  do  homage  to  thine  all-holy  Spirit,  whom  thou  didst  send  from  the 
Father  upon  thy  disciples  divine. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  Thy  good  spirit  shall  lead 
me  into  the  land  of  righteousness. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  O  Lord,  hear  my  prayer,  give  ear  to  my  petition. 

The  Gospel.  John  xx.  19-23. 

THE   CANON. 
Tone  IV      (St.  Cosmas  of  Malum.) 
Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).    I.  He  who  shattereth  the  enemies  with  his  lofty 
arm  overwhelmed  with  the  sea  Pharaoh  and  his  chariots:  To  him  let  us 
sing,  for  gloriously  hath  he  been  glorified. 

III.  Tarry  ye  in  Jerusalem  until  ye  shall  be  endued  with  power  from  on 
high,  thou  didst  say  unto  thy  disciples,  O  Christ;  for  I  will  send  another, 
like  unto  myself,  even  the  Comforter,  my  Spirit  and  the  Father's,  in  whom 
ye  shall  be  established. 

IV.  When  he  foresaw  thy  coming  in  the  latter  days,  O  Christ,  the 
Prophet  exclaimed:  I  have  heard  of  thy  power,  O  Lord,  that  thou  art 
come  to  save  all  thine  anointed. 

V.  The  Spirit  of  salvation,  through  thy  fear,  O  Lord,  conceived  in  the 
womb  of  the  Prophets,  and  born  upon  earth  maketh  pure  the  hearts  of  the 
Apostles,  and  in  that  it  is  righteous,  is  renewed  in  the  faithful.  For  thy 
statutes  are  light  and  peace. 

VI.  Sailing  on  the  stormy  sea  of  earthly  cares,  drowning  in  the  billows 
of  the  sins  which  compass  me  round  about,  and  cast  forth  unto  the  soul- 
destroying  monster,  like  Jonah  I  cry  unto  thee,  O  Christ:  Lead  thou  me 
forth  from  the  death-dealing  abyss. 

VII.  When  they  were  cast  into  the  fiery  furnace,  the  God-fearing 
Children  transmuted  the  fire  into  dew,  crying  aloud,  after  this  manner,  in 
song:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  Fathers. 

VIII.  The  bush  which  could  not  be  consumed,  though  surrounded  by 
fire,  on  Sinai  revealed  God  unto  Moses,  slow  of  tongue  and  halting  of 
speech :  and  the  zeal  toward  God  of  the  Three  Children  showed  the  singers 
untouched  of  the  fire.  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord  bless  ye  the  Lord,  and 
magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages. 


PENTECOST  247 

IX.  O  Maiden  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  in  birth-giving  suffered  not 
defilement,  and  didst  lend  flesh  unto  the  All-creating  Word ;  Mother  Un- 
wedded,  Receptacle  of  Him  who  cannot  be  contained,  Abode  of  thy 
Maker  illimitable,  we  magnify  thee. 

Benediction.  May  he  who  sent  down  the  Most  Holy  Spirit,  in  the  form 
of  fiery  tongues,  upon  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles,  Christ,  our  true  God: 
and  so  forth,  as  usual.     (See  page  122.)

Holy  Spirit  descended  in  tongues  of  fire,  as  Luke,  preaching  the  word  of 
God,  doth  relate;  for  he  saith:  The  disciples  of  Christ  being  assembled  in 
one  place,  there  came  a  sound  as  of  a  rushing  mighty  wind,  and  it  filled  all 
the  house  where  they  were  sitting.  And  they  all  began  to  speak  in  strange 
tongues  with  strange  doctrines,  by  the  strange  commands  of  the  Holy 
Trinity.

Priest  O  Lord  most  pure,  spotless,  who  art  from  everlasting,  invisible, 
ineffable,  unsearchable,  unchanging,  unsurpassable,  immeasurable,  long- 
suffering;  who  alone  hast  immortality;  who  dwellest  in  light  unapproach- 
able, who  hast  made  heaven  and  earth  and  the  sea,  and  all  that  therein  is; 
who  grantest  unto  all  men  their  petitions  before  they  ask:  We  pray  thee, 
and  beseech  thee,  O  Mas'ter  who  lovest  mankind,  the  Father  of  our  Lord, 
and  God,  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ,  who  for  us  men  and  for  our  salvation 
came  down  from  heaven,  and  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Spirit  of  Mary 
the  ever-virgin  and  exceeding-glorious  Birth-giver  of  God ;  who  first  did 
teach  in  words  and  afterwards  did  manifest  himself  in  deeds,  when  he  had 
suffered  his  redeeming  Passion ;  who  hast  given  unto  us,  thy  humble,  and 
sinful,  and  unworthy  servants,  a  command  that  we  should  offer  supplica- 


250  PENTECOST 

tions  unto  thee  with  bending  of  the  neck  and  of  the  knees,  both  for  our 
own  iniquities  and  for  the  ignorances  of  the  people:  Do  thou,  the  same 
all-merciful  God  who  lovest  mankind,  hear  us  in  that  day  when  we  shall 
call  upon  thee,  and  more  especially  upon  this  day  of  Pentecost,  whereon, 
after  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  had  ascended  up  into  heaven,  and  had 
sat  down  at  the  right  hand  of  thee,  who  art  both  his  God  and  his  Father, 
he  did  send  down  the  Holy  Spirit  upon  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles: 
which  also  did  rest  upon  each  one  of  them,  so  that  they  were  all  filled  with 
its  inexhaustible  grace,  and  did  declare  thy  majesty  in  divers  unknown 
tongues,  and  did  prophesy.  Wherefore  hearken  now  to  us  who  pray  unto 
thee,  and  remember  us,  humble  and  condemned  as  we  are,  and  turn 
again  the  captivity  of  our  souls,  exercising  thy  loving-kindness  toward  us 
who  now  offer  up  our  petitions  unto  thee.  Accept  us  who  fall  down  before 
thee,  and  who  cry  aloud  unto  thee,  We  have  sinned !  We  have  cloven  unto 
thee  even  from  our  mother's  womb:  thou  art  our  God.  But  because  we 
have  passed  our  days  in  vanity,  we  have  stripped  ourselves  of  thine  aid, 
we  have  deprived  ourselves  of  every  valid  defence.  But  confidently  trust- 
ing in  thy  bounties,  we  call  unto  thee:  Remember  not  the  sins  of  our 
youth  and  our  ignorances;  and  cleanse  thou  us  from  our  secret  sins;  and 
forsake  us  not  in  the  days  of  our  old  age,  when  our  strength  faileth  us. 
Even  until  we  return  again  into  the  earth,  abandon  us  not,  vouchsafe  us 
grace  to  have  recourse  unto  thee ;  and  receive  us,  because  of  thy  favour  and 
graciousness.  Measure  our  wickedness  according  to  the  measure  of  thy 
bounties.  Set  over  against  the  multitude  of  our  transgressions  the  abyss 
of  thy  compassions.  Look  down  from  thy  holiness  on  high,  O  Lord,  upon 
thy  people  now  present  before  thee,  who  await  thy  rich  mercies.  Visit  us 
with  thy  loving-kindness:  deliver  us  from  the  assaults  of  the  Devil.  Es- 
tablish our  life  in  thy  holy  and  sacred  commandments.  Commit  thy 
people  unto  an  Angel,  a  faithful  guardian.  Gather  us  all  into  thy  king- 
dom. Grant  pardon  unto  those  who  put  their  trust  in  thee.  Put  away 
from  them  and  from  us  all  sins.  Purify  us  by  the  operation  of  thy  Holy 
Spirit;  bring  to  naught  the  machinations  of  the  enemy  against  us. 
And  thereto  is  added  the  following  Prayer: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord,  Master  Almighty,  who  hast  illumined  the 
day  with  the  light  of  the  sun,  and  hast  made  bright  the  night  with  the 
brilliant  flashes  of  the  lightning;  who  hast  graciously  enabled  us  to  pass 
through  the  long  day,  and  to  draw  near  to  the  beginning  of  the  night. 
Hear  our  petitions,  and  the  petitions  of  all  thy  people,  and  granting 
pardon  unto  us  for  all  our  sins,  both  voluntary  and  involuntary,  accept 
our  evening  prayers,  and  send  down  the  multitude  of  thy  mercy  and  thy 
bounties  upon  thine  inheritance.  Guard  us  with  thy  holy  Angels.  Arm 
us  with  the  armour  of  thy  righteousness.  Encompass  us  round  about 
with  the  ramparts  of  thy  truth.  Guard  us  by  thy  might.  Deliver  us 
from  every  assault,  and  from  every  treacherous  plot  of  the  adversary. 


PENTECOST  251 

And  grant  unto  us  that  this  present  evening  and  the  approaching  night, 
and  all  the  days  of  our  life,  may  be  perfect,  holy,  peaceful,  sinless,  with- 
out stumbling,  untroubled  of  dreams;  through  the  prayers  of  the  holy 
Birth-giver  of  God,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  who,  in  all  the  ages,  have  been 
acceptable  in  thy  sight. 

Then  the  Little  Litany. 

Deacon.  Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest  maketh  the  Exclamation: 

For  thine  it  is  to  show  mercy  upon  us  and  to  save  us,  O  Lord  our  God, 
and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to 
the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Priest,  or  the  Deacon,  saith  this  Litany: 

Let  us  all  say,  with  all  our  soul  and  with  all  our  mind  let  us  say: 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Deacon.  O  Almighty  Lord,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  we  beseech  thee: 
hearken,  and  have  mercy 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Here  follow  petitions  for  the  Ruler  of  the  Land  and  for  all  the  Authorities  {accord-

252  PENTECOST 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen.     Amen. 

And  immediately  the  Deacon  saith: 
Again,  yet  again,  on  bended  knees  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir,  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

The  Second  Prayer. 
O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  hast  bestowed  upon  men  thy  peace 
and  the  gift  of  thy  Holy  Spirit;  who,  while  thou  wast  yet  with  us  in  this 
present  life,  didst  give  unto  thy  faithful  people  an  inheritance  which  shall 
not  be  taken  away  from  them  forever ;  who  this  day  didst  send  down  thy 
grace  upon  thy  disciples  and  apostles,  in  manner  most  clear,  and  didst 
furnish  their  lips  with  fiery  tongues;  by  whom  now,  we  also,  together  with 
all  mankind,  having  received,  through  the  hearing  of  our  own  ears  di- 
vine knowledge  in  our  own  tongues,  have  been  illumined  with  the  light 
of  the  Spirit,  and  have  put  away  the  delusion  of  darkness  by  the  distribu- 
tion of  the  material  and  visible  tongues  of  fire,  as  also  by  the  marvellous 
operation  of  the  same,  whereby  we  have  been  inspired  with  faith  toward 
thee,  and  to  glorify  thee,  together  with  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit  in 
one  Godhead  and  might;  and  have  been  enlightened  with  power:  Do  thou, 
who  art  the  Brightness  of  the  Father,  of  his  Essence  and  his  Nature  the 
Express  and  Immutable  Image,  the  Fountain  of  Wisdom  and  of  Grace, 
open  the  lips  of  me,  a  sinner,  and  teach  me  in  what  manner  and  for  what 
needs  I  ought  to  pray;  for  thou  knowest  the  great  multitude  of  my  sins, 
but  thy  loving-kindness  shall  overcome  the  enormity  thereof.  For  lo ! 
1  stand  in  awe  before  thee,  and  have  cast  into  the  great  deep  of  thy  mercy 
the  despair  of  my  soul.  Govern  my  life,  O  thou  who  governest  all 
creation  by  a  word,  with  the  unutterable  might  of  thy  wisdom,  O  tran- 
quil Haven  of  the  storm-tossed;  and  make  known  unto  me  the  way  in 
which  I  should  walk.  Grant  unto  my  understanding  the  spirit  of  thy 
wisdom,  bestowing  upon  my  ignorance  the  spirit  of  thy  understanding. 
Overshadow  my  deeds  with  the  spirit  of  thy  fear,  and  renew  a  right  spirit 
within  me ;  and  by  thy  sovereign  Spirit  make  stable  the  instability  of  my 
thoughts.  That  being  daily  guided  by  thy  good  Spirit  in  that  which  is 
profitable  for  me,  I  may  be  enabled  to  keep  thy  statutes,  and  ever  bear 
in  mind  thy  glorious  Coming-again,  and  those  things  worthy  of  torment 
which  I  have  committed.  And  give  me  not  over  to  be  led  astray  by  the 
corrupt  pleasures  of  this  present  world,  but  strengthen  in  me  the  desire 
to  strive  for  the  treasures  to  come.  For  thou  hast  said,  O  Master:  what- 
soever a  man  shall  ask  in  thy  Name,  that  shall  he  freely  receive  from  thy 
God  and  Father,  who  is  from  everlasting.  Wherefore,  I,  also,  a  sinner,  at 
this  descent  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  do  entreat  thy  goodness,  that  thou  wilt 


PENTECOST  253 

grant  me  whatsoever  things  I  have  asked  which  are  unto  salvation.  Yea, 
O  Lord,  the  bounteous  Giver  of  every  benefit,  and  the  Distributor  of 
blessings, —  for  it  is  thou  who  givest  most  bountifully  unto  those  who  ask 
of  thee, —  thou  art  pitiful  and  gracious,  and  also  wast  made  a  partaker  of 
our  flesh,  yet  without  sin,  and  dost  incline  thine  ear  with  infinite  loving- 
kindness  unto  those  who  bow  the  knee  before  thee;  who,  also,  wast  made 
the  Propitiation  for  our  sins.  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  grant  thy  bounties 
unto  thy  people.  Hearken  unto  us  from  thy  holy  heaven.  Sanctify  us 
by  the  saving  might  of  thy  right  hand.  Cover  us  with  the  shelter  of  thy 
wings;  and  despise  thou  not  the  work  of  thy  hands.  Unto  thee  alone 
have  we  sinned,  but  thee  alone  do  we  serve.  We  know  not  to  adore  a 
strange  god,  neither  have  we  stretched  out  our  hands,  O  Lord,  unto  any 
other  god.  Pardon  our  iniquities,  and  accept  this  our  prayer,  which  we 
make  unto  thee  on  bended  knees.  Extend  unto  us  all  the  hand  of  thine 
aid.  Receive  the  petitions  of  all  men,  as  it  were  incense  well-pleasing, 
acceptable  before  thine  all-blessed  kingdom. 

And  thereto  is  added  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord,  Lord,  who  deliverest  us  from  all  the  arrows  that  fly  by  day, 
deliver  thou  us,  also,  from  all  things  that  infest  the  darkness.  Accept 
our  evening  sacrifice,  even  the  lif  ting-up  of  our  hands.  Grant  that  we  may 
pass  through  the  course  of  the  night  without  sin,  untempted  of  evil  things; 
and  deliver  us  from  every  alarm  and  cowardice  that  cometh  to  us  from  the 
Devil.  Grant  unto  our  souls  contrition,  and  unto  our  minds  anxiety  con- 
cerning that  strict  searching  out  of  the  thoughts  which  shall  come  in  the 
dread  and  just  Day  of  Judgment.  Nail  our  flesh  to  the  fear  of  thee,  and 
mortify  our  earthly  members :  that,  in  the  quietness  of  sleep,  we  may  be 
illuminated  by  the  vision  of  thy  judgments.  Remove  from  us,  also,  every 
unseemly  imagination  and  hurtful  carnal  passion.  Raise  us  up  again  at 
the  hour  of  prayer,  fortified  in  the  faith,  and  advancing  in  thy  command- 
ments. 

And  the  Deacon  saith: 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Priest  maketh  the  Exclamation: 
Through  the  loving-kindness  and  goodness  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son, 


254  PENTECOST 

with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and 
life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then:  Vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  to  keep  us  this  night  without  sin.  .  .  . 
(Page  9.) 

Then  the  Deacon  saith: 

Again,  yet  again,  on  bended  knees  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

And  the  Priest  readeth  the  Third  Prayer. 

O  Fountain,  ever-flowing,  living,  illumining;  Power  creative,  coeternal 
with  the  Father,  O  Christ  our  God,  who  hast  most  excellently  fulfilled  all 
the  plan  for  the  salvation  of  mankind;  who  didst  shatter  the  bonds  in- 
destructible of  Death,  and  the  bolts  of  Hell,  and  didst  trample  under  foot 
a  host  of  evil  spirits;  who  didst  offer  thyself  a  blameless  victim  for  us, 
giving  thine  all-holy  body  for  a  sacrifice  inviolate,  and  unassailed  of  every 
sin,  and  who,  through  that  terrible  and  ineffable  act  of  sacrifice,  didst 
bestow  upon  us  life  eternal;  who  didst  descend  into  Hell,  and  break  the 
everlasting  bars,  and  show  a  way  up  unto  those  who  abode  in  the  lower 
world;  and  having  enticed,  by  divinely  wise  allurements,  the  origin  of 
mischief  and  the  serpent  of  the  abyss,  and  bound  him  with  cords  of  nether- 
most gloom  and  fire  unquenchable  in  Tartarus,  and  confined  him  in 
outer  darkness,  by  thine  infinite  and  fettering  might,  O  Wisdom  greatly 
glorified  of  the  Father,  thou  didst  manifest  thyself  as  a  mighty  helper  of 
the  assailed;  and  didst  enlighten  those  who  sat  in  darkness  and  in  the 
shadow  of  death,  Do  thou,  O  Lord  of  the  everlasting  glory  and  Son  be- 
loved of  the  Father  most  high,  Light  Eternal  of  Light  Eternal,  the  Sun  of 
Righteousness,  hear  us,  who  now  make  our  fervent  supplications  unto 
thee,  and  give  rest  to  the  souls  of  thy  servants  our  fathers  and  brethren, 
and  our  other  kinsmen  after  the  flesh,  and  of  all  who  are  of  the  household 
of  faith,  who  have  fallen  asleep,  and  whom  we  now  call  to  remembrance. 
For  thou  hast  power  over  all  things,  and  in  thy  hand  thou  upholdest  all 
the  ends  of  the  earth.  O  Master  Almighty,  the  God  of  our  fathers  and 
Lord  of  mercy,  Creator  of  the  race  of  mortals  and  immortals,  and  of  every 
nature  of  man ;  of  that  which  is  brought  together  and  is  again  put  asunder; 
of  life  and  of  death;  of  sojourn  in  the  world  that  now  is,  and  of  translation 
to  the  world  which  is  to  come:  thou  metest  out  the  years  of  life,  and 
appointest  the  time  of  death;  thou  bringest  down  to  Hell,  and  again 
raisest  up;  thou  bindest  unto  impotency  and  loosest  unto  power,  ordering 
things  present  according  to  their  necessity,  and  appointing  things  to  come 
as  is  expedient,  quickening  with  the  hope  of  Resurrection  those  who  were 
smitten  with  the  sting  of  death.  For  thou  art,  of  a  truth,  the  Master  of  all 
men,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the  earth,  and  of  those 
who  are  afar  off  upon  the  sea ;  Who,  on  this  last,  and  great,  and  redeeming 
day  of  the  Pentecostal  feast,  didst  reveal  unto  us  the  mystery  of  the  Holy 


PENTECOST  255 

Trinity,  one  in  Essence,  coeternal,  undivided  and  unmingled;  and  didst 
pour  out  the  indwelling  and  descent  of  thy  holy  and  life-giving  Spirit,  in 
the  form  of  tongues  of  fire,  upon  thy  holy  apostles;  and  didst  appoint  the 
same  to  be  the  heralds  of  the  glad  tidings  of  our  holy  faith ;  and  didst  make 
them  confessors  and  teachers  of  the  true  divine  knowledge;  who,  also,  on 
this  all-perfect  and  saving  Feast,  art  graciously  pleased  to  accept  propitia- 
tory prayers  for  those  who  are  imprisoned  in  Hell,  promising  unto  us  who 
are  held  in  bondage  great  hope  of  release  from  the  vileness  that  doth  hinder 
us  and  did  hinder  them;  and  that  thou  wilt  send  down  thy  consolation. 
Hear  us,  thy  humble  ones,  who  make  our  supplications  unto  thee,  and 
give  rest  to  the  souls  of  thy  servants  who  have  fallen  asleep,  in  a  place  of 
light,  a  place  of  verdure,  a  place  of  refreshment  whence  all  sickness,  sorrow 
and  sighing  have  fled  away:  And  establish  thou  their  souls  in  the  mansions 
of  the  Just;  and  graciously  vouchsafe  unto  them  peace  and  pardon;  for 
the  dead  shall  not  praise  thee,  O  Lord,  neither  shall  they  who  are  in  Hell 
make  bold  to  offer  unto  thee  confession.  But  we  who  are  living  will  bless 
thee,  and  will  pray,  and  offer  unto  thee  propitiatory  prayers  and  sacri- 
fices for  their  souls. 

And  thereto  is  added  the  following  Prayer: 
O  God  great  and  eternal,  who  art  holy  and  lovest  mankind;  who  hast 
vouchsafed  unto  us  at  this  present  hour  to  stand  before  thine  ineffable 
glory,  and  to  sing  and  to  praise  thy  wonders:  Purify  us,  thine  un- 
worthy servants,  and  grant  us  grace  that,  with  a  contrite  heart,  and 
without  presumption,  we  may  offer  unto  thee  the  Thrice-Holy  hymn  of 
praise  and  thanksgiving  for  thy  great  gifts,  which  thou  hast  bestowed  and 
always  dost  bestow  upon  us.  Remember,  O  Lord,  our  weakness,  and 
destroy  us  not  in  our  iniquity,  but  show  great  mercy  upon  our  humility; 
that,  fleeing  from  the  darkness  of  sin,  we  may  walk  in  the  daylight  of 
righteousness;  and  that,  putting  on  the  armour  of  light,  we  may  remain 
unassailed  by  any  despiteful  attack  of  the  Evil  One,  and  with  boldness 
may  glorify  in  all  things  thee,  the  only  true  God,  who  also  lovest  mankind. 
For  thine,  O  Lord  and  Creator  of  all  men,  is  that  great  and  veritable 
mystery,  the  dissolution  of  thy  creatures  for  a  season,  and  thereafter  their 
redintegration  and  their  rest  forever.  We  acknowledge  thy  grace  in  all 
things;  for  our  coming  into  this  world  and  our  going  out  of  it;  for  our 
hopes  of  resurrection  and  of  the  life  immortal  faithfully  pledged  unto  us 
through  thine  unfailing  promises,  the  which  we  shall  receive  hereafter  in 
thy  Second  Coming.  For  thou  art  the  Chieftain  of  our  Resurrection,  and 
the  Judge  impartial  and  benignant  of  the  dead,  and  the  Master  and  Lord 
of  recompense,  who  didst  become  a  partaker,  on  equal  terms,  of  our 
flesh  and  blood,  because  of  thine  exceeding  great  condescension;  and 
when,  of  thine  own  will,  that  thou  mightest  place  thyself  under  tempta- 
tion, thou  didst  accept  our  congenital  passions,  because  of  thy  compassion, 


256  PENTECOST 

and  didst  suffer  through  them,  being  thyself  tempted  thereby,  thou  didst 
become  for  us  who  are  tempted  the  helper  which  thou  thyself  hadst  prom- 
ised; and  thereby  hast  thou  led  us  to  thy  passionlessness.  Wherefore, 
O  Master,  receive  thou  our  prayers  and  supplications,  and  give  rest  unto 
the  fathers,  mothers,  children,  brothers,  and  sisters,  blood-relations  and 
kinsfolk  of  each  and  all  of  us,  and  unto  all  souls  which  have  fallen  asleep 
before  us;  and  establish  their  spirits  in  the  hope  of  Resurrection  unto  life 
eternal,  and  inscribe  their  names  in  the  Book  of  Life,  in  the  bosom  of 
Abraham,  and  of  Isaac,  and  of  Jacob,  and  in  the  land  of  the  living,  in  the 
kingdom  of  heaven,  in  the  Paradise  of  sweetness;  by  thy  radiant  Angels 
guiding  all  into  thy  holy  mansions ;  raising  up  with  thee,  also,  our  bodies, 
in  that  day  which  thou  hast  appointed  by  thy  holy  and  faithful  promise. 
Because  there  is  no  death,  O  Lord,  for  thy  servants  when  we  depart  from 
the  body  and  come  unto  thee,  our  God,  but  a  change  from  things  very 
sorrowful  unto  things  most  benignant  and  most  sweet,  and  unto  repose 
and  gladness.  If,  therefore,  we  have  in  aught  transgressed  against  thee, 
be  merciful  unto  us  and  unto  them;  because  there  is  no  one  pure  from 
stain  in  thy  sight,  even  for  a  single  day  of  his  life,  save  thou  alone,  who 
didst  manifest  thyself  sinless  upon  earth,  O  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ; 
through  whom  also  we  all  trust  to  receive  mercy  and  the  remission  of  our 
sins.  Wherefore,  in  that  thou  art  a  gracious  God  and  lovest  mankind,  do 
thou,  both  to  them  and  to  us,  pardon,  remit,  forgive  our  sins,  both  vol- 
untary and  involuntary,  which  we  have  committed  whether  wilfully  or 
through  ignorance;  whether  those  which  are  manifest  or  those  which 
have  escaped  our  notice;  whether  of  deed,  or  of  thought,  or  of  word,  what- 
soever they  may  be,  in  all  our  acts  and  lives.  And  unto  the  departed  also 
grant  thou  release  and  pardon ;  and  bless  us  who  are  here  present,  grant- 
ing unto  us,  and  to  all  thy  people,  a  good  and  peaceful  ending,  and  open- 
ing unto  us  the  tenderness  of  thy  mercy  and  love  toward  mankind  at  thy 
dread  and  terrible  Coming-again ;  and  make  us  worthy  of  thy  kingdom. 

And  thereto  is  added  the  Seventh  Evening  Prayer.     (See  Vespers,  Prayer  G,  page  4.) 

Then  the  Deacon  saith: 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Priest.  For  thou  art  the  repose  of  our  souls  and  bodies,  and  unto  thee 
do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 


PENTECOST  257 

Deacon.  Let  us  complete  our  evening  prayer  unto  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     And  the  rest,  as  usual.     (See  page  10.) 

The  Priest  then  saith,  secretly,  the  customary  Prayer. 
O  Lord  our  God,  who  didst  bow  the  heavens  and  come  down  .  .  .  (See 
page  10.) 

Exclamation. 

For  thou  art  a  gracious  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Lord,  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  according  to  thy 
word.  For  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation,  which  thou  hast  prepared 
before  the  face  of  all  nations;  a  light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  the  glory 
of  thy  people  Israel. 

O  heavenly  King  .  .  O  Holy  God  .  .  O  all-holy  Trinity  .  .  .  Our 
Father     .  .  For  thine  is  the  kingdom  .  .     (See  page  43.) 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr).  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Christ  our  God, 
who  hast  revealed  fishers  most  wise,  sending  down  upon  them  thy  Holy 
Spirit,  and  thereby  catching  the  universe  as  in  a  net.  Glory  to  thee,  O 
thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Then  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Benediction. 
May  he  who  emptied  himself  from  the  bosom  of  God  and  the  Father, 
and  descended  from  heaven  upon  the  earth,  and  took  upon  himself  all  our 
nature,  and  rendered  it  divine;  and  after  that  ascended  again  into  heaven, 
and  sitteth  at  the  right  hand  of  God  and  the  Father;  who  also  sent  down 
upon  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles  the  divine  and  holy  Spirit,  which  is  of 
one  Essence,  equal  in  power,  and  equal  in  glory  with  himself,  and  thereby 
enlightened  them,  and  through  them  the  whole  universe  —  even  Christ 
our  true  God;  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  pure  and  all-undenled 
Mother,  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  preachers  of  God  and 
Spirit-bearing  apostles,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and 
save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 


THE  TRANSFIGURATION  OF  THE  LORD 

(AUGUST  6 —  19  N.S.) 

At  Vespers,  on  the  Eve. 

The  Stanzas  (Stikhiri)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  IV.  Before  thy 
Crucifixion,  O  Christ,  the  Mount  became  like  unto  the  heavens,  and  a 
cloud  was  outspread  like  a  canopy,  while  thou  wast  transfigured,  and 
while  the  Father  bare  witness  unto  thee.  There  was  Peter,  together  with 
James  and  John,  inasmuch  as  they  desired  to  be  with  thee  at  the  time  of 
thy  betrayal  also;  that,  having  beheld  thy  marvels,  they  might  not  be 
affrighted  at  thy  sufferings.  Make  us  also  worthy  to  adore  the  same  in 
peace,  for  the  sake  of  thy  great  mercy. 

Before  thy  Crucifixion,  O  Lord,  having  taken  thy  disciples  into  a  high 
mountain,  thou  wast  transfigured  before  them,  dazzling  them  with  rays  of 
might;  being  desirous  to  show  unto  them  the  radiance  of  the  Resurrec- 
tion; both  because  of  thy  love  toward  mankind  and  for  the  sake  of  thy 
power.  Vouchsafe  the  same  unto  us  in  peace,  O  God,  inasmuch  as  thou 
art  merciful  and  lovest  mankind. 

The  mountain  that  of  old  was  gloomy  and  smoking  is  now  honourable 
and  holy,  for  thereon  thy  feet  have  stood,  O  Lord;  for  the  mystery  which 
was  hidden  from  eternity,  even  thy  dread  Transfiguration,  was  made 
manifest  in  these  last  days  unto  Peter  and  John  and  James,  who,  unable  to 
endure  such  splendour  of  thy  countenance  and  radiance  of  thy  garments, 
fell  with  their  faces  to  the  earth,  and  covered  themselves:  and  overcome 
with  dread,  they  were  amazed  when  they  beheld  Moses  and  Elijah 
talking  with  thee,  touching  those  things  which  should  happen  unto  thee. 
And  a  voice  also  from  the  Father,  bare  witness  unto  thee,  saying:  This  is 
my  beloved  Son,  in  whom  I  am  well  pleased :  hear  ye  him,  who  also  giveth 
unto  the  world  great  mercy. 

When  the  Saviour  was  transfigured  on  the  high  mountain,  having  with 
him  the  chief  disciples,  he  became  most  gloriously  radiant,  showing  that 
inasmuch  as  he  was  radiant  with  the  height  of  virtues,  they  also  would 
be  vouchsafed  divine  glory.  Moses  and  Elijah,  who  talked  with  Christ, 
made  manifest  that  he  ruleth  both  the  quick  and  the  dead,  and  that  he  is 
the  God  who  spake  of  old  through  the  Law  and  the  Prophets.  And  unto 
him  also  did  the  voice  of  the  Father  from  the  cloud  bear  witness,  saying: 
Hear  ye  him,  who  hath  taken  Hell  captive  by  his  Cross,  and  giveth  life 
everlasting  unto  the  dead. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

(By  Anatolius.)     Tone  VI.  Thou  didst  prefigure  thy  Resurrection,  O 


THE  TRANSFIGURATION  OF  THE  LORD  259 

Christ-God,  when  thou  didst  take  three  of  thy  disciples,  Peter  and 
James  and  John,  and  didst  ascend  Mount  Tabor.  And  when  thou  wast 
transfigured,  O  Saviour,  Mount  Tabor  was  covered  with  light,  and  thy 
disciples,  O  Word,  did  throw  themselves  prone  upon  the  earth,  being  un- 
able to  bear  the  sight  of  that  which  may  not  be  looked  upon.  Angels 
ministered  with  fear  and  trembling;  the  heavens  were  affrighted,  and  the 
earth  did  quake,  when  they  beheld  on  earth  the  Lord  of  glory. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  (Paremii).  Exodus  xxiv.  12-18,  xxxiii.  11-23,  xxxiv.  4-6, 
8;  I  Kings  xix.  3-9,  11-13,  15-16. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  II.  Thou  who  didst  illumine  the  whole 
universe  with  thy  light,  wast  transfigured  on  a  high  mountain,  O  Good 
One,  manifesting  unto  thy  disciples  thy  power,  inasmuch  as  thou  deliver- 
est  the  world  from  transgression:  For  which  cause  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee: 
O  merciful  Lord,  save  thou  our  souls. 

The  Hymn  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  VII.  Thou  wast  transfigured  upon  the 
Mount,  O  Christ-God,  revealing  unto  thy  disciples  thy  glory  in  so  far  as 
they  were  able  to  bear  it.  Let  thy  light  everlasting  illumine  us  sinners 
also;  through  the  prayers  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  Light-giver,  glory 
to  thee! 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  VII.  Upon  the  Mount  wast  thou 
transfigured,  and  thy  disciples,  in  so  far  as  they  were  qualified,  beheld 
thy  glory,  O  Christ-God ;  that  when  they  should  see  thee  crucified  they 
might  comprehend  that  thy  suffering  was  voluntary,  and  proclaim  it  unto 
the  world:  For  thou  art,  of  a  truth,  the  effulgence  of  the  Father. 

The  Exaltation.  We  magnify  thee,  O  life-giving  Christ,  and  we  do 
homage  to  the  exceedingly  glorious  Transfiguration  of  thy  Body  most 
pure. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen) ,  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  Tabor  and  Hermon  shall 
rejoice  in  thy  Name. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  Thine  are  the  heavens,  and  the  earth  is  thine.

THE  CANON. 

The  First  Canon.     Tone  IV.     (St.  Cosmas  of  Malum.) 

Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  The  hosts  of  Israel,  when  they  had  passed 
with  foot  unwet  through  the  watery  abyss  of  the  Red  Sea,  and  beheld 
the  warriors  and  the  horsemen  of  the  enemy  drowned  therein,  sang  aloud 
with  joy:  Let  us  sing  praises  unto  our  God,  for  gloriously  hath  he  been 
glorified ! 

III.  The  bow  of  the  mighty  is  become  feeble,  and  those  who  had  no 
strength  have  girded  themselves  with  might.  For  which  cause  my  heart 
is  become  steadfast  in  the  Lord. 

IV    I  have  given  heed  to  thy  glorious  providence,  O  Christ-God,  how 


2бо  THE  TRANSFIGURATION  OF  THE  LORD 

that  thou  wast  born  of  a  Virgin,  to  the  end  that  thou  mightest  deliver 
from  error  all  those  who  cry  unto  thee:  Glory  to  thy  might,  O  Lord. 

V.  O  thou  who  didst  disseminate  the  primeval  radiance  of  the  light, 
that  thy  works  might  sing  thee  in  the  light,  O  Christ  their  Creator:  Guide 
thou  our  paths  in  thy  light. 

VI.  I  cried  unto  the  Lord  in  my  trouble,  and  the  God  of  my  salvation 
heard  me. 

VII.  The  Children  of  Abraham  in  Babylon  of  old  trampled  upon  the 
flame  of  the  furnace,  and  raised  the  song  of  praise:  Blessed  be  thou,  O  God 
of  our  fathers! 

VIII.  The  Children  in  Babylon,  flaming  with  zeal  divine,  valiantly 
trampled  under  foot  the  threat  of  their  tormentor,  and  the  flame;  and 
when  they  were  cast  into  the  midst  of  the  fire,  being  watered  with  dew, 
they  cried :  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord  bless  ye  the  Lord ! 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord :  The  Refrain: 
Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  Lord  who  was  transfigured  on  Tabor. 

IX.  Thy  birth-giving  was  shown  to  be  without  defilement;  God  came 
forth  from  thy  loins,  manifested  himself  as  a  bearer  of  the  flesh  upon 
earth,  and  dwelt  among  men:  Wherefore  we  all  do  magnify  thee,  O 
Birth-giver  of  God. 

The  Benediction.  May  he  who  on  Mount  Tabor  was  transfigured  in 
glory  in  the  presence  of  his  holy  disciples  and  apostles,  Christ,  our  true 
God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  holy  Mother:  and  the  rest,  as  usual.

Bless,  O  Lord,  this  new  fruit  of  the  vine,  which  thou  hast  graciously 
been  pleased  to  permit  to  come  to  maturity,  through  salubrious  seasons, 
and  drops  of  rain,  and  propitious  weather:  and  let  it  be  unto  joy  for  those 
of  us  who  shall  partake  of  this  offspring  of  the  vine;  and  may  we  offer 
it  as  a  gift  to  thee  unto  the  purification  of  our  sins,  through  the  sacred 
and  holy  Body  of  thy  Christ:  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with

262  THE  TRANSFIGURATION  OF  THE  LORD 

This  Prayer  is  said  over  grapes  which  are  brought  into  the  Temple  to  be  blessed  on  the 
sixth  day  of  August,  at  places  where  there  are  vineyards.  But  in  Great  Russia, 
where  there  are  no  vineyards,  apples  are  brought  into  the  Temple  on  that  day,  and 
the  Prayer  for  those  who  bring  the  first-fruits  of  vegetables  is  said. 

Each  vegetable  is  brought  to  the  Temple  in  its  season,  and  the  Prayer  is  said  over  it 
also. 

The  Prayer  for  those  who  bring  the  first-fruits  of  vegetables. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  commanded  that  we  should  bring 
unto  thee  an  offering  of  each  of  thine  own  things,  and  who  requitest  the 
same  with  the  gift  of  thine  eternal  good  things;  who  didst  graciously 
accept  the  offering  of  the  widow,  according  to  her  ability:  Accept  thou 
now  also  these  things  which  are  offered  unto  thee  by  thy  servant,  N.,  and 
vouchsafe  to  place  the  same  among  thine  eternal  treasures ;  granting  unto 
him  (her)  an  abundant  harvest  of  thy  worldly  benefits,  together  with  all 
things  profitable  unto  him  (her). 

For  blessed  is  thy  Name,  and  glorified  is  thy  kingdom,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 


THE  FALLING-ASLEEP  (ASSUMPTION)  OF  THE 
MOST  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER  OF  GOD 

(august  15.) 

(This  Feast  is  preceded  by  a  Fast  of  two  weeks'  duration.) 

At  Vespers. 

The  Stanza  (Stikhira)  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried:  In  Tone  I.  O  marvel 
wonderful !  The  Source  of  life  is  laid  in  the  grave,  and  the  tomb  becometh 
the  ladder  unto  heaven.  Rejoice,  O  Gethsemane,  thou  holy  abode  of  the 
Birth-giver  of  God!  In  that  we  have  Gabriel  for  our  chieftain,  let  us  cry 
aloud,  ye  faithful:  Hail,  thou  that  art  full  of  grace!  The  Lord  is  with 
thee,  through  thee  granting  unto  the  world  great  mercy.     (Twice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

At  the  sovereign  command  of  God  were  the  God-bearing  apostles 
caught  up  on  high  in  the  clouds  from  every  place;  and  when  they  were 
come  to  thine  all-holy  and  life-originating  body,  they  kissed  the  same 
with  love.  The  heavenly  powers  most  high  also,  when  they  were  come 
with  their  Master,  were  seized  with  dread  as  they  escorted  the  body  all- 
pure  and  well-pleasing  unto  God,  which  had  received  God;  with  stately 
mien,  also,  they  went  before,  and  invisibly  cried  aloud  unto  the  Powers 
most  high:  Lo,  the  Queen  over  all,  and  the  Maiden  of  God  cometh.  Be 
ye  lifted  up,  O  gates,  and  lift  ye  up  Her  who  in  more  than  earthly  wise  is 
the  Mother  of  the  Everlasting  Light.  For  through  her  was  salvation  uni- 
versal brought  to  pass  for  men :  and  we  cannot  gaze  upon  her,  and  it  is  not 
possible  to  render  unto  her  the  honour  that  is  meet:  for  her  surpassing 
merit  exceedeth  all  understanding.  Wherefore,  O  Birth-giver  of  God 
most  pure,  who  abidest  ever  with  the  life-bearing  King,  who  also  is  thy 
Son,  entreat  thou  him  that  he  will  ever  preserve  thy  new  people,  and  save 
them  from  every  hostile  assault;  for  we  have  acquired  thine  intercession, 
forever  blessing  thee  who  art  revealed  in  light. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  for  the  Day. 

The  Parables  (Paremii),  the  same  as  for  the  Nativity  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

The  Stanza  at  the  Litiyd,  in  Tone  V  Sing,  O  ye  people,  sing  the  Mother 
of  our  God;  for  to-day  she  doth  yield  up  her  all-radiant  soul  into  the 
hands  most  pure  of  Him  who,  without  seed,  was  incarnate  of  her:  Whom, 
also,  she  doth  unceasingly  entreat  that  he  will  give  unto  the  world  peace 
and  great  mercy. 

The  Hymn  for  the  Day  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  I.  In  Birth-giving  thou  didst 


264    THE  FALLING-ASLEEP  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER 

preserve  thy  virginity;  in  thy  Falling-asleep  thou  hast  not  forsaken  the 
world,  O  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thou  hast  passed  over  into  life,  thou  who 
art  the  Mother  of  Life,  and  through  thine  intercessions  dost  deliver  our 
souls  from  death.     (Konddk.)  Collect-Hymn.     (Page  265.)

THE  CANON. 

The  First  Canon.     Tone  I.     (St.  Cosmas  of  Maium.) 

Theme-Songs  (Irmosi).  I.  Adorned  with  glory  divine  thy  holy  and 
illustrious  memory,  O  Virgin,  hath  gathered  together  all  the  faithful  unto 
joy;  that  after  the  manner  of  Miriam,  with  choirs  and  cymbals,  they  may 
sing  thine  Only-born:  For  gloriously  hath  he  been  glorified. 

III.  O  Christ,  the  Wisdom  and  the  Power  of  God,  who  createth  and 
maintaineth  all  things,  establish  thou  the  Church  steadfast  and  immov- 
able.    For  thou  only  art  holy  who  restest  in  the  Saints. 

IV.  The  predictions  and  dark  sayings  of  the  Prophets  proclaimed 
beforehand  thine  incarnation  of  a  Virgin,  O  Christ:  The  splendour  of  thy 
shining  forth  (said  they)  shall  come  for  the  enlightenment  of  the  nations; 
and  the  deep  with  joy  shall  cry  unto  thee:  Glory  to  thy  might,  O  thou  who 
lovest  mankind. 

V  The  beauty  divine  and  ineffable  of  thy  perfection  will  I  declare,  O 
Christ;  for  thou  who  didst  shine  forth  from  the  Glory  eternal,  as  an  efful- 
gence coeternal  and  one  in  Essence,  when  thou  didst  become  incarnate  of  a 
Virgin's  womb,  didst  shine  as  the  sun  upon  those  who  sat  in  darkness  and 
the  shadow. 

VI .  The  fire  (of  pain)  within  the  whale  of  the  sea,  the  denizen  of  the  deep, 
in  which  the  Prophet  Jonah  was  found,  was  the  prototype  of  thy  three 
days'  burial;  for  remaining  unscathed,  as  before  the  swallowing,  he  cried 
aloud:  With  the  voice  of  praise  will  I  sacrifice  unto  thee,  O  Lord. 

VII.  Love  divine,  resisting  the  wrath  audacious  and  the  fire,  did 
sprinkle  the  fire  with  dew,  but  laughed  to  scorn  the  wrath,  proclaiming 
above  the  instruments  of  music  upon  the  God-inspired,  supersensual  and 
triple-stringed  lyre  of  the  Righteous  Ones  amid  the  flame:  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers,  and  our  God,  exceeding  glorious! 

VIII.  As  dew-dropping  for  the  Godly  Ones,  but  as  consuming  to  the 
impious,  did  the  all-powerful  Angel  of  God  manifest  forth  the  flame  to 
the  Children.  And  the  Birth-giver  of  God  did  he  make  a  life-originating 
Pountain,  pouring  forth  destruction  to  Death  and  life  to  those  who  sing: 


THE  FALLING-ASLEEP  OF  THE  MOST  HOLY  BIRTH-GIVER      265 

The  only  Creator  do  we,  who  have  been  delivered,  praise  in  song  and 
magnify  unto  all  the  ages. 

In  place  of:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord:  The  Refrain:  We,  even  all 
the  nations,  do  bless  thee,  the  only  Birth-giver  of  God.  Or:  When  the 
all-holy  Angels  beheld  thine  Assumption  they  marvelled  how  a  Virgin 
should  ascend  from  earth  into  heaven. 

IX.  The  laws  of  Nature  were  conquered  in  thee,  O  Virgin  pure;  for  in 
birth-giving  was  virginity  preserved,  and  with  death  is  life  conjoined. 
Thou  who,  after  birth-giving,  a  Virgin  didst  remain,  though  dead,  art  yet 
alive,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  savest  always  thine  inheritance. 

At  the  Liturgy. 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk) .  The  tomb  and  death  have  not  been  able  to 
hold  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  is  constant  in  supplications,  in  interces- 
sion an  unfailing  hope:  for  the  Mother  of  the  Life  is  come  into  the  presence 
of  the  Life,  who  took  up  his  abode  in  her  ever- Virgin  womb.

PRAYERS 

ON  THE  FIRST  DAY  AFTER  A  WOMAN  HATH  GIVEN 
BIRTH  TO  A  CHILD 

Priest.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Master,  Lord  Almighty,  who  healest  every  infirmity  and  every  weak- 
ness: Heal  thou  also  this  thy  servant,  N.,  who  this  day  hath  given  birth  to 
a  child,  and  raise  her  up  from  the  bed  whereon  she  lieth.  For,  according 
to  the  words  of  the  Prophet  David,  in  sin  are  we  conceived,  and  we  are 
all  vile  in  thy  sight.  Preserve  her  and  this  child  which  she  hath  borne. 
Cover  her  with  the  shadow  of  thy  wings,  from  the  day  that  now  is  even 
unto  her  last  end;  through  the  prayers  of  the  all-pure  Birth-giver  of  God, 
and  of  all  the  Saints.     For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  wast  born  of  our  all-pure  Lady,  the 
Birth-giver  of  God,  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  and  as  a  babe  didst  lie  in  a 
manger,  and  as  a  little  child  wast  held  in  arms:  Show  mercy  also  upon  this 
thy  servant,  who  to-day  hath  borne  this  child ;  and  forgive  her  sins,  both 
voluntary  and  involuntary ;  and  preserve  her  from  every  oppression  of  the 
Devil ;  and  preserve  the  child  which  hath  been  born  of  her  from  every  spell 
and  perplexity,  from  every  storm  of  adversity,  and  from  evil  spirits, 
whether  of  the  day  or  of  the  night.  Keep  her  under  thy  mighty  hand, 
and  grant  that  she  may  speedily  arise,  and  purify  her  from  uncleanness, 
and  heal  her  sickness;  and  vouchsafe  unto  her  health  and  strength  both  of 
soul  and  body;  and  hedge  her  round  about  with  bright  and  shining  Angels; 
and  preserve  her  from  every  invasion  of  invisible  spirits.  Yea,  Lord,  and 
from  infirmity  and  weakness,  from  jealousy  and  envy,  and  from  the  evil 
eye;  and  have  mercy  upon  her  and  upon  the  child,  according  to  thy  great 
mercy;  and  purify  her  from  bodily  uncleanness,  and  from  the  divers  in- 
ward troubles  which  assail  her.  And  lead  her  forth  by  thy  speedy  mercy, 
in  submissiveness  of  her  body,  unto  recovery.  And  grant  that  the  child 
that  hath  been  born  of  her  may  do  reverence  to  the  earthly  temple  which 
thou  hast  prepared  to  glorify  thy  holy  Name. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and 
to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  wast  graciously  pleased  to  come  down  from 
heaven,  and  to  be  born  of  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin 
Mary,  for  the  salvation  of  us  sinners,  and  who  knowest  the  frailty  of 


AT  THE  NAMING  OF  A  CHILD  267 

man's  nature:  Forgive  thy  servant,  N.,  who  to-day  hath  given  birth, 
according  to  the  multitude  of  thy  bounties.  For  thou  hast  said,  O  Lord': 
Increase,  and  multiply,  and  fill  the  earth,  and  possess  it.  For  which 
cause  also  do  we,  thy  servants,  pray,  and  emboldened  by  thy  long-suffer- 
ing love  towards  mankind,  with  awe  do  cry  aloud  to  the  kingdom  of 
thy  holy  Name :  Look  down  from  heaven  and  behold  the  weakness  of  us 
who  are  condemned;  and  pardon  this  thy  servant,  N.,  and  all  the  house 
wherein  the  child  hath  been  born,  and  those  who  have  touched  her,  and 
all  those  who  are  here  present;  inasmuch  as  thou  art  a  good  God  and 
lovest  mankind ;  for  thou  only  hast  power  to  remit  sins.  Through  the 
prayers  of  the  all-holy  Birth-giver  of  God  and  of  all  the  Saints. 

AT  THE  NAMING  OF  A  CHILD,  WHEN  HE  RECEIVETH  HIS 
NAME,  ON  THE  EIGHTH  DAY  AFTER  HIS  BIRTH 

Priest:  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen.  O  heavenly  King:  and  the  rest  ending:  For  thine  is  the  Kingdom.  .  . 
(See  page  43.)  Then  the  final  Hymn  for  the  Day,  or  for  the  Patron  Saint  of 
the  Church. 

The  Priest  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  upon  the  forehead,  lips  and  breast  of  the  Infant 
and  saith  this  Prayer: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  our  God,  we  pray  unto  thee,  and  we  beseech  thee,  that  the  light 
of  thy  countenance  may  be  shown  upon  this  thy  servant,  N. ;  and  that  the 
cross  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son  may  be  graven  in  his  (her)  heart,  and  in 
his  (her)  thoughts :  that  he  (she)  may  flee  from  the  vanity  of  the  world  and 
from  every  evil  snare  of  the  enemy,  and  may  follow  after  thy  command- 
ments. And  grant,  O  Lord,  that  thy  holy  Name  may  remain  unrejected,' 
by  him  (her) ;  and  that  he  (she)  may  be  united,  in  due  time,  to  thy  holy 
Church ;  and  that  the  dread  Sacraments  of  thy  Christ  may  be  administered 
unto  him  (her) :  That,  having  lived  according  to  thy  commandments,  and 
preserved  without  flaw  the  seal,  he  (she)  may  receive  the  bliss  of  the  elect 
in  thy  kingdom;  through  the  grace  and  love  towards  mankind  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  also  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  Infant  in  his  arms,  he  standeth  before  the  door  of  the  Temple,  or  be- 
fore the  holy  image  of  the  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  maketh  the  sign  of  the 
cross,  saying: 

Hail,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  thou  who  art  full  of  grace!  For  from 
thee  hath  shone  forth  the  Sun  of  Righteousness,  Christ  our  God,  who 
giveth  light  to  them  that  are  in  darkness.  And  rejoice,  thou  aged,  right- 
eous man,  that  didst  receive  in  thine  arms  the  Redeemer  of  our  souls,  who 
giveth  unto  us  resurrection ! 

Then  the  Benediction. 


268  FOR  A  WOMAN  ON  THE  FORTIETH  DAY 

FOR  A  WOMAN  ON  THE  FORTIETH  DAY  AFTER  CHILD 

BIRTH 

The  beginning  is  the  same  as  in  the  preceding  service. 

On  the  fortieth  day  the  Infant  is  brought  to  the  Temple  to  be  churched;  that  is,  to  make 
a  beginning  of  being  taken  into  the  Church.    And  it  is  brought  by  theMother,  who, 
being  already  cleansed  and  washed,  standeth  there  at  the  Entrance,  and  desireth  to 
receive  the  Rite,  after  the  Baptism. 
Bending  down  his  head  to  the  Mother,  as  she  standeth  with  the  Infant,  the  Priest 
maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  over  the  Infant;  and  touching  its  head,  he  saith  the 
Prayer: 
Glory  to  thee,  Our  God  .  .  .  and  ending  with  the  Lord's  Prayer  and  the 
Benediction.    {Page  286.) 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  God  Almighty,  the  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  by 
thy  word  hast  created  all  things,  both  men  endowed  with  speech  and 
dumb  animals,  and  hast  brought  all  things  from  nothingness  into  being, 
we  pray  and  implore  thee:  Thou  hast  saved  this  thy  servant,  N.,  by  thy 
will.  Purify  her,  therefore,  from  all  sin  and  from  every  uncleanness,  as 
she  now  draweth  near  unto  thy  holy  Church;  and  make  her  worthy  to 
partake,  uncondemned,  of  thy  Holy  Mysteries. 

{And  if  the  Child  be  not  living,  the  Prayer  is  read  only  thus  far.   Then  the  Exclama- 
tion. 

For  thou  art  a  good  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

But  if  the  Child  be  alive,  the  following  is  added,  to  the  end:) 

And  bless  thou  the  child  which  hath  been  born  of  her.  Increase  him 
{her) ;  sanctify  him  {her) ;  enlighten  him  {her) ;  render  him  {her)  chaste, 
and'  endow  him  {her)  with  good  understanding.  For  thou  hast  brought 
him  {her)  into  being,  and  hast  shown  him  {her)  the  physical  light,  and 
hast  appointed  him  {her)  to  be  vouchsafed  in  due-  time  spiritual  light, 
and  that  he  {she)  may  be  numbered  among  thy  chosen  flock,  through 
thine  Only-begotten  Son:  with  whom,  also,  thou  art  blessed,  together 
with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Peace  be  unto  all. 

Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

The  Prayer  for  the  Mother  of  the  Child. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  didst  come  for  the  redemption  of  the  human 

race,  come  thou  also  upon  thy  servant,  N.,  and  grant  unto  her,  through 

the  prayers  of  thine  honourable  Priest,  entrance  into  the  temple  of  thy 

glory.     Wash  away  her  bodily  uncleanness,  and  the  stains  of  her  soul, 


FOR  A  WOMAN  ON  THE  FORTIETH  DAY  269 

in  the  fulfilling  of  the  forty  days.     Make  her  worthy  of  the  communion 
of  thy  holy  Body  and  of  thy  Blood. 

For  sanctified  and  glorified  is  thine  all-honourable  and  majestic  Name, 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  Prayer  for  the  Child.     The  Priest,  making  over  the  Child  the  sign  of  the  cross, 
prayeth: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  wast  brought,  on  the  fortieth  day,  as  an  infant 
into  the  Temple  according  to  the  Law,  by  Mary  the  Bride  Unwedded, 
who  also  was  thy  holy  Mother;  and  wast  borne  in  the  arms  of  Simeon 
the  Just:  Do  thou,  O  Master  all-powerful,  bless  also  unto  every  good 
deed  this  infant  which  hath  been  brought  hither,  that  he  (she)  may  pre- 
sent himself  (herself)  unto  thee,  the  Creator  of  all  men,  and  rear  him  (her) 
well-pleasing  unto  thee  in  all  things;  and  drive  far  from  him  (her)  every 
adverse  power,  through  sealing  with  the  sign  of  thy  cross ;  for  thou  art  he 
who  preserveth  infants,  O  Lord.  And  grant  that  having  been  vouchsafed 
holy  Baptism,  he  (she)  may  receive  the  portion  of  the  elect  ones  of  thy 
kingdom,  and  be  preserved,  together  with  us,  through  the  grace  of  the 
holy,  and  consubstantial,  and  undivided  Trinity. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  thanksgiving  and  worship,  together 
with  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good, 
and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

O  God  the  Father  Almighty,  who  by  thy  trumpet-voiced  Prophet 
Isaiah  didst  foretell  unto  us  the  incarnation  through  a  Virgin  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son  and  our  God;  who  in  these  latter  days,  by  thy  good 
pleasure  and  the  cooperation  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  for  the  salvation  of  us 
men,  and  because  of  thy  boundless  compassion,  didst  graciously  deign 
to  become  a  babe  by  her;  and  according  to  the  custom  of  thy  holy  Law 
didst  suffer  thyself  to  be  brought  into  thy  holy  Sanctuary,  after  that  the 
days  of  purification  were  fulfilled,  being  thyself  the  true  law-giver;  and 
didst  condescend  to  be  borne  in  the  arms  of  the  righteous  Simeon,  of 
which  mystery  we  have  recognized  the  prototype,  revealed  by  the  coal  in 
the  tongs,  foretold  by  the  prophet;  which  thing,  also,  we  faithful,  by  grace 
do  imitate:  Do  thou  now  also,  O  Lord,  who  preservest  children,  bless  this 
Infant,  together  with  his  (her)  parents  and  his  (her)  sponsors;  and  grant 
that,  in  due  season,  he  (she)  may  be  united,  through  water  and  the  Spirit 
of  the  new  birth,  unto  thy  holy  flock  of  reason-endowed  sheep,  which  is 
called  by  the  name  of  thy  Christ.  For  thou  art  he  who  dwelleth  on  high, 
and  looketh  down  upon  the  humble  of  heart ;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe 
glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


270  FOR  A  WOMAN  ON  THE  FORTIETH  DAY 

And  if  the  Child  be  already  baptized,  the  Priest  performeth  the  churching.    But  if  not, 
he  doth  this  after  the  Baptism.    And  the  Benediction  to  the  Prayers  is  made  here. 

May  Christ  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  pure  Mother, 
of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles  (and  of  the  Patron  Saint  of 
the  Temple;  and  of  the  Saint  of  the  day) ;  of  the  holy  and  righteous  Ancestors 
of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and 
save  us,  in  that  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

Then  the  Priest  taketh  the  Infant,  and  maketh  with  it  the  sign  of  the  cross  in  front  of 
the  door  of  the  Temple,  saying: 

The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  churched:  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and 
of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then  he  beareth  him  into  the  Temple,  saying: 
He  (she)  entereth  into  thy  house,  to  worship  towards  thy  holy  Temple. 

And  going  to  the  middle  of  the  Temple,  he  saith: 
The  servant  of  God  is  churched :  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then  he  saith: 
In  the  midst  of  the  church  shall  he  (she)  sing  praises  unto  thee. 

Then  he  beareth  him  before  the  door  of  the  Sanctuary,  saying: 
The  servant  of  God  is  churched :  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

And  he  beareth  it  into  the  holy  Sanctuary,  if  it  be  a  male  child;  but  if  it  be  a  female 
child,  to  the  Holy  Door  only,  saying: 

Lord  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  according  to  thy 
word. 

For  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation, 

Which  thou  hast  prepared:  before  the  face  of  all  people; 

To  be  a  light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  to  be  the  glory  of  thy  people 
Israel. 

And  after  this,  at  the  door  of  the  Sanctuary,  he  giveth  the  Child  to  the  Sponsor,  who 
maketh  three  lowly  reverences,  and  taketh  the  Child. 

And  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  customary  Benediction.     (See  above.) 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM* 

THE  PRAYERS  AT  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CATECHUMENS 

The  Priest  looseth  the  girdle  of  the  Person  who  desireth  Illumination,  and  removeth  it, 
and  putteth  it  off  from  him;  and  placeth  him  with  his  face  towards  the  east,  clothed  in 
one  garment  only,  unshod,  and  with  head  uncovered,  and  with  his  arms  hanging  by 
his  sides;  and  he  breatheth  thrice  in  his  face;  and  signeth  his  brow  and  his  breast 
thrice  with  the  sign  of  the  cross;  and  layeth  his  hand  upon  his  head,  saying: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord,  (i) 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

In  thy  Name,  O  Lord  God  of  truth,  and  in  the  Name  of  thine  Only- 
begotten  Son,  and  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  I  lay  my  hand  upon  thy  servant, 
N.,  who  hath  been  found  worthy  to  flee  unto  thy  holy  Name,  and  to 
take  refuge  under  the  shelter  of  thy  wings.  Remove  far  from  him  (her) 
his  (her)  former  delusion,  and  fill  him  (her)  with  the  faith,  hope  and  love 
which  are  in  thee;  that  he  (she)  may  know  that  thou  art  the  only  true 
God,  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  thy  Holy 
Spirit.  Enable  him  (her)  to  walk  in  all  thy  commandments,  and  to  fulfil 
those  things  which  are  well-pleasing  unto  thee;  for  if  a  man  do  those 
things,  he  shall  find  life  in  them.  Inscribe  him  (her)  in  thy  Book  of  Life, 
and  unite  him  (her)  to  the  flock  of  thine  inheritance.  And  may  thy  holy 
Name  be  glorified  in  him  (her),  together  with  that  of  thy  beloved  Son,  our 
Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  of  thy  life-giving  Spirit.  Let  thine  eyes  ever  re- 
gard him  (her)  with  mercy,  and  let  thine  ears  attend  unto  the  voice  of  his 
(her)  supplication.  Make  him  (her)  to  rejoice  in  the  works  of  his  (her) 
hands,  and  in  all  his  (her)  generation ;  that  he  (she)  may  render  praise  unto 
thee,  may  sing,  worship  and  glorify  thy  great  and  exalted  Name  always, 
all  the  days  of  his  (her)  life. 

Exclamation. 
For  all  the  Powers  of  Heaven  sing  praises  unto  thee,  and  thine  is  the 
glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  First  Exorcism. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Lord  layeth  thee  under  ban,  O  Devil:  He  who  came  into  the  world, 
and  made  his  abode  among  men,  that  he  might  overthrow  thy  tyranny 
and  deliver  men;  who  also  upon  the  Tree  did  triumph  over  the  adverse 
powers,  when  the  sun  was  darkened,  and  the  earth  did  quake,  and  the 
graves  were  opened,  and  the  bodies  of  the  Saints  arose;  who  also  by  death

272  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM 

annihilated  Death,  and  overthrew  him  who  exercised  the  dominion  of 
Death,  that  is  thee,  the  Devil.  I  adjure  thee  by  God,  who  hath  revealed 
the  Tree  of  Life,  and  hath  arrayed  in  ranks  the  Cherubim  and  the  flaming 
sword  which  turneth  all  ways  to  guard  it:  Be  thou  under  ban.  For  I  ad- 
jure thee  by  him  who  walketh  upon  the  surface  of  the  sea  as  it  were  dry 
land,  and  layeth  under  his  ban  the  tempests  of  the  winds;  whose  glance 
drieth  up  the  deep,  and  whose  interdict  maketh  the  mountains  to  melt 
away.  The  same  now,  through  us,  doth  lay  thee  under  ban.  Fear,  be- 
gone and  depart  from  this  creature,  and  return  not  again,  neither  hide 
thyself  in  him  (her),  neither  seek  thou  to  meet  him  (her),  nor  to  influence 
him  (her),  either  by  night  or  by  day;  either  in  the  morning,  or  at  noonday: 
but  depart  hence  to  thine  own  Tartarus,  until  the  great  Day  of  Judgment 
which  is  ordained.  Fear  thou  God  who  sitteth  upon  the  Cherubim  and 
looketh  upon  the  deeps;  before  whom  tremble  Angels  and  Archangels, 
Thrones,  Dominions,  Principalities,  Authorities,  Powers,  the  many-eyed 
Cherubim  and  the  six-winged  Seraphim;  before  whom,  likewise,  heaven 
and  earth  do  quake,  the  sea  and  all  that  therein  is.  Begone,  and  depart 
from  this  sealed,  newly-enlisted  warrior  of  Christ  our  God.  For  I  adjure 
thee  by  him  who  rideth  upon  the  wings  of  the  wind,  and  maketh  his  Angels 
spirits,  and  his  ministers  a  flaming  fire:  Begone,  and  depart  from  this 
creature,  with  all  thy  powers  and  thine  angels. 

Exclamation. 
For  glorified  is  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  Second  Exorcism. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

God,  holy,  terrible  and  glorious,  who  is  unsearchable  and  inscrutable 
in  all  his  works  and  might,  hath  foreordained  for  thee  the  penalty  of 
eternal  punishment,  O  Devil:  the  same,  through  us,  his  unworthy  ser- 
vant, doth  command  thee,  with  all  thy  confederate  hosts,  to  depart  hence, 
from  him  (her)  who  hath  been  newly  sealed  in  the  Name  of  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  our  true  God.  Wherefore  I  adjure  thee,  O  most  crafty,  impure, 
vile,  loathsome  and  alien  spirit,  by  the  might  of  Jesus  Christ,  who  hath  all 
power,  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth,  and  who  said  unto  the  deaf  and  dumb 
demon,  Come  out  of  the  man,  and  in  nowise  enter  thou  a  second  time  into 
him:  Depart!  Acknowledge  the  vainness  of  thy  might,  which  hath  not 
power  even  over  swine.  Call  to  mind  him  who,  at  thy  request,  com- 
manded thee  to  enter  into  the  herd  of  swine.  Fear  God,  by  whose  decree 
the  earth  is  established  upon  the  waters;  who  hath  made  the  heavens,  and 
hath  set  the  mountains  with  a  line,  and  the  valleys  with  a  measure;  and 
hath  fixed  bounds  to  the  sands  of  the  sea,  and  a  firm  path  upon  the  stormy 
waters;  who  toucheth  the  mountains  and  they  smoke;  who  clotheth  him- 
self with  light  as  with  a  garment;  who  spreadeth  out  the  heavens  as  it 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  273 

were  a  curtain;  who  covereth  his  exceeding  high  places  with  the  waters; 
who  hath  made  fast  the  earth  upon  its  foundations,  so  that  it  shall  not  be 
removed  unto  ages  of  ages ;  who  collecteth  tbe  water  of  the  sea  and  poureth 
it  out  upon  the  face  of  the  whole  earth :  Begone,  and  depart  from  him  (her) 
who  hath  made  himself  (herself)  ready  for  holy  Illumination.  I  adjure 
thee  by  the  redeeming  Passion  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  by  his 
precious  Body  and  Blood,  and  by  his  terrible  Coming-again ;  for  he  shall 
come,  and  shall  not  tarry,  to  judge  the  whole  earth;  and  he  shall  chastise 
thee  and  thy  confederate  host  with  burning  Gehenna,  committing  thee  to 
outer  darkness,  where  the  worm  ceaseth  not,  and  the  fire  is  not  quenched. 
For  of  Christ  our  God  is  the  dominion,  with  the  Father  and  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

The  Third  Exorcism. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  of  Sabaoth,  the  God  of  Israel,  who  healest  every  malady  and 
every  infirmity:  Look  upon  thy  servant;  prove  him  (her)  and  search  him 
(her),  and  root  out  of  him  (her)  every  operation  of  the  Devil.  Rebuke  the 
unclean  spirits  and  expel  them,  and  purify  the  works  of  thy  hands;  and 
exerting  thy  trenchant  might,  speedily  crush  down  Satan  under  his  (her) 
feet;  and  give  him  (her)  victory  over  the  same,  and  over  his  foul  spirits; 
that,  having  obtained  mercy  from  thee,  he  (she)  may  be  made  worthy  to 
partake  of  thy  heavenly  Mysteries;  and  may  ascribe  unto  thee  glory,  to 
the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

A  Fourth  Prayer. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Thou  who  in  verity  existest,  O  Lord  the  Master;  who  hast  created 
man  in  thine  own  likeness,  and  hast  bestowed  upon  him  the  power  of  life 
eternal;  who  also  despisest  not  those  who  have  fallen  away  through  sin, 
but  hast  provided  salvation  for  the  world  through  the  incarnation  of  thy 
Christ:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  delivering  also  this  thy  creature  from  the 
bondage  of  the  enemy,  receive  him  (her)  into  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 
Open  the  eyes  of  his  (her)  understanding,  that  the  light  of  thy  Gospel  may 
shine  brightly  in  him  (her).  Yoke  unto  his  (her)  life  a  radiant  Angel,  who 
shall  deliver  him  (her)  from  every  snare  of  the  adversary,  from  encounter 
with  evil,  from  the  demon  of  the  noonday,  and  from  evil  visions. 

Then  the  Priest  breatheth  upon  his  mouth,  his  brow,  and  his  breast,  saying: 
Expel  from  him  (her)  every  evil  and  impure  spirit  which  hideth  and 
maketh  its  lair  in  his  (her)  heart.     (And  this  he  saith  thrice.) 

The  spirit  of  error,  the  spirit  of  guile,  the  spirit  of  idolatry  and  of  every 
concupiscence;  the  spirit  of  deceit  and  of  every  uncleanness  which  oper- 
ateth  through  the  prompting  of  the  Devil.  And  make  him  (her)  a  reason- 
endowed  sheep  (2)  in  the  holy  flock  of  thy  Christ,  an  honourable  member 


274  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM 

of  thy  Church,  a  consecrated  vessel,  a  child  of  the  light,  and  an  heir  of  thy 
kingdom ;  that  having  lived  in  accordance  with  thy  commandments,  and 
preserved  inviolate  the  seal,  and  kept  his  {her)  garment  undenled,  he  (she) 
may  receive  the  blessedness  of  the  Saints  in  thy  kingdom. 

In  a  loud  voice. 

Through  the  grace,  and  bounties,  and  love  towards  mankind  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thy  most 
holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Priest  turneth  the  person  who  is  come  to  Baptism  to  face  the  west,  (3)  unclad, 
unshod,  and  having  his  hands  uplifted.     And  he  saith: 

Dost  thou  renounce  Satan,  and  all  his  Angels,  and  all  his  works,  and  all 
his  service,  and  all  his  pride? 

And  the  Catechumen  maketh  answer,  or  his  Sponsor  for  him,  and  saith: 
I  do.     (And  this  question  and  answer  are  thrice  repeated.) 

Again  the  Priest  questioneth  the  Catechumen. 
Hast  thou  renounced  Satan? 

And  the  Catechumen,  or  his  Sponsor  for  him,  maketh  answer: 
I  have.     (And  this  question  and  answer,  likewise,  are  thrice  repeated.) 

Then  saith  the  Priest: 
Breathe  and  spit  upon  him. 

And  when,  he  hath  done  this,  the  Priest  turneth  him  to  the  east,  (4)  with  his  hands 
lowered,  and  saith: 

Dost  thou  unite  thyself  unto  Christ? 

And  the  Catechumen,  or  his  Sponsor  for  him,  maketh  answer: 
I  do.     (And  this  question  and  answer  are  thrice  repeated.) 

Then  the  Priest  saith  to  him: 
Hast  thou  united  thyself  unto  Christ? 

And  he  replieth: 
I  have. 

Dost  thou  believe  in  him? 
I  believe  in  him  as  King  and  as  God» 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  275 

And  he  reciteth  The  Holy  Symbol  of  the  Faith. 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible: 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  only-begotten  Son  of  God.  Begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God, 
Begotten,  not  made;  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom  all 
things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came  down 
from  heaven,  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin  Mary, 
And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius  Pilate, 
and  suffered  and  was  buried,  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again,  according 
to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father.  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both 
the  quick  and  the  dead;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end. 

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord,  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth  from 
the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and 
Apostolic  Church.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission  of  sins. 
I  look  for  the  Resurrection  of  the  dead,  And  the  Life  of  the  world  to  come. 
Amen. 

And  when  he  hath  finished  the  Holy  Symbol  of  the  Faith  the  Priest  inquireth  of  him: 

Hast  thou  united  thyself  unto  Christ? 

I  have.     (This  question  and  answer  are  thrice  repeated.) 

Bow  down  also  before  him. 

And  the  Catechumen  boweth  himself,  saying: 
I  bow  down  before  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  the 
Trinity,  one  in  Essence  and  undivided. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  God,  who  willeth  that  all  men  should  be  saved,  and 
should  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  truth,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages 
of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  he  reciteth  this  Prayer: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  call  thy  servant,  N.,  to  thy  holy  Illumination, 
and  grant  unto  him  (her)  that  great  grace  of  thy  holy  Baptism.  Put  off 
from  him  (her)  the  old  man,  and  renew  him  (her)  unto  life  everlasting; 
and  fill  him  (her)  with  the  power  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  in  the  unity  of  thy 
Christ:  that  he  (she)  may  be  no  more  a  child  of  the  body,  but  a  child  of 
thy  kingdom.  Through  the  good  will  and  grace  of  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thy  most  holy,  and  good, 
and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

The  Priest  entereth  the  Sanctuary  and  putteth  on  white  vestments,  and  his  gauntlets. 
And  when  he  hath  lighted  all  the  tapers,  (5)  he  taketh  the  censer,  and  goeth  to  the

Then  the  Deacon  saith:

And  the  Priest  saith,  aloud: 

Blessed  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy- 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.

And  the  Priest  prayeth,  secretly. 
O  compassionate  and  merci- 
ful God,  who  triest  the  heart 
and  the  reins,  and  who  alone 
knowest  the  secret  thoughts  of 
men  (for  no  deeds  are  hidden 
before  thee,  but  all  things  are 
naked  and  manifest  before 
thine  eyes) ;  Thou  who  knowest 
all  things  concerning  me,  re- 
gard me  not  with  loathing, 
neither  turn  thou  thy  face  from 
me;  but  consider  not  mine  in- 
iquities at  this  present  hour,  O 
thou  who  disregardest  man's 
sins  unto  his  repentance.  And 
wash  away  the  vileness  of  my 
body,  and  the  pollution  of  my 
soul.  And  sanctify  me  wholly 
by  thine  all-perfect,  invisible 
might,  and  by  thy  spiritual  right 
hand;  lest,  while  I  proclaim 
liberty  unto  others,  and  admin- 
ister this  rite  with  perfect 
faith  in  thine  unutterable  love 
toward  mankind,  I  myself  may 
become  the  base  slave  of  sin. 
Yea,  O  Master,  who  alone  art 
good  and  full  of  love  toward 
mankind,  let  not  thy  humble 
servant  be  led  astray;  but 
send  thou  down  upon  me  power 
from  on  high,  and  strengthen 
thou  me  in  the  administration

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

The  Priest  saith  also  the  following  Prayer,  but  aloud : 

Great  art  thou,  O  Lord,  and  marvellous  are  thy  works,  and  there  is 
no  word  which  sufficeth  to  hymn  thy  wonders.     (Thrice.) 

For  thou,  of  thine  own  good  will,  hast  brought  into  being  all  things 
which  before  were  not,  and  by  thy  might  thou  upholdest  creation,  and  by 
thy  providence  thou  orderest  the  world.  When  thou  hadst  joined  to- 
gether the  universe  out  of  four  elements,  thou  didst  crown  the  circle  of  the 
year  with  four  seasons.  Before  thee  tremble  all  the  Powers  endowed 
with  intelligence.  The  sun  singeth  unto  thee.  The  moon  glorifieth  thee. 
The  stars  meet  together  before  thy  presence.  The  light  obeyeth  thee. 
The  deeps  tremble  before  thee.  The  water-springs  are  subject  unto  thee. 
Thou  hast  spread  out  the  heavens  as  it  were  a  curtain.  Thou  hast  estab- 
lished the  earth  upon  the  waters.  Thou  hast  set  round  about  the  sea 
barriers  of  sand.     Thou  hast  shed  abroad  the  air  for  breathing.     The 


278  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM 

Angelic  Powers  serve  thee.  The  Choirs  of  the  Archangels  fall  down  in 
adoration  before  thee.  The  many-eyed  Cherubim  and  the  six-winged 
Seraphim,  as  they  stand  round  about  and  fly,  veil  their  faces  in  awe  before 
thine  ineffable  glory.  For  thou,  who  art  God  inexpressible,  existing  un- 
created before  the  ages,  and  ineffable,  didst  descend  upon  earth,  and 
didst  take  on  the  semblance  of  a  servant,  and  wast  made  in  the  likeness  of 
man:  for,  because  of  the  tender  compassion  of  thy  mercy,  O  Master,  thou 
couldest  not  endure  to  behold  mankind  oppressed  by  the  Devil ;  but  thou 
didst  come,  and  didst  save  us.  We  confess  thy  grace.  We  proclaim  thy 
mercy.  We  conceal  not  thy  gracious  acts.  Thou  hast  delivered  the 
generation  of  our  mortal  nature.  By  thy  birth  thou  didst  sanctify  a  Vir- 
gin's womb.  All  creation  magnifieth  thee,  who  hast  manifested  thyself. 
For  thou,  O  our  God,  hast  revealed  thyself  upon  earth,  and  hast  dwelt 
among  men.  Thou  didst  hallow  the  streams  of  Jordan,  sending  down 
upon  them  from  heaven  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  didst  crush  the  heads  of  the 
dragons  who  lurked  there. 

Wherefore,  O  King  who  lovest  mankind,  come  thou  now  and  sanctify 
this  water,  by  the  indwelling  of  thy  Holy  Spirit.     {Thrice.) 

And  grant  unto  it  the  grace  of  redemption,  the  blessing  of  Jordan. 
Make  it  the  fountain  of  incorruption,  the  gift  of  sanctification,  the  re- 
mission of  sins,  the  remedy  of  infirmities;  the  final  destruction  of  demons, 
unassailable  by  hostile  powers,  filled  with  angelic  might.  Let  those  who 
would  ensnare  thy  creature  flee  far  from  it.  For  we  have  called  upon  thy 
Name,  O  Lord,  and  it  is  wonderful,  and  glorious,  and  terrible  unto  ad- 
versaries. 

Then  he  signet h  the  water  thrice  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  dipping  his  fingers  therein. 
And  breathing  upon  it,  he  saith: 

Let  all  adverse  powers  be  crushed  beneath  the  sign  of  the  image  of  thy 
cross.     {Thrice.) 

We  pray  thee,  O  God,  that  every  aerial  and  obscure  phantom  may 
withdraw  itself  from  us;  and  that  no  demon  of  darkness  may  conceal 
himself  in  this  water ;  and  that  no  evil  spirit  which  instilleth  darkening  of 
intentions  and  rebelliousness  of  thought  may  descend  into  it  with  him 
{her)  who  is  about  to  be  baptized. 

But  do  thou,  O  Master  of  all,  show  this  water  to  be  the  water  of  re- 
demption, the  water  of  sanctification,  the  purification  of  flesh  and  spirit, 
the  loosing  of  bonds,  the  remission  of  sins,  the  illumination  of  the  soul,  the 
laver  of  regeneration,  the  renewal  of  the  Spirit,  the  gift  of  adoption  to 
sonship,  the  garment  of  incorruption,  the  fountain  of  life.  For  thou  hast 
said,  O  Lord :  Wash  ye,  be  ye  clean ;  put  away  evil  things  from  your  souls. 
Thou  hast  bestowed  upon  us  from  on  high  a  new  birth  through  water  and 
the  Spirit.  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  manifest  thyself  in  this  water,  and  grant 
that  he  {she)  who  is  baptized  therein  may  be  transformed ;  that  he  {she) 
may  put  away  from  him  {her)  the  old  man,  which  is  corrupt  through  the 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  279 

lusts  of  the  flesh,  and  that  he  (she)  may  be  clothed  upon  with  the  new- 
man,  and  renewed  after  the  image  of  him  who  created  him  (her) :  that 
being  buried,  after  the  pattern  of  thy  death,  in  baptism,  he  (she)  may,  in 
like  manner,  be  a  partaker  of  thy  Resurrection ;  and  having  preserved  the 
gift  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  increased  the  measure  of  grace  committed  unto 
him  (her),  he  (she)  may  receive  the  prize  of  his  (her)  high  calling,  and  be 
numbered  with  the  first-born  whose  names  are  written  in  heaven,  in  thee, 
our  God  and  Lord,  Jesus  Christ.  For  unto  thee  are  due  glory,  dominion, 
honour  and  worship,  together  with  thy  Father,  who  is  from  everlasting, 
and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

And  he  breatheth  thrice  upon  the  vessel  containing  the  oil,  and  maketh  thrice  over  it  the 
sign  of  the  cross,  as  it  is  held  by  the  Deacon.     And  when  the  Deacon  hath  said: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

The  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

0  Lord  and  Master,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  who  didst  send  unto  them 
that  were  in  the  ark  of  Noah  thy  dove,  bearing  in  its  beak  a  twig  of  olive, 
the  token  of  reconciliation  and  of  salvation  from  the  flood,  the  foreshad- 
owing of  the  mystery  of  grace ;  and  didst  provide  the  fruit  of  the  olive  for 
the  fulfilling  of  thy  Holy  Mysteries;  who  thereby  fillest  them  that  were 
under  the  Law  with  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  perfectest  them  that  are  under 
grace :  Bless  also  this  holy  oil  with  the  power,  and  operation  and  indwelling 
of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  that  it  may  be  an  anointing  unto  incorruption,  an 
armour  of  righteousness,  to  the  renewing  of  soul  and  body,  to  the  averting 
of  every  assault  of  the  devil,  to  deliverance  from  all  evil  of  those  who  shall 
be  anointed  therewith  in  faith,  or  who  are  partakers  thereof;  unto  thy 
glory  and  the  glory  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  of  thine  all-holy,  and 
good,  and  life-giving.  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Then  the  Priest,  singing  Alleluia  (thrice),  with  the  People,  maketh  three  signs  of  the 
cross  in  the  water  with  the  oil.     And  he  saith: 

Blessed  is  God,  who  illumineth  and  sanctifieth  every  man  that  cometh 
into  the  world,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Person  who  is  to  be  baptized  is  presented.  The  Priest  taketh  of  the  oil  with 
two  fingers,  and  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  upon  his  brow,  his  breast,  and  between 
his  shoulders,  saying: 

The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  anointed  with  the  oil  of  gladness;  (5)  in  the 
Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 


28o  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM 

And  he  anointeth  his  breast  and  shoulders.    On  the  breast,  saying: 
Unto  the  healing  of  soul  and  body. 

On  the  ears. 
Unto  the  hearing  of  faith. 

On  the  hands. 
Thy  hands  have  made  me  and  fashioned  me. 

On  the  feet. 
That  he  may  walk  in  the  way  of  thy  commandments. 

And  when  his  whole  body  is  thus  anointed,  the  Priest  baptizeth  him,  holding  him 
upright,  and  looking  toward  the  east,  as  he  saith: 

The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  baptized,  in  the  name  of  the  Father,  Amen. 
And  of  the  Son,  Amen.     And  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  Amen. 

At  each  invocation  he  immerseth  him,  and  raiseth  him  again.    And  after  the  Baptism 
the  Priest  washeth  his  hands,  singing  with  the  People  Psalm  xxxii. 

Blessed  is  he  whose  unrighteousness  is  forgiven,  and  whose  sin  is  cov- 
ered. Blessed  is  the  man  unto  whom  the  Lord  imputeth  no  s'n,  and  in 
whose  spirit  there  is  no  guile.  For  whilst  I  held  my  tongue,  my  bones 
consumed  away  through  my  daily  complaining.  For  thy  hand  is  heavy 
upon  me  day  and  night,  and  my  moisture  is  like  the  drought  in  summer. 
I  will  acknowledge  my  sin  unto  thee;  and  mine  unrighteousness  have  I 
not  hid.  I  said,  I  will  confess  my  sins  unto  the  Lord ;  and  so  thou  forgav- 
est  the  wickedness  of  my  sin.  For  this  shall  every  one  that  is  godly  make 
his  prayer  unto  thee,  in  a  time  when  thou  mayest  be  found;  but  in  the 
great  water-floods  they  shall  not  come  nigh  him.  Thou  art  a  place  to  hide 
me  in ;  thou  shalt  preserve  me  from  trouble ;  thou  shalt  compass  me  about 
with  songs  of  deliverance.  I  will  inform  thee,  and  teach  thee  in  the  way 
wherein  thou  shalt  go;  and  I  will  guide  thee  with  mine  eye.  Be  ye  not 
like  to  horse  and  mule,  which  have  no  understanding;  whose  mouths 
must  be  held  with  bit  and  bridle,  lest  they  fall  upon  thee.  Great  plagues 
remain  for  the  ungodly;  but  whoso  putteth  his  trust  in  the  Lord,  mercy 
embraceth  him  on  every  side.  Be  glad,  O  ye  righteous,  and  rejoice  in  the 
Lord;  and  be  joyful,  all  ye  that  are  true  of  heart. 

Then,  as  he  putteth  his  garment  upon  him,  the  Priest  saith: 
The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  clothed  with  the  robe  of  righteousness;  in  the 
Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then  shall  be  sung  the  following  Hymn  (Tropdr),  in  Tone  VIII. 

Vouchsafe  unto  me  the  robe  of  light,  O  thou  who  clothest  thyself  witii 
light  as  with  a  garment,  Christ  our  God,  plenteous  in  mercy. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  28I 

THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  CHRISMATION 

And  when  he  hath  put  the  garment  on  him  the  Priest  prayeth  thus: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God  Almighty,  Source  of  all  good  things, 
Sun  of  Righteousness,  who  sheddest  forth  upon  them  that  were  in  dark- 
ness the  light  of  salvation,  through  the  manifestation  of  thine  Only-begot- 
ten Son  and  our  God;  and  who  hast  given  unto  us,  unworthy  though  we 
be,  blessed  purification  through  hallowed  water,  and  divine  sanctification 
through  life-giving  Chrismation;  who  now,  also,  hast  been  graciously 
pleased  to  regenerate  thy  servant  that  hath  newly  received  Illumination, 
by  water  and  the  Spirit,  and  grantest  unto  him  (her)  remission  of  sins, 
whether  voluntary  or  involuntary.  Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  compas- 
sionate King  of  kings,  grant  also  unto  him  (her)  the  seal  of  the  gift  of  thy 
holy,  and  almighty,  and  adorable  Spirit,  and  participation  in  the  holy 
Body  and  the  precious  Blood  of  thy  Christ.  Keep  him  (her)  in  thy  sancti- 
fication; confirm  him  (her),  in  the  Orthodox  faith;  deliver  him  (her)  from 
the  Evil  One,  and  from  all  the  machinations  of  the  same.  And  preserve 
his  (her)  soul  in  purity  and  uprightness,  through  the  saving  fear  of  thee; 
that  he  (she)  may  please  thee  in  every  deed  and  word,  and  may  be  a  child 
and  heir  of  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

Exclamation. 
For  thou  art  our  God,  the  God  who  showeth  mercy  and  saveth;  and 
unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the 
Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  after  this  Prayer  he  anointeth  with  the  holy  Chrism  (6)  the  person  who  hath  been 
baptized,  making  the  sign  of  the  cross:  On  the  brow,  and  on  the  eyes,  and  the  nostrils, 
and  the  lips,  and  on  both  ears,  and  the  breast,  and  the  hands,  and  the  feet,  saying, 
each  time: 

The  seal  of  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then  the  Priest,  accompanied  by  the  Sponsors,  bearing  the  Infant,  maketh  the  circuit 
of  the  Font.     (7)  And  all  sing: 

As  many  as  have  been  baptized  into  Christ  have  put  on  Christ.  Alle- 
luia.    (Thrice.)

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Reader.  {Rom.  vi.  3-1 1.)  Brethren:  Know  ye  not  that  so  many  of  us 
as  were  baptized  into  Jesus  Christ,  were  baptized  into  his  death?  There- 
fore we  are  buried  with  him  by  baptism  into  death:  that  like  as  Christ 
was  raised  up  from  the  dead  by  the  glory  of  the  Father,  even  so  we  also 
should  walk  in  newness  of  life.  For  if  we  have  been  planted  together 
in  the  likeness  of  his  death,  we  shall  be  also  in  the  likeness  of  his  resur- 
rection: knowing  this,  that  our  old  man  is  crucified  with  him,  that  the 
body  of  sin  might  be  destroyed,  that  henceforth  we  should  not  serve  sin. 
For  he  that  is  dead  is  freed  from  sin.  Now,  if  we  be  dead  with  Christ,  we 
believe  that  we  shall  also  live  with  him:  knowing  that  Christ,  being  raised 
from  the  dead,  dieth  no  more;  death  hath  no  more  dominion  over  him. 
For  in  that  he  died,  he  died  unto  sin  once:  but  in  that  he  liveth,  he  liveth 
unto  God.  Likewise  reckon  ye  also  yourselves  to  be  dead  indeed  unto 
sin,  but  alive  unto  God  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord. 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee. 

Reader.  And  to  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  let  us  attend!

Priest.  (Matt,  xxviii.  16-20.)  Then  the  eleven  disciples  went  away 
nto  Galilee,  into  a  mountain  where  Jesus  had  appointed  them.  And 
when  they  saw  him,  they  worshipped  him :  but  some  doubted.  And  Jesus 
came,  and  spake  unto  them,  saying,  All  power  is  given  unto  me  in  heaven 
and  in  earth.  Go  ye  therefore  and  teach  all  nations,  baptizing  them  in 
the  name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost;  teaching 
them  to  observe  all  things  whatsoever  I  have  commanded  you :  and  lo,  I 
am  with  you  always,  even  unto  the  end  of  the  world.     Amen. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee.

And  the  Priest  bestoweth  the  Benediction  (usually  omitted). 
May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  all-pure  Mother; 
of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles;  of  Saint  N.  (the  Patron

mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

And  on  the  eighth  day  the  Baptized  Person  is  brought  again  to  the  church  for  Ablution. 
(8)  And  the  Priest  looseth  his  girdle  and  his  garment,  saying  this  Prayer  which 
followeth: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  thou  who,  through  holy  Baptism,  hast  given  unto  thy  servant  remis- 
sion of  sins,  and  hast  bestowed  upon  him  (her)  a  life  of  regeneration :  Do 
thou,  the  same  Lord  and  Master,  ever  graciously  illumine  his  (her)  heart 
with  the  light  of  thy  countenance.  Maintain  the  shield  of  his  (her)  faith 
unassailed  by  the  enemy.  Preserve  pure  and  unpolluted  the  garment  of 
incorruption  wherewith  thou  hast  endued  him  (her),  upholding  inviolate 
in  him  (her),  by  thy  grace,  the  seal  of  the  Spirit,  and  showing  mercy  unto 
him  (her)  and  unto  us,  through  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies. 

For  blessed  and  glorified  is  thine  all-honourable  and  majestic  Name, 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

A  Second  Prayer. 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  through  the  Font  bestowest  heavenly 
Illumination  upon  them  that  are  baptized;  who  hast  regenerated  thy 
newly-baptized  servant  by  water  and  the  Spirit,  and  hast  granted  unto 
him  (her)  remission  of  his  (her)  sins,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary: 


284  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM 

Lay  thine  almighty  hand  upon  him  (her)  and  preserve  him  (her)  by  the 
power  of  thy  goodness.  Maintain  unassailed  the  earnest  of  the  Spirit, 
and  make  him  (her)  worthy  of  life  everlasting,  and  of  thy  favour. 

For  thou  art  our  sanctification,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to 
the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Priest.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Priest.  He  (she)  who  hath  put  on  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  boweth  also 
his  (her)  head  with  us,  unto  thee.  Keep  him  (her)  ever  a  warrior  invinci- 
ble in  every  attack  of  those  who  assail  him  (her)  and  us ;  and  make  us  all 
victors,  even  unto  the  end,  through  thy  crown  incorruptible.  For  thine 
it  is  to  show  mercy  and  to  save  us,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to- 
gether with  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and 
good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Priest  dippeth  the  sponge  in  pure  water,  and  sprinkleth  the  child,  saying: 
Thou  art  justified.     Thou  art  illumined.     Thou  art  sanctified.     Thou 

art  washed :  (9)  in  the  Name  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  by  the  Spirit  of 

our  God. 

And  with  the  sponge  he  washeth  the  face  and  head  of  the  child,  and  his  breast,  and  the 
rest,  saying: 

Thou  art  baptized.  Thou  art  illumined.  Thou  hast  received  anoint- 
ment with  the  holy  Chrism.  Thou  art  sanctified.  Thou  art  washed: 
in  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Prayer  at  the  cutting  of  the  hair.  (10) 
Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.  — —  Choir,  Lord,  have  mercy. 
O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  honoured  man  with  thine  own 
image,  thou  hast  fashioned  him  from  a  speech-endowed  (2)  soul  and  a 
comely  body  (inasmuch  as  the  body  serveth  the  speech-endowed  soul) : 
for  thou  didst  set  the  head  on  high,  and  endow  it  with  the  chief  est  portion 
of  the  senses,  which,  nevertheless,  impede  not  one  another:  and  thou  hast 
covered  the  head  with  hair,  that  it  be  not  injured  with  the  changes  of  the 
weather,  and  hast  fitly  joined  together  all  his  members,  that  with  them  all 
he  may  give  thanks  unto  thee,  the  Great  Artificer.  Thou,  the  same  Mas- 
ter, through  thy  chosen  vessel,  the  Apostle  Paul,  hast  given  us  a  com- 
mandment that  we  should  do  all  things  to  thy  glory:  Bless,  now,  thy 
servant,  N.,  who  is  come  to  make  a  first  offering  shorn  from  the  hair  of  his 
head,  and  likewise  his  Sponsor;  and  grant  that  they  may  all  exercise 
themselves  in  thy  law,  and  do  those  things  which  are  well  pleasing  in  thy 
sight. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  285 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do 
we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest  shall  recite  this  Prayer. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who,  through  the  fulfilling  of  the  baptismal  font,  by 
thy  goodness  dost  sanctify  them  that  believe  on  thee:  Bless  this  child 
here  present,  and  let  thy  blessing  descend  upon  his  {her)  head.  And  as 
thou  didst  bless  David  the  King  by  the  hand  of  thy  Prophet  Samuel, 
bless  also  the  head  of  thy  servant,  N.,  by  the  hand  of  me,  a  sinner,  inspir- 
ing him  {her)  with  thy  Holy  Spirit;  that  as  he  {she)  increaseth  in  stature, 
and  even  unto  hoary  old  age,  he  {she)  may  ascribe  glory  unto  thee,  and 
behold  the  good  things  of  Jerusalem  all  the  days  of  his  {her)  life. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and 
to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  he  sheareth  the  hair  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  saying: 

N.,  the  servant  of  God,  is  shorn:  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy, 
we  beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  the  rest  of  the  Litany,  page  90,  ending  with  the  petition: 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  all  their  Christ-loving  Army. 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  mercy,  life,  peace,  health,  salvation  and  re- 
mission of  sins  of  the  servant  of  God,  N.,  the  Sponsor,  and  for  the  newly- 
illumined  servant  of  God,  N.    Ц 

That  he  {she)  may  be  kept  in  the  faith  of  a  pure  confession,  in  all  godli- 
ness, and  the  fulfilling  of  the  commandments  of  Christ,  all  the  days  of  his 
{her)  life.   Ц 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do 
we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  he  maketh  the  customary  Benediction.     {See  page  283.) 


THE  RITE  OF  CONFESSION 

The  Spiritual  Father  leadeth  the  Person  who  desireth  to  confess  before  the  holy  image 
{ikona)  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ-Not-made-with-Hands.     And  he  saith: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
{Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy      {Thrice.) 

Glory         now,  and  ever, 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Twelve  times.)     Glory  now,  and  ever 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  {Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  li. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according 
to  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me 
throughly  from  my  wickedness;  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I 
acknowledge  my  faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only 
have  I  sinned,  and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justi- 
fied in  thy  saying,  and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold,  I  was  shapen 
in  wickedness;  and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou 
requirest  truth  in  the  inward  parts;  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand 
wisdom  secretly.  Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean: 
thou  shalt  wash  me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow  Thou  shalt  make 
me  hear  of  joy  and  gladness;  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may 
rejoice.  Turn  thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds.  Make 
me  a  clean  heart,  O  God;  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast  me 
not  away  from  thy  presence;  and  take  not  thy  holy  Spirit  from  me.  O 
give  me  the  comfort  of  thy  help  again;  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free 


THE  RITE  OF  CONFESSION  287 

Spirit.  Then  shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked;  and  sinners  shall 
be  converted  unto  thee.  Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou 
that  art  the  God  of  my  health ;  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteous- 
ness. Thou  shalt  open  my  lips,  O  Lord;  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy 
praise.  For  thou  desirest  no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee:  but  thou 
delightest  not  in  burnt-offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled 
spirit:  a  broken  and  contrite  heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be 
favourable  and  gracious  unto  Zion:  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem. 
Then  shalt  thou  be  pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with  the 
burnt-offerings  and  oblations:  then  shall  they  offer  young  bullocks  upon 
thine  altar. 

And  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  VI. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  have  mercy  upon  us.  For  we  sinners 
void  of  all  defence,  do  offer  unto  thee,  as  to  our  Master,  this  supplication: 
Have  mercy  upon  us. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  for  in  thee  have  we  trusted,  and  be  not 
very  wroth  with  us,  neither  call  thou  to  remembrance,  our  iniquities; 
but  look  down  even  now  upon  us,  inasmuch  as  thou  art  of  tender  com- 
passion, and  deliver  us  from  our  enemies;  for  thou  art  our  God,  and  we 
are  thy  people,  we  are  all  the  works  of  thy  hands,  and  we  call  upon  thy 
Name. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Open  unto  us  the  door  of  thy  loving-kindness,  O  blessed  Birth-giver 
of  God.  In  that  we  set  our  hope  on  thee  may  we  not  fail,  but  through 
thee  may  we  be  delivered  from  all  adversities;  for  thou  art  the  salvation 
of  all  Christian  people. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Forty  times.) 

Then  the  Priest  saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  God  our  Saviour,  who  by  thy  Prophet  Nathan  didst  grant  unto  re- 
pentant David  pardon  of  his  transgressions,  and  didst  accept  Manasses' 
prayer  of  penitence:  Do  thou,  with  thy  wonted  love  towards  mankind, 
accept  also  thy  servant,  N.,  who  repenteth  him  (her)  of  the  sins  which 
he  (she)  hath  committed;  overlooking  all  that  he  (she)  hath  done,  par- 
doning his  (her)  offences,  and  passing  by  his  (her)  iniquities.  For  thou 
hast  said,  O  Lord:  With  desire  have  I  desired  not  the  death  of  a  sinner, 
but  rather  that  he  should  turn  from  the  wickedness  which  he  hath  com- 
mitted, and  live;  and  that  even  unto  seventy  times  seven,  sins  ought  to  be 
forgiven.  For  thy  majesty  is  incomparable,  and  thy  mercy  is  illimitable; 
and  if  thou  shouldest  regard  iniquity,  who  should  stand?  For  thou  art 
the  God  of  the  penitent,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 


288  THE  RITE  OF  CONFESSION 

Then  another  Prayer: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  the  living  God,  both  Shepherd  and  Lamb, 
who  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  world;  who  didst  remit  the  loan  unto  the 
two  debtors,  and  didst  vouchsafe  to  the  woman  who  was  a  sinnei  the 
remission  of  her  sins:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  loose,  remit,  forgive  the 
sins,  transgressions  and  iniquities,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary, 
whether  of  wilfulness  or  of  ignorance,  which  have  been  committed  unto 
guilt  and  disobedience  by  these  thy  servants.  And  if  they,  bearing  flesh 
and  dwelling  in  the  world,  in  that  they  are  men,  have  in  any  way  been 
beguiled  of  the  devil ;  if  in  word  or  deed,  whether  wittingly  or  unwittingly, 
they  have  sinned,  either  contemning  the  word  of  a  priest,  or  falling  under 
his  anathema,  or  have  broken  their  oath:  Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  in 
that  thou  art  good  and  cherishest  not  ill-will,  graciously  grant  unto  these 
thy  servants  the  word  of  absolution,  remitting  unto  them  their  anathema 
and  curse,  according  to  thy  great  mercy.  Yea,  O  Lord  and  Master,  who 
lovest  mankind,  hear  thou  us  who  make  our  petitions  unto  thy  goodness 
on  behalf  of  these  thy  servants,  and  disregard  thou  all  their  errors,  inas- 
much as  thou  art  exceedingly  merciful ;  and  loose  them  from  punishment 
eternal.  For  thou  hast  said,  O  Master:  Whatsoever  ye  shall  bind  on 
earth  shall  be  bound  in  heaven,  and  whatsoever  ye  shall  loose  on  earth 
shall  be  loosed  in  heaven. 

For  thou  alone  art  without  sin,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to 
the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then  shall  the  Priest  say  to  the  Penitent: 

Behold,  my  child,  Christ  standeth  here  invisibly,  and  receiveth  thy 
confession:  wherefore,  be  not  ashamed,  neither  be  afraid,  and  conceal 
thou  nothing  from  me:  but  tell  me,  doubting  not,  all  things  which  thou 
hast  done;  and  so  shalt  thou  have  pardon  from  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 
Lo,  his  holy  image  is  before  us:  and  I  am  but  a  witness,  bearing  testimony 
before  him  of  all  things  which  thou  dost  say  to  me.  But  if  thou  shalt 
conceal  anything  from  me,  thou  shalt  have  the  greater  sin.  Take  heed, 
therefore,  lest,  having  come  to  the  physician,  thou  depart  unhealed. 

And  then  shall  he  question  him  diligently,  point  by  point,  and  shall  await  his  reply  to 
every  question.     And  first  of  all  he  shall  inquire  concerning  his  faith: 

Tell  me,  my  child,  dost  thou  believe  that  which  hath  been  transmitted 
and  is  taught  by  the  Catholic,  Apostolic  Church,  which  was  planted  and 
nurtured  in  the  East,  and  hath  spread  from  the  East  throughout  the 
world,  and  which  abideth  even  unto  this  day,  immovable  and  unchange- 
able?    And  dost  thou  doubt  any  of  her  doctrines? 


THE  RITE  OF  CONFESSION  289 

And  if  he  believeth  rightly  and  undoubtingly  he  shall  repeat  The  Symbol  of  the 
Faith  : 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible: 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  only-begotten  Son  of  God,  Begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God, 
Begotten,  not  made;  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom  all 
things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came  down 
from  heaven,  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin  Mary, 
And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius  Pilate, 
and  suffered  and  was  buried.  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again,  according 
to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father.  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both 
the  quick  and  the  dead;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end. 

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord,  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth 
from  the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and 
Apostolic  Church.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission  of  sins. 
I  look  for  the  Resurrection  of  the  dead,  And  the  Life  of  the  world  to  come. 
Amen. 

And  when  he  hath  finished,  the  Priest  shall  interrogate  him  in  detail. 

Note.  The  Priest  doth  not  use  the  questions  of  olden  days,  xvhich  are  still  retained  in 
the  Ritual,  but  interrogateth  the  Penitent  discreetly:  and  at  the  last,  when  he  hath 
questioned  him  concerning  the  seven  deadly  sins,  he  saith  the  following  Exhorta- 
tion: 

In  all  these  points  thou  must  henceforth  be  upon  thy  guard.  For 
thou  hast  received  a  second  Baptism,  according  to  the  Christian  Mys- 
tery. And  thou  must  see  to  it  that,  God  helping,  thou  make  a  good  be- 
ginning. But,  above  all,  thou  must  not  bear  thyself  lightly  towards  these 
things,  lest  thou  become  a  cause  of  scorn  to  men ;  for  these  things  do  not 
befit  a  Christian.  But  may  God,  by  his  grace,  aid  thee  to  live  honourably, 
uprightly  and  devoutly. 

And  when  the  Priest  hath  said  all  these  things  unto  him;  and  when  he  hath  revealed  all 
things  concerning  himself,  concealing  nothing,  the  Priest  shall  say  to  him: 

Bow  thy  head. 

Then  the  Person  who  hath  made  his  Confession  boweth  his  head,  and  the  Confessor 
reciteth  this  Prayer: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  Lord  God  of  the  salvation  of  thy  servants,  gracious,  bountiful  and 
long-suffering,  who  repentest  thee  concerning  our  evil  deeds,  and  desirest 
not  the  death  of  a  sinner,  but  rather  that  he  should  turn  from  his  wicked- 
ness and  live:  Show  thy  mercy  now  upon  thy  servant,  N.,  and  grant  unto 
him  (her)  an  image  of  repentance,  forgiveness  of  sins,  and  deliverance, 


20О  THE  RITE  OF  CONFESSION 

pardoning  his  (her)  every  transgression,  whether  voluntary  or  involun- 
tary Reconcile  and  unite  him  (her)  unto  thy  holy  Church,  through  Jesus 
Christ  our  Lord,  with  whom  also  are  due  unto  thee  dominion  and  majesty, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

After  this  Prayer  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Absolution  over  the  Penitent,  who 
kneeleth  humbly,  saying  as  follows,  in  completion  of  the  Holy  Sacrament  of  Con- 
fession: 

May  our  Lord  and  God  Jesus  Christ,  through  the  grace  and  bounties 
of  his  love  towards  mankind,  forgive  thee,  my  child,  N.,  all  thy  trans- 
gressions. And  I,  his  unworthy  Priest,  through  the  power  given  unto 
me  by  him,  do  forgive  and  absolve  thee  from  all  thy  sins,  in  the  Name  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

And  having  finished  the  Absolution,  the  Priest  maketh  with  his  hand  over  the  Penitent 
the  sign  of  the  cross. 

Then:  Meet  is  it:  page  (107.)     Glory       .  now  and  ever     .  .  And  the 

Benediction. 

May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  holy 
Mother,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us:  for  he  is 
gracious  and  loveth  mankind. 


THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY* 

THE  BETROTHAL  SERVICE 

After  the  Divine  Liturgy,  the  Priest  being  in  the  Temple,  those  who  desire  to  be  joined 
together  take  their  stand  before  the  Holy  Door.  The  two  rings  lie  on  the  right-hand 
side  of  the  Holy  Altar.  The  Priest  maketh,  thrice,  the  sign  of  the  cross  over  the 
heads  of  the  bridal  pair;  and  giveth  them  lighted  tapers,  (i)  And  the  Deacon 
saith: 

Bless,  Master. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

For  the  peace  of  the  whole  world:  and  the  res!,  ending:  That  he  will  aid  them:

For  the  servant  of  God,  N.,  and  for  the  handmaid  of  God,  N., 
who  now  plight  each  other  their  troth,  and  for  their  salvation:   fy 

That  there  may  be  granted  unto  them  children  for  the  continua- 
tion of  their  race,  and  all  their  petitions  which  are  unto  salvation :  fy 

That  he  will  send  down  upon  them  perfect  and  peaceful  love,  and 
succour:   fy 

That  he  will  preserve  them  in  oneness  of  mind,  and  in  steadfast- 
ness of  faith :    fy 

That  he  will  bless  them  with  a  blameless  life:   R 

That  the  Lord  our  God  will  grant  unto  them  an  honourable  mar- 
riage, and  a  bed  undenled:   1$ 

That  he  will  deliver  us  from  all  tribulation,  wrath,  and  neces- 
sity: 1$ 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undenlecl,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord.

292  THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY 

Priest.  0  eternal  God,  who  hast  brought  into  unity  those  who  were  sun- 
dered, and  hast  ordained  for  them  an  indissoluble  bond  of  love;  who 
didst  bless  Isaac  and  Rebecca,  and  didst  make  them  heirs  of  thy  promise: 
Bless  also  these  thy  servants,  N.  and  N.,  guiding  them  unto  every  good 
work.  For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee 
do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Priest.  O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  espoused  the  Church  as  a  pure 
Virgin  from  among  the  Gentiles:  Bless  this  Betrothal,  and  unite  and 
maintain  these  thy  servants  in  peace  and  oneness  of  mind. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  taking  the  rings,  the  Priest  blesseth  the  bridal  pair  therewith,  making  the  sign  of 
the  cross  with  the  ring  of  the  Bride  over  the  Bridegroom,  and  with  that  of  the  Bride- 
groom over  the  Bride,  saying  to  the  Man:  (2) 

The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  betrothed  to  the  handmaid  of  God,  N  :  In 
the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

And  to  the  Woman: 

The  handmaid  of  God,  N.,  is  betrothed  to  the  servant  of  God,  N.:  In 
the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

And  when  he  hath  spoken  thus  to  each  one  thrice,  he  placeth  the  rings  on  their  right 
hands.  Then  the  bridal  pair  exchange  the  rings,  and  the  Priest  saith  the  following 
Prayer: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  didst  accompany  the  servant  of  the  patriarch, 
Abraham  into  Mesopotamia,  when  he  was  sent  to  espouse  a  wife  for  his 
lord  Isaac;  and  who,  by  means  of  the  drawing  of  water,  didst  reveal  unto 
him  that  he  should  betroth  Rebecca:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  bless  also 
the  betrothal  of  these  thy  servants,  N  and  N.,  and  confirm  the  word 
which  they  have  spoken.  Establish  them  in  the  holy  union  which  is  from 
thee.  For  thou,  in  the  beginning,  didst  make  them  male  and  female,  and 
by  thee  is  the  woman  joined  unto  the  man  as  a  helpmeet,  and  for  the 
procreation  of  the  human  race.  Wherefore,  O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast 
sent  forth  thy  truth  upon  thine  inheritance,  and  thy  covenant  unto  thy 
servants  our  fathers,  even  thine  elect,  from  generation  to  generation: 
Look  thou  upon  thy  servant,  N.,  and  upon  thy  handmaid,  N.,  and  estab- 
lish and  make  stable  their  betrothal  in  faith,  and  in  oneness  of  mind,  in 


THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY  293 

truth  and  in  love.  For  thou,  O  Lord,  hast  declared  that  a  pledge  should 
be  given  and  confirmed  in  all  things.  By  a  ring  was  power  given  unto 
Joseph  in  Egypt;  by  a  ring  was  Daniel  glorified  in  the  land  of  Babylon;  by 
a  ring  was  the  uprightness  of  Tamar  revealed;  by  a  ring  did  our  heavenly 
Father  show  forth  his  bounty  upon  his  Son ;  for  he  saith :  Put  a  ring  on  his 
hand,  and  bring  hither  the  fatted  calf,  and  kill  it,  and  eat,  and  make 
merry.  By  thine  own  right  hand„0  Lord,  didst  thou  arm  Moses  in  the 
Red  Sea;  by  the  word  of  thy  truth  were  the  heavens  established,  and  the 
foundations  of  the  earth  were  made  firm ;  and  the  right  hands  of  thy  serv- 
ants shall  be  blessed  also  by  thy  mighty  word,  and  by  thine  upraised  arm. 
Wherefore,  O  Lord,  do  thou  now  bless  this  putting-on  of  rings  with  thy 
heavenly  benediction:  and  let  thine  Angel  go  before  them  all  the  days  of 
their  life. 

For  thou  art  he  who  blesseth  and  sanctifieth  all  things,  and  unto  thee 
do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 


THE  ORDER  OF  MARRIAGE,  OR  OF  CROWNING  (3) 

Priest  and  Choir    Refrain.  Glory  to  thee,  our  God;  glory  to  thee. 

Blessed  are  all  they  that  fear  the  Lord.   Ц 

All  they  who  walk  in  his  paths.    R; 

Thou  shalt  eat  of  the  fruit  of  thy  labours.    Ц 

0  blessed  art  thou,  and  happy  shalt  thou  be.   fy 

Thy  wife  shall  be  as  the  fruitful  vine  upon  the  walls  of  thine  house.    1$ 
Thy  children   like  a   newly-planted   olive-orchard   round   about  thy 

table.   Ц 

Lo,  thus  shall  the  man  be  blessed  that  feareth  the  Lord.    1$ 

The  Lord  in  Zion  shall  so  bless  thee,  that  thou  shalt  see  the  good  things 

of  Jerusalem  all  thy  life  long.    R 

Yea,   that  thou  shalt  see  thy  children's  children,   and  peace  upon 

Israel.    Ц 

Then  the  Priest  shall  make  them  an  exhortation,  telling  them  wherein  the  Sacrament  of 
Marriage  consisteth,  and  how  they  ought  to  live  godly  and  uprightly  in  the  wedded 
state.  And  when  his  exhortation  is  finished,  the  Priest  shall  inquire  of  the  Bride- 
groom, saying: 

Hast  thou,  N.,  a  good,  free  and  unconstrained  will  and  a  firm  intention 
to  take  unto  thyself  to  wife  this  woman,  N.,  whom  thou  seest  here  before 

thee? 

And  the  Bridegroom  maketh  answer: 

1  have,  reverend  Father. 

Priest.  Thou  hast  not  promised  thyself  to  any  other  bride? 
The  Bridegroom.  I  have  not  promised  myself,  reverend  Father. 


294  THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY 

And  straightway  the  Priest,  looking  at  the  Bride,  shall  inquire  of  her,  saying: 
Hast  thou,  N.,  a  good,  free  and  unconstrained  will  and  a  firm  intention 
to  take  unto  thyself  to  husband  this  man,  N.,  whom  thou  seest  here  before 
thee? 

And  the  Bride  makcth  ansiver,  saying: 

I  have,  reverend  Father. 

Priest.  Thou  hast  not  promised  thyself  to  any  other  man? 

The  Bride.  I  have  not  promised  myself,  reverend  Father. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith: 

Bless,  Master. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen.

grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undenled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God.

THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY  295 

Then  the  Priest  reciteth,  aloud,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God  most  pure,  the  Creator  of  every  living  thing,  who  didst  trans- 
form the  rib  of  our  forefather  Adam  into  a  wife,  because  of  thy  love 
towards  mankind,  and  didst  bless  them,  and  say  unto  them:  Increase,  and 
multiply,  and  have  dominion  over  the  earth;  and  didst  make  of  the  twain 
one  flesh:  for  which  cause  a  man  shall  leave  his  father  and  mother  and 
cleave  unto  his  wife,  and  the  two  shall  be  one  flesh :  and  what  God  hath 
joined  together,  that  let  no  man  put  asunder:  Thou  who  didst  bless  thy 
servant  Abraham,  and  opening  the  womb  of  Sarah  didst  make  him  to  be 
the  father  of  many  nations;  who  didst  give  Isaac  to  Rebecca,  and  didst 
bless  her  in  child-bearing;  who  didst  join  Jacob  unto  Rachel,  and  from 
that  union  didst  generate  the  twelve  Patriarchs;  who  didst  unite  Joseph 
and  Asenath,  giving  unto  them  as  the  fruit  of  their  procreation  Ephraim 
and  Manasses;  who  didst  accept  Zacharias  and  Elizabeth,  and  didst  make 
their  offspring  to  be  the  Forerunner;  who,  from  the  Root  of  Jesse  accord- 
ing to  the  flesh,  didst  bud  forth  the  ever- Virgin  One,  and  wast  incarnate  of 
her;  and  wast  born  of  her  for  the  redemption  of  the  human  race;  who, 
through  thine  unutterable  gift  and  manifold  goodness  didst  come  to  Cana 
of  Galilee,  and  didst  bless  the  marriage  there,  that  thou  mightest  make 
manifest  that  it  is  thy  will  that  there  should  be  lawful  marriage  and  the 
begetting  of  children:  Do  thou,  the  same  all-holy  Master,  accept  the 
prayer  of  us  thy  servants.  As  thou  wert  present  there,  so  likewise  be 
thou  present  here,  with  thine  invisible  protection.  Bless  this  marriage, 
and  vouchsafe  unto  these  thy  servants,  N  and  N.,  a  peaceful  life,  length 
of  days,  chastity,  mutual  love  in  the  bond  of  peace,  long-lived  seed,  grati- 
tude from  their  posterity,  a  crown  of  glory  which  fadeth  not  away.  Gra- 
ciously grant  that  they  may  behold  their  children's  children.  Preserve 
their  bed  unassailed,  and  give  them  of  the  dew  of  heaven  from  on  high, 
and  of  the  fatness  of  the  earth.  Fill  their  houses  with  wheat,  and  wine, 
and  oil,  and  with  every  beneficence,  that  they  may  bestow  in  turn  upon 
the  needy;  granting  also  unto  those  who  are  here  present  with  them  all 
those  petitions  which  are  for  their  salvation. 

For  thou  art  the  God  of  mercies,  and  bounties,  and  love  towards  man- 
kind, and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son, 
and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.   Lord,  have  mercy. 

Then  the  Priest  reciteth,  aloud,  the  following  Prayer: 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  our  God,  the  Priest  of  mystical  and  pure 
marriage,  and  the  Ordainer  of  the  law  of  the  marriage  of  the  body,  the 
Preserver  of  immortality,  and  the  Provider  of  good  things;  do  thou,  the 
same  Master,  who  in  the  beginning  didst  make  man  and  set  him  to  be,  as 


296  THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY 

it  were,  a  King  over  thy  creation,  and  didst  say:  It  is  not  good  for  man  to 
be  alone  on  the  earth ;  let  us  make  a  helpmeet  for  him ;  and  taking  one  of 
his  ribs  didst  fashion  Woman,  which  when  Adam  beheld,  he  said:  This  is 
now  bone  of  my  bone,  and  flesh  of  my  flesh;  she  shall  be  called  Woman, 
for  she  was  taken  out  of  man ;  for  this  cause  shall  a  man  leave  father  and 
mother,  and  shall  cleave  unto  his  wife,  and  the  twain  shall  be  one  flesh; 
and  those  whom  God  hath  joined  together  let  no  man  put  asunder:  —  Do 
thou  now  also,  O  Master,  our  Lord  and  our  God,  send  down  thy  heavenly 
grace  upon  these  thy  servants,  N.  and  N.;  and  grant  that  this  thy  hand- 
maid may,  in  all  things,  be  subject  unto  her  husband;  and  that  this  thy 
servant  may  be  the  head  of  his  wife,  that  they  may  live  according  to  thy 
will.  Bless  them-,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Abraham  and 
Sarah:  Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Isaac  and  Re- 
becca: Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Jacob  and  all  the 
patriarchs:  Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Joseph  and 
Asenath:  Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Moses  and 
Sepphora:  Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Joachim  and 
Anna:  Bless  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  bless  Zacharias  and 
Elizabeth:  Preserve  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  preserve  Noah 
in  the  ark:  Preserve  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  preserve  Jonah 
in  the  belly  of  the  whale:  Preserve  them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst 
preserve  the  three  Holy  Children  from  the  fire,  sending  down  upon  them 
dew  from  heaven ;  and  let  that  gladness  come  upon  them  which  the  blessed 
Helena  had  when  she  found  the  precious  Cross.  Remember  them,  O 
Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  remember  Enoch,  Shem,  Elijah:  Remember 
them,  O  Lord  our  God,  as  thou  didst  remember  thy  Forty  Holy  Martyrs, 
sending  down  upon  them  crowns  from  heaven:  Remember  them,  O  Lord 
our  God,  and  the  parents  who  have  nurtured  them;  for  the  prayers  of 
parents  make  firm  the  foundations  of  houses.  Remember,  O  Lord  our 
God,  thy  servants  the  groomsman  and  the  bridesmaid  of  the  bridal  pair, 
who  are  come  together  in  this  joy.  Remember,  O  Lord  our  God,  thy 
servant,  N.,  and  thy  handmaid,  N.,  and  bless  them.  Grant  them  of  the 
fruit  of  their  bodies,  fair  children,  concord  of  soul  and  of  body:  Exalt  them 
like  the  cedars  of  Lebanon,  like  a  luxuriant  vine.  Give  them  seed  in  num- 
ber like  unto  the  full  ears  of  grain;  that,  having  sufficiency  in  all  things, 
they  may  abound  in  every  work  that  is  good  and  acceptable  unto  thee. 
And  let  them  behold  their  children's  children,  like  a  newly-planted  olive- 
orchard,  round  about  their  table;  that,  obtaining  favour  in  thy  sight,  they 
may  shine  like  the  stars  of  heaven,  in  thee,  our  God.  For  unto  thee  are 
due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  who  is  from  everlasting, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  thy  Life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. Choir    Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 


THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY  297 

And  again  the  Priest  prayeth,  aloud,  as  followeth: 

O  holy  God,  who  didst  create  man  out  of  the  dust,  and  didst  fashion 
his  wife  out  of  his  rib,  and  didst  join  her  unto  him  as  a  helpmeet;  for 
it  seemed  good  to  thy  majesty  that  man  should  not  be  alone  upon  earth:. 
Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  stretch  out  now  also  thy  hand  from  thy  holy 
dwelling-place,  and  conjoin  this  thy  servant,  N.,  and  this  thy  handmaid, 
N. ;  for  by  thee  is  the  husband  united  unto  the  wife.  Unite  them  in  one 
mind:  wed  them  into  one  flesh,  granting  unto  them  of  the  fruit  of  the 
body  and  the  procreation  of  fair  children. 

For  thine  is  the  majesty,  and  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power 
and  the  glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. Choir.  Amen. 

And  after  the  Amen,  the  Priest  taketh  the  crowns  (4),  and  c  r  own  eth  first  the  Bride- 
groom, saying: 

The  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  crowned  unto  the  handmaid  of  God,  N.: 
In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Choir.  Amen. 

In  like  manner  he  then  crowneth  the  Bride,  saying: 
The  handmaid  of  God,  N.,  is  crowned  unto  the  servant  of  God,  N.:  In 
the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  he  blesseth  them  thrice,  saying,  thrice: 

O  Lord  our  God,  crown  them  with  glory  and  honour.

Reader.  (Eph.  v.  20-33.)  Brethren:  Give  thanks  always  for  all  things 
unto  God  and  the  Father,  in  the  name  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  sub- 
mitting yourselves  one  to  another  in  the  fear  of  God.  Wives,  submit 
yourselves  unto  your  own  husbands,  as  unto  the  Lord.  For  the  husband 
is  the  head  of  the  wife,  even  as  Christ  is  the  head  of  the  church:  and  he  is 
the  Saviour  of  the  body.  Therefore  as  the  church  is  subject  unto  Christ, 
so  let  the  wives  be  to  their  own  husbands  in  everything.     Husbands,  love 


298  THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY 

your  wives,  even  as  Christ  also  loved  the  church,  and  gave  himself  for  it; 
that  he  might  sanctify  and  cleanse  it  with  the  washing  of  water  by  the 
word,  that  he  might  present  it  to  himself  a  glorious  church,  not  having 
spot  or  wrinkle,  or  any  such  thing;  but  that  it  should  be  holy  and  without 
blemish.  So  ought  men  to  love  their  wives,  as  their  own  bodies.  He  that 
loveth  his  wife  loveth  himself.  For  no  man  ever  yet  hated  his  own  flesh ; 
but  n'ourisheth  and  cherisheth  it,  even  as  the  Lord  the  church:  we  are 
members  of  his  body,  of  his  flesh,  and  of  his  bones.  For  this  cause  shall  a 
man  leave  his  father  and  mother,  and  shall  be  joined  unto  his  wife,  and 
they  two  shall  be  one  flesh.  This  is  a  great  mystery:  but  I  speak  con- 
cerning Christ  and  the  church.  Nevertheless,  let  every  one  of  you  in 
particular  so  love  his  wife  even  as  himself:  and  the  wife  see  that  she 
reverence  her  husband. 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee.

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

{John  ii.  1-12.)  And  the  third  day  there  was  a  marriage  in  Cana  of 
Galilee;  and  the  mother  of  Jesus  was  there.  And  both  Jesus  was  called, 
and  his  disciples,  to  the  marriage.  And  when  they  wanted  wine,  the 
mother  of  Jesus  saith  unto  him,  They  have  no  wine.  Jesus  saith  unto 
her,  Woman,  what  have  I  to  do  with  thee?  mine  hour  is  not  yet  come. 
His  mother  saith  unto  the  servants,  Whatsoever  he  saith  unto  you,  do  it. 
And  there  were  setthere  six  water-pots  of  stone,  after  the  manner  of  the 
purifying  of  the  Jews,  containing  two  or  three  firkins  apiece.  Jesus  saith 
unto  them,  Fill  the  water-pots  with  water.  And  they  filled  them  up  to 
the  brim.  And  he  saith  unto  them,  Draw  out  now,  and  bear  unto  the 
governor  of  the  feast.  And  they  bare  it.  When  the  ruler  of  the  feast  had 
tasted  the  water  that  was  made  wine,  and  knew  not  whence  it  was  (but 
the  servants  which  drew  the  water  knew),  the  governor  of  the  feast  called 
the  bridegroom,  and  saith  unto  him,  Every  man  at  the  beginning  doth  set 
forth  good  wine ;  and  when  men  have  well  drunk,  then  that  which  is  worse : 
but  thou  hast  kept  the  good  wine  until  now.  This  beginning  of  miracles 
did  Jesus  in  Cana  of  Galilee,  and  manifested  forth  his  glory;  and  his 
disciples  believed  on  him. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee.

O  Lord  our  God,  who  in  thy  saving  providence  didst  vouchsafe  by 
thy  presence  in  Cana  of  Galilee  to  declare  marriage  honourable:  Do  thou, 
the  same  Lord,  now  also  maintain  in  peace  and  concord  thy  servants,  N

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Priest.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Common  Cup  (5)  is  brought,  and  the  Priest  blesseth  it,  and  reciteth  this 
Prayer: 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  God,  who  hast  created  all  things  by  thy  might,  and  hast  made 
fast  the  round  world,  and  adornest  the  crown  of  all  things  which  thou 
hast  made:  Bless  now,  with  thy  spiritual  blessing,  this  common  cup, 
which  thou  dost  give  to  those  who  are  now  united  for  a  community  of 
marriage. 

Aloud:  For  blessed  is  thy  Name,  and  glorified  is  thy  kingdom,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  Cup  in  his  hand,  the  Priest  giveth  it  thrice  to  them:  first  to  the  Man, 
and  then  to  the  Woman.  Then  immediately  the  Priest  taketh  them,  the  groomsmen 
behind  them  holding  their  crowns,  and  leadelh  them  in  a  circle  (6)  round  about  the 
lectern.     And  the  Priest,  or  the  People,  sing  the  following  Hymn,  in  Tone  V.: 

Rejoice,  O  Isaiah!  A  Virgin  is  with  child,  and  shall  bear  a  Son,  Em- 
manuel, both  God  and  man:  and  Orient  is  his  name;  whom  magnifying  we 
call  the  Virgin  blessed. 

Another,  in  Tone  VII. 

O  Holy  Martyrs,  who  fought  the  good  fight  and  have  received  your 
crowns:  Entreat  ye  the  Lord  that  he  will  have  mercy  on  our  souls.  Glory 
to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  the  Apostles'  boast,  the  Martyrs'  joy,  whose 
preaching  was  the  consubstantial  Trinity. 

Then,  taking  the  crown  of  the  Bridegroom,  he  saith: 
Be  thou  exalted,  O  Bridegroom,  like  unto  Abraham;  and  be  thou 
blessed,  like  unto  Isaac;  and  do  thou  multiply  like  unto  Jacob,  walking 
in  peace,  and  keeping  the  commandments  of  God  in  righteousness.

Then,  taking  the  crown  of  the  Bride,  he  saith: 
And  thou,  O  Bride:  Be  thou  exalted  like  unto  Sarah;  and  exult  thou, 
like  unto  Rebecca;  and  do  thou  multiply,  like  unto  Rachel:  and  rejoice 
thou  in  thy  husband,  fulfilling  the  conditions  of  the  law:  for  so  is  it  well- 
pleasing  unto  God. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy 

The  Priest  prayeth: 

O  God,  our  God,  who  didst  come  to  Cana  of  Galilee,  and  didst  bless 
there  the  marriage  feast:  Bless,  also,  these  thy  servants,  who  through 
thy  good  providence  are  now  united  together  in  wedlock.  Bless  their 
goings  out  and  their  comings  in:  replenish  their  life  with  good  things: 
receive  their  crowns  into  thy  kingdom,  preserving  them  spotless,  blame- 
less, and  without  reproach,  unto  ages  of  ages.

substantial  and  life-giving  Trinity,  one  Godhead,  and  one  Kingdom,  bless 
you;  and  grant  unto  you  length  of  days,  fair  children,  prosperity  of  life, 
and  faith:  and  fill  you  with  abundance  of  all  earthly  good  things,  and 
make  you  worthy  to  obtain  the  blessings  of  the  promise:  through  the 
prayers  of  the  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  of  all  the  Saints.     Amen. 

And  the  Deacon  saith: 

Wisdom ! 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  .  .  .  (See  page  302.) 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  Christ-God,  our  hope,  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  .  .     now,    and    ever  Lord,    have    mercy.       (Thrice.) 

Bless. 

Then  the  Priest  bestoweth  the  final  Benediction. 

May  he  who  by  his  presence  at  the  marriage  feast  in  Cana  of  Galilee 
did  declare  marriage  to  be  an  honourable  estate,  Christ  our  true  God; 
through  the  prayers  of  his  all-holy  Mother;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all- 
laudable  Apostles;  of  the  holy,  God-crowned  Kings  and  Saints-equal- 
to-the-Apostles  Constantine  and  Helena:  of  the  holy  Great  Martyr, 
Procopius;  (7)  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  you  and  save  you: 
forasmuch  as  he  is  good,  and  loveth  mankind. 

Then  the  Priest  maketh  an  exhortation  to  the  newly-married  pair. 
And  the  People  come  and  congratulate  them;  and  they  kiss  each  other.

O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  blessed  the  crown  of  the  year,  and  per- 
mittest  these  crowns  to  be  laid  upon  those  who  are  united  to  one  another 
by  the  law  of  marriage,  and  thus  grantest  unto  them,  as  it  were  a  reward 
of  chastity;  for  they  are  pure  who  are  united  in  the  marriage  which  thou 
hast  made  lawful :  Do  thou  bless  also  in  the  removal  of  these  crowns  those 
who  have  been  united  to  one  another,  and  preserve  their  union  indissolu- 
ble; that  they  may  evermore  give  thanks  unto  thine  all-holy  Name,  of  the

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.   Lord,  have  mercy 

Priest.  O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  showest  pity  upon  all  men,  and 
whose  providence  is  over  all  thy  works;  who  knowest  the  secrets  of  man, 
and  understandest  all  men:  Purge  away  our  sins,  and  forgive  the  trans- 
gressions of  thy  servants,  calling  them  to  repentance,  granting  them  re- 
mission of  their  iniquities,  purification  from  their  sins,  and  pardon  of  their 
errors,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary  O  thou  who  knowest  the 
frailty  of  man's  nature,  in  that  thou  art  his  Maker  and  Creator;  who  didst 
pardon  Rahab  the  harlot,  and  accept  the  contrition  of  the  Publican:  re- 
member not  the  sins  of  our  ignorance  from  our  youth  up.  For  if  thou 
wilt  consider  iniquity,  O  Lord,  Lord,  who  shall  stand  before  thee?  Or 
what  flesh  shall  be  justified  in  thy  sight?  For  thou  only  art  righteous, 
sinless,  holy,  plenteous  in  mercy,  of  great  compassion,  and  repentest  thee 
of  the  evils  of  men.  Do  thou,  O  Master,  who  hast  brought  together  in 
wedlock  thy  servants,  N  and  N.,  unite  them  to  one  another  in  love:  vouch- 
safe unto  them  the  contrition  of  the  Publican,  the  tears  of  the  Harlot,  the 
confession  of  the  Thief;  that,  repenting  with  their  whole  heart,  and  doing 
thy  commandments  in  peace  and  oneness  of  mind,  they  may  be  deemed 
worthy  also  of  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

For  thou  art  he  who  ordereth  all  things,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe 
glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Priest.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord.

The  Priest  saith  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  Word  of  God,  who  wast  lifted  up  on  the 
precious  and  life-giving  cross,  and  didst  thereby  destroy  the  handwriting 
against  us,  and  deliver  us  from  the  dominion  of  the  Devil:  Cleanse  thou 
the  iniquities  of  thy  servants;  because  they,  being  unable  to  bear  the  heat 
and  burden  of  the  day  and  the  hot  desires  of  the  flesh,  are  now  entering 
into  the  bond  of  a  second  marriage,  as  thou  didst  render  lawful  by  thv 
chosen  vessel,  the  Apostle  Paul,  saying,  for  the  sake  of  us  humble  sinners, 
It  is  better  to  marry  in  the  Lord  than  to  burn.  Wherefore,  inasmuch  as 
thou  art  good  and  lovest  mankind,  do  thou  show  mercy  and  forgive. 
Cleanse,  put  away,  pardon  our  transgressions;  for  thou  art  he  who  didst 
take  our  infirmities  on  thy  shoulders;  for  there  is  none  sinless,  or  without 
uncleanness  for  so  much  as  a  single  day  of  his  life,  save  only  Thou,  who 
without  sin  didst  endure  the  flesh,  and  bestowest  on  us  passionlessness 
eternal. 

For  thou  art  God,  the  God  of  the  contrite  in  heart,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

People.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.

He  who  is  to  be  made  a  Taper-bearer  is  led  by  the  Sub-Deacon  into  the  centre  of  the 
Church,  before  the  beginning  of  the  Divine  Liturgy  {see  pagejg),  and  there  makcth 
three  reverences:  and  turning,  he  saluteih  the  Bishop,  thrice.  Then,  drawing  near 
to  the  Bishop,  he  boweth  his  head;  and  the  Bishop  signeth  him,  in  crosswise  form, 
on  the  head  with  his  hand.  Then,  laying  his  hand  upon  the  candidate's  head,  the 
Bishop  saiih  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord,  who  enlightenest  all  created  beings  with  the  light  of  thy 
marvels,  and  knowest  the  intent  of  every  man  before  it  is  formed,  and 
strengthenest  those  who  are  desirous  of  serving  thee:  Do  thou,  the  same 
Lord,  array  in  thy  fair  and  spotless  vesture  this  thy  servant  who  desireth 
to  become  a  Taper-bearer  {these  thy  servants  who  desire  to  become  Taper- 
bearers)  before  thy  Holy  Mysteries;  that  he  {they)  may  be  illumined;  and 
that  attaining  unto  the  world  to  come  he  {they)  may  receive  the  incorrup- 
tible crown  of  life,  and  rejoice  with  thine  elect  in  bliss  everlasting. 

For  hallowed  is  thy  Name,  and  glorified  is  thy  kingdom,  of  the  Father,

Then  shall  be  sung: 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places

Then  the  Hymn  {Tropdr)  for  the  Day  shall  be  read. 
But  if  there  be  a  Liturgy,  then  O  Heavenly  King,  and  O  Holy  God,  and  Our  Father 
shall  be  omitted,  and  only  the  following  Hymns  shall  be  read: 

O  holy  Apostles,  entreat  the  merciful  God  that  he  will  grant  our  souls 
remission  of  their  sins. 

The  grace  of  thy  lips,  shining  forth  like  a  beacon-fire,  hath  illumined 
the  universe,  and  hath  bestowed  upon  the  world  the  treasure  of  non-avari- 
ciousness,  and  hath  shown  us  the  height  of  humility  But  as  thou  in- 
structest  us  with  thy  words,  O  Father  John  Chrysostum,  so  also  intercede 
thou  with  Christ-God,  the  Word,  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Thy  voice  is  gone  out  into  all  the  world,  in  that  it  hath  received  thy 
word,  wherewith  thou  hast  taught  in  manner  well-pleasing  unto  God, 
hast  expounded  the  nature  of  existing  things,  and  hast  adorned  the 
customs  of  mankind.  O  Royal  Priesthood,  Sainted  Father,  pray  thou 
unto  Christ  our  God,  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

The  shepherd's  reed  of  thy  divine  theology  hath  confounded  the 
trumpets  of  the  rhetoricians,  the  same  being  bestowed  upon. thee  as  upon 
one  who  hath  searched  out  the  deep  things  of  the  spirit,  and  grace  of  pro- 
clamation. Wherefore,  O  Father  Gregory,  entreat  thou  Christ-God  that 
our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Glory     .     now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Through  the  prayers  of  all  the  Saints,  and  of  the  Birth -giver  of  God, 
O  Lord,  grant  us  thy  peace,  and  have  mercy  upon  us:  for  thou  only  art 
bountiful. 

Then  the  Bishop  sheareth  the  candidate's  head  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  saying: 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon,  and  the  Reader,  or  a  Chanter,  shall  say: 

Amen. 

Bishop.  And  of  the  Son. 

Proto-Deacon.  Amen. 

Bishop.  And  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Proto-Deacon.  Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  putteth  upon  him  the  short  chasuble,  and  again  maketh,  thrice,  with 
his  hand,  the  sign  of  the  cross  upon  his  head,  and  reciteth  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  God  Almighty,  elect  this  thy  servant  {these  thy  servants),  and 
sanctify  him  {them);  and  enable  him  {them),  with  all  wisdom  and  under- 
standing, to  exercise  the  study  and  reading  of  thy  divine  words,  preserv- 
ing him  {them)  in  blamelessness  of  life. 


308       OFFICE  OF  SETTING  APART  READERS  AND  CHANTERS 

Through  the  mercies  and  bounties  and  love  towards  mankind  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  also  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  the  Bishop  openeth  the  book  of  the  Epistles  upon  the  head  of  the 
Reader.  And  the  Sub-Deacons  lead  him  from  the  Bishop,  and  place  him  in  the 
middle  of  the  Church,  with  his  face  to  the  east;  and  the  book  of  the  Epistles  is  given 
to  him,  and  he  readeth,  a  little,  wheresoever  it  may  chance  to  befall,  and  turning,  he 
boweth  to  the  Bishop  thrice,  according  to  the  rubric,  and  the  Sub-Deacons  divest  him 
of  the  short  chasuble.  Then  the  tunic  is  brought  to  the  Bishop,  and  he  signeth  it 
with  his  hand,  over  the  cross.  And  he  who  hath  been  set  apart  (or  ordained),  having 
signed  himself  with  the  cross,  kisseth  the  cross  upon  the  tunic,  and  the  hand  of  the 
Bishop:  And  the  Sub-Deacons  vest  him  in  the  tunic;  and  the  Bishop  exhorteth  him 
thus: 

My  son(s),  the  first  degree  in  the  Priesthood  is  that  of  Reader.  It  be- 
hooveth  thee  (you)  therefore,  to  peruse  the  divine  Scriptures  daily,  to  the 
end  that  the  hearers,  regarding  thee  (you)  may  receive  edification;  that 
thou  (ye)  in  nowise  shaming  thine  (your)  election,  mayest  prepare  thyself 
(may  prepare  yourselves)  for  a  higher  degree.  For  by  a  chaste,  holy  and 
upright  life  thou  shalt  (ye  shall)  gain  the  favour  of  the  God  of  loving-kind- 
ness, and  shalt  render  thyself  (shall  render  yourselves)  worthy  of  a  greater 
ministry,  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord ;  to  whom  be  glory  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Then  shall  the  Bishop  say: 

Blessed  is  the  Lord.  Lo,  the  servant(s)  of  God,  N.  (NN.),  is  (are) 
become  a  Reader  (Readers)  of  the  most  holy  Church  of  N.:  In  the  Name 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Then  the  Bishop  giveth  him  (or  them)  a  shrine-lamp,  and  he  standeth  (they  stand) 
before  the  Bishop  with  the  lamp,  in  the  appointed  place. 


THE  MANNER  OF  ORDAINING  SUB-DEACONS* 

//  the  Candidate  is  to  receive  the  Laying-on  of  Hands  to  the  Sub-Diaconate  (see  page 
79)  on  the  same  day,  after  he  hath  been  invested  with  the  tunic,  the  Sub-Deacons 
bring  the  dalmatic  and  the  dalmatic-girdle  (that  is  the  stole)  to  the  Bishop.  And 
when  the  Bishop  hath  signed  the  girdle  with  the  cross,  and  he  who  is  to  receive 
Ordination  hath  kissed  it,  and  the  hand  of  the  Bishop,  they  gird  him  therewith. 
And  the  Bishop  signeth  him  with  his  hand,  in  the  form  of  a  cross;  after  which  the 
Archpriest  saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop  laying  his  hand  on  the  Candidate's  head,  reciteth  the  following 
Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who,  through  one  and  the  same  Holy  Spirit  distrib- 
uting gifts  of  grace  to  each  one  of  those  whom  thou  hast  chosen,  hast 
given  to  thy  Church  divers  Orders;  who,  through  thine  inscrutable  prov- 
idence hast  appointed  degrees  of  ministry  therein,  for  the  service  of  thy 
holy,  spotless  Mysteries;  and  who,  through  thine  ineffable  foreknowledge, 
hast  ordained  this  thy  servant  to  be  worthy  to  serve  in  thy  Holy  Church : 
Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  preserve  him  uncondemned  in  all  things.  And 
grant  that  he  may  love  the  beauty  of  thy  house,  stand  before  the  doors  of 
thy  holy  Temple,  and  kindle  the  lamps  in  the  tabernacle  of  thy  glory. 
And  plant  him  in  thy  holy  Church  like  a  fruitful  olive-tree,  which  bringeth 
forth  the  fruits  of  righteousness.  And  make  him  thy  perfect  servant  in 
the  time  of  thine  advent,  that  he  may  receive  the  recompense  of  those  who 
are  well-pleasing  in  thy  sight.  For  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power 
and  the  glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  the  Sub-Deacons  give  the  ewer  and  basin  to  him  who  is  to 
receive  the  Laying-on  of  Hands,  and  lay  a  towel  on  his  shoulders.  And  the  Bishop 
washeth  his  hands.  And  he  who  is  to  be  ordained  Sub-Deacon  poureth  water  over 
the  hands  of  the  Bishop.  Then  he  and  the  Sub-Deacons  kiss  the  hand  of  the  Bishop 
and  depart  to  their  appointed  place.  And  he  who  is  to  be  ordained  Sub-Deacon 
standeth,  holding  the  ewer  and  basin,  with  the  towel,  until  the  Cherubimic  Hymn. 
And  he  saith,  secretly: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  (Thrice).      Glory  .  .  .  now,  and 

ever,        .  O    all-holy    Trinity,  Lord,    have    mercy.       (Thrice.) 

Our  Father,   who   art   in   heaven,  For   thine   is   the   kingdom, 

•  •     Lord,  have  mercy-     (Thrice.)     I  believe  in  one  God, 

Pardon,    remit,    forgive,  O    God,    our    transgressions,    both    vol-

untary  and  involuntary,  whether  of  word  or  of  deed,  whether  of  knowl- 
edge or  of  ignorance,  whether  of  the  day  or  of  the  night,  whether  of 
the  mind  or  of  the  intentions:  forgive  us  all,  forasmuch  as  thou  art 
good  and  lovest  mankind. 

And  if  he  desireth  to  say  anything  further,  he  doth  so  secretly. 

At  the  time  of  the  Cherubimic  Hymn,  he  is  led  in  front  of  the  Holy  Doors,  to  the 
Bishop:  and  the  Bishop  washeth  his  hands,  according  to  the  rite,  and  saith  the 
Prayer.  Then  he  signeth  the  water  with  his  hand,  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  thrice. 
And  the  Bishop,  with  this  holy  water,  wetteth  his  eyes  and  ears,  nostrils,  and  lips. 
And  at  the  Great  Entrance,  the  Candidate  for  Holy  Orders  walketh  behind  all  the 
clergy.     Then  the  Bishop  saith: 

And  may  the  mercy  of  the  great  God,  and  of  our  Saviour  Jesus  Christ, 
be  with  you  all.     (See  Liturgy,  page  79.) 

And  after  the  Exclamation  he  is  led  into  the  Sanctuary  by  the  Sub-Deacons,  according 
to  the  rubric,  and  having  received  the  Bishop's  blessing,  he  taketh  his  stand  with  the 
Sub-Deacons.  (2) 


THE  FORM  WHICH  IS  USED  AT  THE  ORDINATION 

OF  A  DEACON  * 

After  the  Bishop  hath  said:  (See  the  Liturgy,  page  in.) 
And  may  the  mercy  of  the  great  God,  and  of  our  Saviour  Jesus  Christ, 
be  with  you  all : 

The  Sub-Deacons  bring  the  Bishop's  pontifical  seat  and  place  it  in  front,  and  some- 
what toward  the  left  side  of  the  Holy  Altar,  that  he  may  not  turn  his  back  upon  the 
Holy  Things.  And  the  Bishop  seateth  himself  thereon;  and  two  Sub-Deacons  take 
him  who  is  to  receive  the  Laying-on  of  Hands  from  the  middle  of  the  Church,  having 
him  between  them,  and  each  laying  one  hand  upon  his  neck,  and  holding  him  by  the 
hands  with  the  other:  and  they  bow  him  down  as  lozv  as  possible.  And  one  Deacon 
in  the  Sanctuary  saith: 

Command. 

And  leading  him  forward  a  little,  they  bow  him  down  again.  And  another  Deacon 
saith: 

Command  (3). 

And  thereupon  they  draw  near  to  the  Holy  Door,  bowing  him  down  before  the  Bishop. 
Then  the  Proto-Deacon  saith: 

Command,  Most  Reverend  Master. 

Then  the  Sub-Deacons  leave  him  who  is  to  receive  Ordination  at  the  Holy  Door: 
whereupon  two  others,  a  Proto-Deacon  and  a  Deacon,  take  him,  the  one  by  the  right 
hand,  the  other  by  the  left;  and  he  boweth  before  the  Bishop.  Then  the  Bishop 
signeth  him  with  his  hand  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  and  they  walk  round  the  Holy 
Altar,  (4)  they  that  lead  him  and  the  rest,  singing: 

O  holy  Martyrs,  who  fought  the  good  fight  and  have  received  your 
crowns:  Entreat  ye  the  Lord  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Then  those  who  are  without  the  Sanctuary  sing  the  same,  once.  And  he  who  is  to 
receive  the  Laying-on  of  Hands  kisseth  the  four  corners  of  the  Holy  Altar,  and  the 
hand  and  knee  of  the  Bishop.  (5) 

Then  they  compass  about  the  Altar  again,  singing: 
Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  the  Apostles'  boast,  the  Martyrs'  joy, 
whose  preaching  was  the  consubstantial  Trinity. 

And  the  Choir  without  singeth  the  same,  once.  And  again  he  who  is  to  receive  Ordina- 
tion kisseth  the  Holy  Altar,  and  the  epigonation  and  hand  of  the  Bishop.  Then 
they  compass  about  the  Altar  again,  singing: 

Rejoice,  O  Isaiah !  A  Virgin  is  with  child,  and  shall  bear  a  Son,  Emman- 
uel, both  God  and  man;  and  Orient  is  his  name;  whom  magnifying  we  call 
the  Virgin  blessed. 

*  See  Appendix  B,  VIII  (2). 


3I2       THE  FORM  USED  AT  THE  ORDINATION  OF  A  DEACON 

And  they  do  according  to  the  Ritual.     And  those  without  sing  the  same. 

Then  the  Bishop  riseth,  and  the  pontifical  chair  is  removed;  and  he  who  is  to  receive 
the  laying-on  of  hands  goeth  to  the  right  side  of  the  Bishop,  and  boweth  down  before 
the  Holy  Altar,  thrice,  saying: 

O  God,  have  mercy  upon  me,  a  sinner. 

And  bending  the  right  knee  (6)  he  layeth  his  palms  upon  the  Holy  Altar,  in  the  form 
of  a  cross,  and  placeth  his  brow  between  his  hands  on  the  Holy  Altar.  Then  the 
Bishop  layeth  the  end  of  his  stole  upon  his  head,  and  (7)  Uesseth  him,  thrice,  upon 
the  head,  and  when  the  Proto-Deacon,  or  the  Deacon,  hath  said: 

Let  us  attend: 

The  Bishop,  laying  his  hand  on  the  Candidate's  head,  saith,  aloud,  in  the  hearing  of 
all  those  who  are  in  the  Church: 

The  grace  divine,  which  always  healeth  that  which  is  infirm,  and  com- 
pleteth  that  which  is  wanting,  elevateth,  through  the  laying-on  of  hands, 
N..  the  most  devout  Sub-Deacon,  to  be  a  Deacon:  Wherefore,  let  us  pray 
for  him,  that  the  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit  may  come  upon  him. 

Then  the  Priests  in  the  Sanctuary,  on  the  right  side,  chant:  Lord,  have  mercy. 
(Thrice.)  Likewise,  those  on  the  left:  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.)  And  the 
singers  without  in  the  right  and  left  Choirs:  Kyrie  eleison  (thrice,  slowly),  while  th-e 
Bishop  reciteth  this 

Prayer. 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  by  thy  foreknowl- 
edge dost  send  down  the  fulness  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  upon  whose  who  are  ordained  by 
thine  inscrutable  power  to  be  thy  servitors, 
and  to  administer  thy  spotless  Sacraments: 
Do  thou,  the  same  Sovereign  Master,  pre- 
serve also  this  man,  whom  thou  hast  been 
pleased  to  ordain,  through  me,  by  the  Lay- 
ing-on of  Hands,  to  the  service  of  the  Di- 
aconate,  in  all  soberness  of  life,  holding  the  mystery  of  the  faith  in  a 
pure  conscience.  Vouchsafe  unto  him  the  grace  which  thou  didst 
grant  unto  Stephen,  thy  first  Martyr,  whom,  also,  thou  didst  call 
to  be  the  first  in  the  work  of  thy  ministry;  and  make  him  worthy 
to  administer  after  thy  pleasure  the  degree  which  it  hath  seemed 
good  to  thee  to  confer  upon  him.  For  they  who  minister  well  prepare 
for  themselves  a  good  degree.  And  manifest  him  as  wholly  thy 
servant. 

For  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen.

THE  FORM  USED  AT  THE  ORDINATION  OF  A  DEACON       313 


And  the  Bishop,  keeping  his  hand 
on  the  head  of  him  who  is  receiv- 
ing Holy  Orders,  prayeth  the 
while: 

O  God  our  Saviour,  who  by 
thine  incorruptible  voice  didst 
appoint  unto  thine  Apostles  the 
law  of  the  Diaconate,  and  didst 
manifest  the  first  Martyr,  Ste- 
phen, to  be  of  the  same;  and 
didst  proclaim  him  the  first  who 
should  exercise  the  office  of  a 
Deacon,  as  it  is  written  in  thy 
Holy  Gospel:  Whosoever  de- 
sireth  to  be  first  among  you,  let 
him  be  your  servant:  Do  thou, 
O  Master  of  all  men,  fill  also 
this  thy  servant,  whom  thou 
hast  graciously  permitted  to 
enter  upon  the  ministry  of  a 
Deacon,  with  all  faith,  and  love, 
and  power,  and  holiness, 
through  the  inspiration  of  thy 
holy  and  life-giving  Spirit;  for 
not  through  the  Laying-on  of 
my  hands,  but  through  the 
visitation  of  thy  rich  bounties, 
is  grace  bestowed  upon  thy 
worthy  ones:  That  he,  being 
devoid  of  all  sin,  may  stand 
blameless  before  thee  in  the  ter- 
rible Day  of  thy  Judgment,  and 
receive  the  unfailing  reward  of 
thy  promise. 


Then  the  Proto-Deacon  saith  softly, 
in  a  low  voice: 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the 
Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

For  the  peace  that  is  from 
above,  and  for  the  salvation  of 
our  souls:   Ц

and  for  his  priesthood,  succour,

For  the  servant  of  God,  N., 
who  hath  now  received  the 
Laying-on  of  Hands  to  be  a 
Deacon,  and  for  his  salva-

Succour  us,  save  us,  have 
mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy  grace.

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  they  raise  the  Candidate,  and  loose  his  stole,  which  is  bound  cross-wise.  And 
taking  the  stole,  the  Bishop  layeth  it  on  his  left  shoulder,  saying  in  a  loud  voice: 

Axios!  (Worthy!)  (8) 

And  they  within  the  Sanctuary  sing,  thrice: 

Axios. 

And  likewise  they  without,  in  both  Choirs,  sing,  thrice: 

Axios. 

Then  the  gauntlets  are  given  to  him,  and  the  Bishop  saith: 

Axios. 

And  they  within  the  Sanctuary,  and  they  without,  sing  the  same,  as  before. 

Then  the  sacramental  fan  is  given  to  him,  and  the  Bishop  saith: 

Axios. 

And  they  who  are  within,  and  without,  the  Sanctuary,  sing,  as  before.  And  he  kisseth 
the  Bishop  on  the  shoulder,  and  placeth  himself  at  the  Altar,  and  fanneth  the  Holy 
Gifts. 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  ELEVATION  OF  AN 
ARCHDEACON,  OR  A  PROTO-DEACON 

He  that  is  to  be  raised  to  the  Archdiaconate  is  led,  by  a  Proto-Deacon  and  a  Deacon, 
to  the  Reverend  Bishop,  in  the  middle  of  the  Church,  where  the  Bishop  standeth,  at 
the  time  when  the  Lesser  Entrance  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  is  made.  (See 
page  84.)  And  he  boweth,  thrice,  before  the  Bishop,  even  to  his  girdle,  and  bendeth 
his  head.  Then  the  Bishop,  sitting,  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross,  thrice,  with  his 
hand,  upon  his  head;  and  rising,  layeth  his  hand  upon  his  head.  And  when  the 
Deacon  hath  said: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord : 

The  Bishop  rcciteth  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  bestowed  upon  our  race  the  Arch- 
deaconship,  granting,  through  thine  unspeakable  providence,  that  they 
who  are  endued  therewith  may  order  and  serve  thy  Divine  Mysteries  as 
lesser  ministers:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  endue  with  this  grace  of  the 
Archdeaconship  this  thy  servant,  N.,  and  adorn  him  with  thine  integrity, 
to  stand  at  the  head  of  the  Deacons  of  thy  people,  and  to  be  an  example 
of  good  to  those  who  are  under  him.  Cause  him  to  attain  unto  a  ripe  old 
age,  that  he  may  magnify  thy  glorious  Name,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  upon  his  head,  saying: 
Blessed  is  the  Lord.     Lo,  the  servant  of  God,  N.,  becometh  an  Arch- 
deacon (or  a  Proto-Deacon) :  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son, 
and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

And  laying  his  hand  upon  the  head  of  him  that  is  elevated,  the  Bishop  exclaimeth: 

Axios!     (Thrice.)* 

And  the  Choir  singeth,  thrice: 

Axios. 

And  then  they  enter  the  Sanctuary,  according  to  the  Ritual. 

*  See  Appendix  B,  VTII  (8). 


THE  FORM  AND  MANNER  OF  ORDAINING  A 

PRIEST  * 

After  the  Cherubimic  Hymn  hath  been  finished  {see  page  98),  he  who  is  to  be  ordained 
Priest  is  led  by  an  Archdeacon,  or  another  Deacon,  in  the  same  manner,  and  after 
the  same  exclamations  of  Command  and  Command,  as  at  the  ordination  of  a  Dea- 
con, through  the  Holy  Door,  to  the  Holy  Altar,  before  the  Bishop,  at  the  right  hand 
side  thereof.  The  Bishop  signeth  him  with  his  hand,  in  the  form  of  a  cross:  and  he 
is  led  thrice  round  the  Altar,  as  is  described  in  the  Office  for  making  a  Deacon, 
{see  page  312)  while  all  within  the  Sanctuary  sing  the  following  Hymns: 

O  holy  Martyrs,  who  fought  the  good  fight  and  have  received  your 
crowns:  Entreat  ye  the  Lord  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  the  Apostles'  boast,  the  Martyrs'  joy, 
whose  preaching  was  the  consubstantial  Trinity 

Rejoice,  O  Isaiah!  A  Virgin  is  with  child,  and  shall  bear  a  Son,  Em- 
manuel, both  God  and  man :  and  Orient  is  his  name;  whom  magnifying  we 
call  the  Virgin  blessed. 

Then  he  who  is  to  be  ordained  bendeth  both  knees,  and  placeth  his  brow  between  Ms 
palms  crossed  upon  the  Holy  Altar,  and  the  Bishop  layeth  the  end  of  his  stole  upon 
the  head  of  him  who  is  to  receive  the  Laying-on  of  Hands,  and  blesseth  him,  thrice, 
upon  the  head.     And  when  the  principal  Priest  hath  said: 

Let  us  attend. 

The  Bishop,  laying  his  hand  upon  his  head,  pronounceth,  aloud,  in  the  hearing  of  all 
those  who  stand  in  the  Church: 

The  grace  divine,  which  always  healeth  that  which  is  infirm,  and  com- 
pleteth  (1)  that  which  is  wanting,  elevateth  through  the  laying-on  of 
hands,  N.,  the  most  devout  Deacon,  to  be  a  Priest.  Wherefore,  let  us 
pray  for  him,  that  the  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit  may  come  upon  him. 


Then  the  Proto-Deacon  saith  in  a 
low  voice: 


Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  Priests  within  the  Sanc- 
tuary sing:  Lord,  have  mercy, 
thrice  on  the  right  side,  and  again 
thrice  on  the  left  side. 

And  the  Singers  without,  in  the 
right  and  left  Choirs,  sing:  Kyrie 
eleison  {thrice,  slowly),  while  the 
Bishop  reciteth  the  Prayer. 


And  the  Bishop,  again  blessing  him 
thrice,  reciteth,  secretly,  the  following 
Prayer: 

O  God,  who  hast  no  beginning 
and  no  ending;  who  art  older  than 
every  created  thing;  who  crown  - 
est  with  the  name  of  Presbyter 
those  whom  thou  deemest  worthy 
to  serve  the  word  of  thy  truth 
in  the  divine  ministry  of  this 
degree:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord 
of  all  men,  deign  to  preserve  in 
pureness  of  life  and  in  unswerv-

Choir.  Amen. 

And  the  Proto-Deacon  saith,  in  a 
low  voice: 


Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest,  in  a  low  voice, 
reciteth  the  Litany  of  Peace. 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the 
Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Exclamation. 

Bishop.  For  blessed  and  glorified  is  thine  all-holy  and  majestic  Name, 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages.  ' 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  they  raise  up  the  Candidate,  and  bring  the  Priest's  stole;  and  taking  the  Dea- 
con's stole  from  him  that  hath  received  the  Laying-on  of  Hands,  the  Bishop  endueth 
him  with  the  priestly  stole,  after  he  hath  blessed  it;  and  he  that  receiveth  it  kisseth  it, 
and  the  hand  of  the  Bishop.  And  the  Bishop  layeth  it  about  his  neck,  saying, 
loudly : 

Axios!     (Worthy!) 

And  they  within  the  Sanctuary  sing  the  same: 

Axios.     (Thrice.) 

And  the  Singers  without,  in  both  Choirs,  sing  also: 

Axios.     (Thrice.) 

The  Bishop  then,  in  like  manner,  endueth  him  with  the  zone,  and  he  kisseth  it,  and 
the  hand  of  the  Bishop,  and  girdeth  himself.     And  the  Bishop  saith: 

Axios.  (8) 

And  they  within  the  Sanctuary  and  they  without  do  the  same. 

Thus  they  do  also  with  the  chasuble:  and  with  the  Service-Book,  which  is  given  to  him 
as  his  guide  in  the  holy  ministry;  for  he  saith  not  from  memory  the  Prayers,  but 
readeth  them. 

Then  they  sing  as  usual,  and  the  Priest  who  hath  received  the  Layino-on  of  Hands 
goeth  forth,  after  he  hath  kissed  the  Bishop's  stole  and  his  hand,  and  kisseth  the 
Archimandrites,  and  all  his  fellow-clergy,  on  the  shoulder;  and  taketh  his  place 
among  the  Priests. 


THE  FORM  AND  MANNER  OF  MAKING  AN 

ARCHPRIEST 

He  who  is  to  be  advanced  to  the  rank  of  Archpriest  is  conducted  by  a  Proto-Deacon,  or 
by  two  Deacons,  to  the  Right  Reverend  Bishop,  in  the  middle  of  the  Church,  at  the 
time  when  the  Little  Entrance  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  is  made.  He 
boweth  before  the  Bishop,  even  to  the  girdle,  thrice,  and  bendeth  his  head.  And  the 
Bishop,  as  he  sitteth,  signeth  him,  thrice,  upon  the  head,  in  cross-form,  with  his 
hand.  Then,  rising,  he  layeth  his  hand  upon  the  Priest's  head.  And  after  the 
Proto-Deacon  hath  said: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord : 

The  Bishop  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  our  God,  who  hast  bestowed  the  priest- 
hood upon  our  race,  and  hast  endued  us  with  the  grace  of  this  gift  and 
honour,  and  hast  appointed  us  who  are  duly  devout  to  exercise  command 
over  the  members  of  the  Priesthood,  and  the  other  servitors  in  lesser 
degree  of  thy  Mysteries:  Endue  thou  now,  also,  with  thy  grace,  our 
brother  N.,  and  adorn  him  with  integrity;  that  he  may  stand  at  the  head 
of  the  Priests  of  thy  people.  And  enable  him  to  set  a  good  example  to 
those  who  are  with  him;  and  graciously  grant  that  he  may  attain,  in 
piety  and  veneration,  unto  a  good  old  age;  and  have  mercy  upon  us  all, 
inasmuch  as  thou  art  a  good  God.  For  thou  art  the  bestower  of  wisdom; 
and  unto  thee  doth  all  creation  sing  praises  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Then  the  Bishop  signeth  him  upon  the  head  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  saying: 

Blessed  is  the  Lord.     Lo,  the  servant  of  God,  N.,  is  made  an  Archpriest 

of  God's  holy  Church,  N. :  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 

of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Then,  laying  his  hand  upon  the  Priest's  head,  the  Bishop  exclaimeth: 

Axios!     (Thrice.)* Choir.  Axios!     (Thrice.) 

Then  they  place  the  Archpriest  with  the  other  clergy,  according  to  their  rank,  and  enter 
the  Sanctuary  through  the  Holy  Door,  and  minister  with  the  Clergy. 

*  Appendix  B,  VIII  (8). 


THE  OFFICE  THAT  IS  USED  AT  THE   INSTITU- 
TION OF  AN  ABBOT 

He  who  is  to  be  elevated  to  the  rank  of  Abbot  is  led  by  a  Proto-Deacon,  or  by  two  Dea- 
cons, to  the  Bishop,  in  the  middle  of  the  Church,  where  the  Bishop  standeth,_  at  the 
time  of  the  Lesser  Entrance  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  {see  page  84),  if  so  be 
that  the  Bishop  himself  officiate  at  the  Liturgy.  But  if  not,  then  they  bring  to  the 
Bishop  his  priestly  stole,  gauntlets  and  omofor  and  he  vesteth  himself  where  he 
slandeth.  He  who  is  to  be  advanced  to  the  rank  of  Abbot  is  brought  to  his  appointed 
place,  and  boweth  low  to  the  Bishop,  even  to  his  girdle,  thrice,  and  bendeth  his  head. 
And  the  Bishop,  sitting,  signeth  his  head,  thrice,  with  his  hand,  in  the  form  of  a 
cross.  And  rising,  he  layeth  his  hand  upon  his  head;  and  when  the  Proto-Deacon 
hath  said: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord : 

The  Bishop  reciteth  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God,  who  ever  exercisest  divine  foresight  concerning  the  salvation 
of  men,  and  hast  gathered  into  one  this  reason-endowed  flock:  Do  thou, 
O  Master  of  all,  through  thy  boundless  love  for  mankind,  preserve  the 
same  spotless,  ever  keeping  thy  commandments,  that  not  one  sheep  perish 
therefrom,  or  be  devoured  by  the  wolf.  And  make  this  thy  servant,  whom 
thou  hast  been  graciously  pleased  to  set  over  it  as  Abbot,  worthy  of  thy 
goodness;  and  adorn  him  with  all  virtues,  that  through  his  own  deeds  he 
may  offer  a  good  example  to  those  who  are  subject  unto  him;  that  they, 
being  moved  to  emulate  his  blameless  life,  may,  with  him,  stand  uncon- 
demned  before  thy  dread  Judgment  Seat. 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Bishop.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Proto-Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Bishop  saith,  secretly,  the  following  Prayer: 
Incline  thine  ear,  O  Lord,  and  hear  our  prayers;  and  cause  this 
thy  servant,  the  Abbot  of  this  venerable  habitation,  to  be  a  wise  and 
faithful  steward  of  the  reason-endowed  flock  which,  through  thy 
grace,  hath  been  entrusted  unto  him,  working  thy  will  in  all  things, 
and  becoming  worthy  of  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

Through  the  grace,  and  bounties,  and  love  towards  mankind  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages .    Amen .

THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  INSTITUTION  OF  AN  ABBOT  321 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon  saith,  loudly: 
Command,  Master. 

And  the  Bishop,  also,  with  a  loud  voice: 
The  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit,  at  the  hands  of  our  humble  person, 
promoteth  thee  to  be  Abbot  of  the  honourable  habitation  of  our  Lord  and 
God,  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,  N.  (if  the  Temple  be  dedicated  to  him);  or 
of  our  most  holy  Sovereign  Lady,  the  Mother  of  our  Lord,  N.  (if  the 
Temple  be  dedicated  to  her) ;  or  of  Saint  N .  (if  the  Temple  be  dedicated  to  a 

Saint) . 

Then,  laying  his  hand  upon  his  head,  the  Bishop  exclaimeth: 

Axios!     (Thrice.) 

And  the  Choir  singeth- 

Axios.     (Thrice.) 

Then  he  who  hath  been  invested  with  the  office  of  Abbot  kisseth  the  pall  *  of  the  Bishop 
on  the  right,  and  on  the  left  shoulder:  and  being  led  away,  he  taketh  his  place  with 
the  other  Abbots,  according  to  their  rank:  and  they  enter  the  Sanctuary  through  the 
Holy  Door;  and  he  ministereth  with  the  other  clergy,  according  to  the  Ritual. 

*  See  Appendix  B,  VIII  (11). 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  ELEVATION  OF  AN 

ARCHIMANDRITE 

He  who  is  to  be  installed  as  Archimandrite  is  led  by  the  Proto-Deacon,  or  by  two 
Deacons,  to  the  Bishop,  in  the  middle  of  the  Church,  where  the  Bishop  standeth, 
at  the  time  of  the  Little  Entrance  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  (see  page  84), 
if  the  Bishop  himself  be  the  celebrant  at  the  Divine  Liturgy.  But  if  not,  then  they 
bring  to  the  Bishop  his  priestly  stole,  his  gauntlets,  and  his  pall,,  and  he  vesteth 
himself  where  he  standeth.  He  who  is  to  be  installed  as  Archimandrite,  being 
brought  to  his  appointed  place,  boweth  before  the  Bishop,  even  to  his  girdle,  and 
bendeth  his  head.  And  the  Bishop,  sitting,  maketh  thrice,  with  his  hand,  the  sign 
of  the  cross  over  his  head.  And  if  the  Candidate  for  the  rank  of  Archimandrite  be 
already  an  Abbot,  the  Prayers  at  the  Elevation  of  an  Abbot  are  not  used,  and  the 
Proto-Deacon  saith  only,  aloud: 

Command,  Master: 

And  the  Bishop  saith,  in  a  loud  voice: 
The  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit,  through  our  humility  promoteth  thee 
to  be  Archimandrite  of  the  venerable  habitation  of  our  Lord,  and  God, 
and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ;  or  of  our  most  holy  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of 
God  (if  the  Temple  be  dedicated  to  her) ;  or  of  Saint  N.  (if  it  be  dedicated  to  a 
Saint) . 

Then,  laying  his  hand  upon  the  head  of  him  who  is  being  elevated,  the  Bishop  ex- 

claimeth: 

Axios!     (Thrice.)* 
Choir.  Axios.     (Thrice.) 

And  if  a  mitre  is  to  be  conferred  upon  an  Archimandrite,  then,  after  the  Little  En- 
trance from  the  Sanctuary,  with  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  the  Archimandrite  is 
led  to  the  Bishop.  And  the  Bishop  saith  no  prayer,  but  only  blesseth  the  Archi- 
mandrite with  his  hand.  And  the  Archimandrite  kisseth  the  hand  of  the  Bishop, 
and  the  mitre;  and  the  mitre  is  then  put  upon  the  Archimandrite.  Then  he  is  led 
away,  and  placed  with  the  other  Archimandrites  and  Abbots,  according  to  his  rank. 
And  they  enter  the  Sanctuary  through  the  Holy  Door,  and  minister  with  the  Clergy 
who  are  celebrating,  according  to  the  Ritual. 

And  at  the  end  of  the  Divine  Liturgy  the  Bishop,  giving  the  Archimandrite  (or  Abbot) 
his  pastoral  staff,  saith: 

Take  this  staff  and  with  it  establish  and  rule  thy  flock:  seeing  that  thou 
must  answer  therefor  to  our  Lord  God,  on  the  Day  of  Judgment. 

Then  the  Bishop  exhorteth  him  and  his  flock  to  the  observance  of  their  respective  duties. 

*  See  Appendix  B,  VIII  (8). 


THE  ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING 

A  BISHOP  * 

When  the  time  is  come  for  electing  a  Bishop  to  a  vacant  Episcopal  Throne,  the  Most 
Holy  Synod  taketh  counsel  as  to  who  knoweth  of  a  fitting  incumbent  of  such  a  dig- 
nity; and  when  such  person  hath  been  selected,  the  Nomination  of  him  who  is  des- 
ignated to  the  Bishopric  is  made  after  the  following  manner: 

When  the  time  is  come,  the  Bishops  and  Candidate-elect  are  summoned  to  the  Most 
Holy  Synod;  and  when  they  are  assembled,  the  Presiding  Bishop  putteth  on  his 
priestly  stole. 

Then  announcement  is  made  to  the  Bishop-elect  by  the  Chief  Secretary  in  this  wise: 
Honourable  Father  Archimandrite  (or  Hiero-Monk),  N.:  Our  Ruler,  by 
an  edict  signed  with  his  name,  commandeth,  and  the  Most  Holy  Synod 
assenteth  thereto,  that  your  Holiness  shall  be  the  Bishop  of  the  God- 
saved  cities,  NN 

And  thereto  the  Bishop-elect  maketh  answer: 
Seeing  that  our  Ruler,  N.,  hath  commanded  my  preferment,  and  that  the 
Most  Holy  Governing  Synod  hath  judged  me  worthy  of  this  ministry,  I 
return  thanks,  and  accept,  and  say  nothing  contrary  thereto. 

Then  the  Presiding  Bishop  beginneth: 
Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir    Amen. 

The  others  say: 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come,  and 
take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save  our 
souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ;  But  deliver  us  from 
the  Evil  One: 

The  Presiding  Bishop.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom  and  the  power,  and  the 
glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

*  Appendix  B,  VIII. 


324        ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP 
The  others  recite  the  following  Hymn  (Tropdr): 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Christ-God,  who  hast  revealed  the  fishers  most  wise, 
sending  down  upon  them  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  thereby  catching  the  uni- 
verse as  in  a  net.     Glory  to  thee,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk) : 

When  the  Most  High  descended  confounding  the  tongues,  he  dispersed 
abroad  the  nations:  but  when  he  distributed  the  tongues  of  fire,  he  called 
all  men  unto  unity.  Wherefore,  with  one  accord,  we  glorify  the  all-holy 
Spirit. 

Then  the  Presiding  Bishop  reciteth  this  Litany: 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.   Ц 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.;  and 
for  all  the  Authorities,   fy 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  the  Most  Holy  Synod.  R,

Hiero-Monk),  N.,  the  newly-elected  Bishop  of  the  God-saved 
cities,  NN.   Ц 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  all  the  brotherhood,  and  for  all 
Orthodox  Christians.  fy 

Exclamation. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Bless,  Master. 

And  the  Benediction. 
May  he  who,  in  the  form  of  tongues  of  fire,  sent  down  from  heaven 
the  Holy  Spirit  upon  his  Disciples  and  Apostles,  Christ  our  true  God; 
through  the  prayers  of  his  all-pure  Mother,  of  the  honourable,  glorious 
Prophet,  the  Forerunner  and  Baptist,  John,  and  of  Saint  N.  (whose  day

(See  page  540.) 

And  -when  this  is  finished,  the  Chief  Bishop  riseth  and  blesseth  the  Bishop-elect  with 
the  cross,  and  sprinkleth  him  with  holy  water,  and  each  one  of  them  then  departeth 
to  his  own  abode. 

CONSECRATION 

On  the  day  when  the  Consecration  is  to  take  place,  the  bells  are  pealed  for  the  Vigil 
Service,  according  to  the  Ritual:  and  at  the  Ninth  Theme-Song  of  the  Canon  the 
great  bell  peals. 

And  the  Bishops  and  others  assemble  in  the  Cathedral  Church,  and  having  vested 
themselves  according  to  the  Ritual,  they  ascend  the  tribune,  preceded  by  the  Archi- 
mandrite, the  Abbot,  and  the  Archpriest,  and  all  the  Clergy. 

And  in  the  middle  of  the  Church,  near  the  tribune,  on  the  ecclesiastical  carpet,  there  is 
placed  the  figure  of  a  one-headed  eagle,  having  its  wings  outspread,  standing  upright 
on  its  feet;  and  under  its  feet  is  a  city  with  walls  and  towers,  and  the  eagle,  as  it 
were,  treading  upon  the  towers  thereof.  And  this  is  guarded  so  that  no  one  may 
step  upon  the  eagle.  (12) 

Then  the  Bishops  command  the  Archpriest  and  the  Proto-Deacon  to  summon  him 
who  is  to  receive  consecration:  and  they,  doing  reverence  and  kissing  the  hands  of  the 
Bishops,  take  the  Candidate  for  consecration,  who  is  in  the  Sanctuary,  clad  in  all 
the  vestments  of  a  Priest,  and  lead  him  upon  the  tail  of  the  eagle;  and  he  maketh  three 
reverences.  The  Proto-Deacon  first  leadeth  the  Bishop-elect,  proclaiming  and 
saying,  in  an  audible  voice,  these  things  following: 

The  most  God-beloved,  elect  and  confirmed  Archimandrite  (or  Hiero- 
Monk),  N.,  is  led  forth  for  consecration  to  the  Bishopric  of  the  God- 
saved  city,  N.  (cities  NN.). 

And  to  the  Bishop-elect,  holding  in  his  hands  the  holy  writing  of  the  Orthodox  faith, 
the  Chief  Bishop  saith: 

Wherefore  art  thou  come,  and  what  dost  thou  ask  of  our  meekness? 

The  Bishop-elect  maketh  answer,  saying: 
The  laying-on  of  hands,  unto  the  grace  of  the  Bishop's  office,  Most 
Reverend  Sirs. 

And  the  Bishop  questioneth  him,  saying: 

And  how  believest  thou? 

And  the  Bishop-elect  reciteth,  aloud,  The  Symbol  of  the  Faith: 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible: 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  Only-begotten  Son  of  God,  begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God; 
Begotten,  not  made;  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom  all 
things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came  down 
from  heaven.  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin  Mary, 
And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius  Pilate, 
and  suffered  and  was  buried.  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again,  according 


326        ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP 

to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both 
the  quick  and  the  dead;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end. 

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord,  the  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth 
from  the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and 
Apostolic  Church.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission  of  sins. 
I  look  for  the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  And  the  Life  of  the  world  to  come 
Amen. 

And  ivhen  he  hath  said  this,  the  Bishop  blesseth  him  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  and 
saith: 

The  grace  of  God  the  Father,  and  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  be  with  thee. 

The  Bishop-elect  is  then  led  to  the  middle  of  the  eagle,  the  Proto-Deacon  proclaiming 

his  being  led,  as  was  explained  above: 
The  most  God-beloved       .  is  led  .  .  .  and  so  forth,  as  before. 

And  when  the  Bishop-elect  hath  been  placed  upon  the  centre  of  the  eagle,  the  Chief 
Bishop  directeth  his  words  to  him,  and  saith: 

Reveal  unto  us  more  particularly  how  thou  believest  concerning  the 
properties  of  the  three  Persons  of  the  ineffable  Godhead,  and  concerning 
the  Incarnation  of  the  Person  of  the  Son  and  Word  of  God 

And  the  Bishop-elect  immediately  readeth,  aloud,  the  Second  Confession  of 
Faith,  as  followeth: 

I  believe  in  one  God,  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
and  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible;  For  he  is  without  beginning,  unbe- 
gotten,  and  without  cause,  but  is  himself  the  natural  beginning  and  cause 
of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Spirit.  And  I  believe  in  his  Only-begotten  Son, 
without  mutation  and  without  time  begotten  of  him,  being  of  one  Essence 
with  Him  by  whom  all  things  were  made.  And  I  believe  in  the  Holy 
Spirit,  who  proceedeth  from  the  same  Father,  and  with  him  is  glorified 
as  coeternal,  being  of  one  Essence  with  him,  and  equal  in  glory,  and 
enthroned  together  with  him,  the  Author  of  creation.  I  believe  that  one 
of  the  same  super-substantial  and  life-giving  Trinity,  the  Only-begotten 
Word,  came  down  from  heaven,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  and 
was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Spirit  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  and  was  made  man; 
that  is  to  say,  was  made  perfect  man,  yet  remaining  God,  and  in  nowise 
changing  his  divine  essence  by  his  participation  in  the  flesh,  neither  being 
transmuted  into  anything  else:  but  without  mutation  assuming  man's 
nature,  he  therein  endured  suffering  and  death,  being  free  in  his  divine 
nature  from  every  suffering.  And  on  the  third  day  he  rose  again  from 
the  dead;  and  ascended  into  heaven,  and  sitteth  on  the  right  hand  of  his 
God  and  Father.  And  I  believe  those  traditions  and  narrations  concern- 
ing the  one  Catholic  and  Apostolic  Church  which  we  have  received  from 


ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP       327 

God  and  the  men  of  God.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission 
of  sins.  I  look  for  the  Resurrection  of  the  dead,  and  the  life  of  the  world 
to  come.  Furthermore  I  confess  the  one  Person,  the  Word  made  flesh; 
and  I  believe  and  proclaim  that  Christ  is  one  and  the  same  in  two  natures 
after  his  incarnation,  preserving  those  things  which  were  in  them  and 
from  them.  Therefore,  also,  I  adore  two  wills,  in  that  each  nature  re- 
taineth  its  own  special  will  and  its  own  action.  I  reverence,  relatively, 
but  not  in  the  way  of  worship,  the  images  divine  and  reverence-worthy 
of  Christ  himself,  and  of  the  all-undefiled  Mother  of  God,  and  of  all  the 
Saints,  addressing  to  their  originals  the  honour  shown  to  them.  I  reject 
as  ill-advised  those  who  think  otherwise.  And  I  literally  and  truly  confess 
our  Sovereign  Lady,  Mary  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  as  having  borne  in  the 
flesh  one  of  the  Trinity,  even  Christ  our  God.  And  may  the  same  be  my 
helper,  protector,  and  defender  all  the  days  of  my  life.     Amen. 

And  immediately  the  Bishop  saith,  blessing  in  the  form  of  a  cross  him  who  is  receiving 
Consecration: 

The  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit  be  with  thee,  enlightening,  strengthening 
and  endowing  thee  with  wisdom  all  the  days  of  thy  life. 

Then  the  Bishop-elect  is  led  upon  the  head  of  the  eagle,  and  after  the  Proto-Deacon 
hath  proclaimed  his  preferment,  as  above  described,  and  hath  placed  him  on  the 
head  of  the  eagle,  the  Bishop  saith  to  him: 

Declare  unto  us,  also,  what  thou  thinkest  concerning  the  Canons  of  the 
holy  Apostles  and  the  holy  Fathers,  and  the  traditions  and  regulations  of 
the  Church. 

And  the  Bishop-elect  immediately  readeth,  in  a  loud  voice,  the  Third  Confession 
of  Faith: 

In  this  my  confession  of  the  holy  faith,  I  promise  to  observe  the  Canons 
of  the  holy  Apostles,  and  of  the  Seven  (Ecumenical  Councils,  and  of  the 
pious  Provincial  Councils,  the  traditions  of  the  Church,  and  the  decrees, 
orders  and  regulations  of  the  Holy  Fathers.  And  all  things  whatsoever 
they  have  accepted  I  also  accept;  and  whatsoever  things  they  have  re- 
jected those  will  I  also  reject. 

I  promise  also  to  preserve  the  peace  of  the  Church,  and  firmly  to  hold 
and  zealously  to  teach  the  people  entrusted  to  me,  and  not  to  devise  any- 
thing whatsoever  which  is  contrary  to  the  Orthodox  Catholic  Christian 
faith  of  the  East  all  the  days  of  my  life;  and  that  I  will,  in  all  things, 
follow  and  always  obey  the  Most  Blessed  Patriarch  and  the  Most  Holy 
Synod;  and  to  be,  in  all  things,  of  one  mind  with  the  Most  Blessed  Patri- 
arch and  with  the  Most  Reverend  Metropolitans,  Archbishops  and 
Bishops,  my  brethren,  and  conjointly  with  them  submissive  to  the  divine 
law,  and  the  sacred  rules  of  the  Holy  Apostles  and  Holy  Fathers;  and 
with  all  sincerity  to  cherish  towards  them  spiritual  affection :  and  to  regard 
them  as  brethren. 


328        ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP 

And  I  promise  to  rule  the  flock  committed  unto  me  in  the  fear  of  God 
and  in  devoutness  of  life;  and  with  all  diligent  heed  to  guard  it  against  all 
heresies  of  doctrine. 

And  I  also  confess,  in  this  my  written  profession  of  faith,  that  neither 
by  the  promise  nor  by  the  gift  of  gold  or  of  silver  am  I  come  to  this  min- 
istry; but,  on  the  contrary,  I  have  received  it  by  the  election  of  the  Most 
Holy  Synod. 

And  herewith  I  promise  also  to  do  nothing  through  constraint,  whether 
coerced  by  powerful  persons,  or  by  a  multitude  of  the  people,  even  though 
they  should  command  me,  under  pain  of  death,  to  do  something  contrary 
to  divine  and  holy  laws:  nor  to  celebrate  the  Divine  Liturgy  in  another 
diocese  than  my  own,  nor  to  exercise  any  other  priestly  function  without 
the  permission  of  the  Bishop  of  that  diocese ;  and  that  I  will  not  ordain 
either  a  Priest,  or  a  Deacon,  or  any  other  ecclesiastic  in  another's  diocese, 
nor  receive  such  into  my  diocese  without  letters  of  dismissal  from  their  own 
Bishops. 

I  will  deal  with  the  opponents  of  the  Holy  Church  with  reasonableness, 
uprightness  and  gentleness,  according  to  the  Apostle  Paul;  And  the 
servant  of  the  Lord  must  not  strive,  but  be  gentle  unto  all  men,  apt  to 
teach,  forbearing,  in  meekness  instructing  those  who  oppose  themselves; 
if  God,  perad venture,  will  give  them  repentance  to  the  acknowledging  of 
the  truth. 

I  promise  to  visit  and  watch  over  the  flock  now  confided  to  me,  after  the 
manner  of  the  Apostles,  whether  they  remain  true  to  the  faith,  and  in  the 
exercise  of  good  works,  more  especially  the  Priests;  and  to  inspect  with 
diligence,  and  to  exhort  and  inhibit,  that  there  may  be  no  schisms,  super- 
stitions and  impious  veneration,  and  that  no  customs  contrary  to  Chris- 
tian piety  and  good  morals  may  injure  Christian  conduct. 

And  all  those  things,  my  bounden  duty,  which  I  have  this  day  prom- 
ised in  word,  I  also  promise  to  perform  in  deed  unto  my  uttermost 
breath,  for  the  sake  of  the  covenanted  good  things  to  come.  And  may 
God,  who  seeth  the  heart,  be  the  witness  to  my  vow.  And  may  our 
Saviour  himself  be  my  helper,  in  my  sincere  and  zealous  government  and 
my  performance  thereof;  and  unto  Him,  together  with  the  Father  and  the 
Holy  Spirit,  be  glory  and  dominion,  honour  and  worship,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  when  this  is  completed,  the  Presiding  Bishop,  blessing  him,  saith: 

The  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  through  my  humility,  exalteth  thee,  most 
God-beloved  Archimandrite  (or  Hiero-Monk),  N.,  to  be  the  Bishop-elect 
of  the  God-saved  cities,  NN. 

And  the  Bishop-elect  maketh  three  reverences  to  the  Presiding  Bishop;  and  the  Proto- 
Deacon  leadeth  him  to  the  Bishops.  And  he,  delivering  to  the  same  the  written 
statement  of  his  faith  and  his  promise,  kisseth  their  right  hands. 


ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP       329 

And  thus  he  descendeth  from  the  tribune  (amvon),  and  makeih  a  reverence.    And 

the  Presiding  Bishop,  signing  him  with  his  hand,  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  saith: 
The  grace  of  the  Most  Holy  Spirit  be  with  thee. 

And  they  lead  him  upon  the  eagle,  and  the  Choir  chanteth  Many  Years  to  the  Ruler 
of  the  Land,  to  the  Synod,  and  to  the  newly-elected  Bishop. 

(The  Divine  Liturgy  is  then  begun,  the  Bishop-elect  standing  until  his  Consecration 
{or  Ordination)  in  the  Deacon's  chapel  (Diakonnik),  or  the  chapel  on  the  south  of 
the  Altar,  fully  vested  as  a  Priest). 

And  after  the  Thrice-Holy  hath  been  sung,  (13;  he  who  is  to  receive  Ordination 
is  led  forth  by  the  Archpriest  and  the  Proto-Deacon,  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door  (see 
page  87) ;  and  is  received  by  the  Bishops  in  the  holy  Sanctuary,  before  the  Holy 
Altar  And  he  straightway  kneeleth  down  on  both  knees,  in  the  midst  of  the 
Bishops.  And  they  take  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  opening  it,  they  lay  it, 
with  the  writing  downward,  upon  his  head,  holding  it  here  and  there.  (14) 

Then  the  Presiding  Bishop  saith,  so  that  all  may  hear: 
By  the  election  and  approbation  of  the  most  God-loving  Bishops,  and 

of  all  the  consecrated  Council, 

The  grace  divine,  which  always  healeth  that  which  is  infirm,  and  cora- 

pleteth  that  which  is  wanting,  through  the  laying-on  of  hands  elevateth 

thee,    the    most    God-loving   Archimandrite  (or  Hiero-Monk)  N.,  duly 

elected,  to  be  the  Bishop  of  the  God-saved  cities,  NN 
Wherefore  let  us  pray  for  him,  that  the  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit  may 

come  upon  him. 

And  a  Priest  saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.     (Thrice.) 

And  while  the  Bishops  hold  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  the  Presiding  Bishop  maketh 
three  crosses  above  the  head  of  him  who  is  being  consecrated,  blessing  him: 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

And  while  the  Bishops  lay  their  right  hands  upon  his  head,  the  Presiding  Bishop 
saith  this  Prayer: 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  through  thine  all-laudable  Apostle  Paul 
hast  established  for  us  an  ordinance  of  degrees  and  ranks,  unto  the  service 
and  divine  celebration  of  thine  august  and  all-spotless  Mysteries  upon 
thy  holy  Altar;  first,  Apostles,  secondly,  Prophets,  thirdly,  teachers:  Do 
thou,  the  same  Lord  of  all,  who  also  hast  graciously  enabled  this  chosen 
person  to  come  under  the  yoke  of  the  Gospel  and  the  dignity  of  a  Bishop 
through  the  laying-on  of  hands  of  us,  his  fellow  Bishops  here  present, 
strengthen  him  by  the  inspiration  and  power  and  grace  of  thy  Holy 
Spirit,  as  thou  didst  strengthen  thy  holy  Apostles  and  Prophets;  as  thou 
didst  anoint  Kings;  as  thou  hast  consecrated  Bishops:  And  make  his 
Bishopric  to  be  blameless;  and  adorning  him  with  all  dignity,  present  thou 
him  holy,  that  he  may  be  worthy  to  ask  those  things  which  are  for  the

salvation  of  the  people,  and  that  thou  mayest  give  ear  unto  him.  For 
blessed  is  thy  Name,  and  glorified  thy  Kingdom,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

And  after  the  Amen,  one  of  the  other  consecrating  Bishops  reciteth  the  following 
petitions  in  a  low  voice,  so  that  only  the  Prelates  there  present  can  hear  and  re- 
spond: 

In  peace,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Lord,  have  mercy 

For  the  peace  that  is  from  above,  and  for  the  salvation  of 
our  souls:   1$ 

For  the  peace  of  the  whole  world ;  for  the  welfare  of  God's

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  when  these  things  have  been  said,  the  Presiding  Bishop,  who  also  hath  his  hand 
upon  the  head  of  him  who  is  receiving  Ordination,  prayeth  thus: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who,  forasmuch  as  it  is  impossible  for  the  nature  of 
man  to  endure  the  Essence  of  the  Godhead,  in  thy  providence  hast  insti- 
tuted for  us  teachers  of  like  nature  with  ourselves,  to  maintain  thine 
Altar,  that  they  may  offer  unto  thee  sacrifice  and  oblation  for  all  thy 
people;  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  make  this  man  also,  who  hath  been  pro- 
claimed a  steward  of  the  episcopal  grace,  to  be  an  imitator  of  thee,  the 
true  Shepherd,  who  didst  lay  down  thy  life  for  thy  sheep;  to  be  a  leader  of 
the  blind,  a  light  to  those  who  are  in  darkness,  a  reprover  of  the  unwise,  a 
teacher  of  the  young,  a  lamp  to  the  world :  that,  having  perfected  the  souls

ORDER  OF  ELECTING  AND  CONSECRATING  A  BISHOP        331 

entrusted  unto  him  in  this  present  life,  he  may  stand  unashamed  before 
thy  throne,  and  receive  the  great  reward  which  thou  hast  prepared  for 
those  who  have  contended  valiantly  for  the  preaching  of  thy  Gospel. 

For  thine  it  is  to  show  mercy,  and  to  save  us,  O  our  God,  and  unto  thee 
do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  after  the  Amen  they  lay  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  upon  the  Altar.  And  the 
Presiding  Bishop  then  putteth  the  dalmatic  (sdkkos)  and  the  other  episcopal  vest- 
ments upon  him  who  hath  received  Consecration,  saying: 

Axios!  (15) 

And  the  Choir  singeth  the  same. 

Then  the  Bishops  kiss  him  who  hath  received  consecration;  and  when  the  customary 
thanksgivings  have  been  said,  the  Presiding  Bishop  proclaimeth  the  Peace  before 
the  Epistle.      And  the  Bishops  go  to  the  episcopal  seats  in  the  apse,  and  sit  there. 

And  the  celebration  of  the  Divine  Liturgy  is  continued. 

And  when  it  is  finished,  they  unvest  in  the  holy  Sanctuary,  and  lead  the  newly-conse- 
crated Bishop  to  the  Presiding  Bishop,  who  putteth  upon  him  the  cassock  of  a 
Bishop;  also  the  pectoral  holy  image,  the  mantle  and  cowl,  blessing  him  with  his 
hand  as  he  doeth  it;  and  he  giveth  him  the  rosary.  Then  the  Bishops  come  forth 
from  the  Sanctuary,  and  ascend  the  dais  (kdthedra)  which  hath  been  prepared;  and 
the  Archpriest  and  the  Proto-Deacon  lead  him  who  hath  received  Consecration  upon 
the  dais;  and  the  Presiding  Bishop  deliver eih  to  him  the  pastoral  staff  (posokh), 
with  an  Exhortation. 

Right  Reverend  Bishop  N.:  .  .  . 

Or,  when  the  Bishop  delivereth  the  staff,  he  useth  this  brief  Exhortation: 

Receive  thou  the  pastoral  staff,  that  thou  mayest  feed  the  flock  of 
Christ  entrusted  unto  thee:  and  be  thou  a  staff  and  support  unto  those 
who  are  obedient.  But  lead  thou  the  disobedient  and  the  wayward  unto 
correction,  unto  gentleness,  and  unto  obedience;  and  they  shall  continue 
in  due  submission. 

Then  they  depart  to  their  abodes,  the  Archpriest  and  the  Proto-Deacon  escorting  the 
newly-ordained  Bishop  to  his  home. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION,  SUNG  BY  SEVEN 
PRIESTS  ASSEMBLED  IN  A  CHURCH,  OR  IN  A 
HOUSE  * 

(THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  VISITATION  OF  THE  SICK) 

A  small  table  is  prepared,  upon  which  is  set  a  vessel  containing  wheat:  and  on  the 
wheat  an  empty  shrine-lamp.  And  round  about  are  set  seven  wands,  wrapped  with 
cotton  for  the  Anointing,  and  thrust  into  the  wheat:  and  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels 
lieth  there  also:  and  tapers  (2)  are  given  to  all  the  Priests.  These  stand  round  about 
the  table  vested  in  their  chasubles.  Then  the  first  Priest  taketh  a  censer  with  incense 
therein,  and  censeth  round  about  the  table  of  the  Holy  Oil  and  the  whole  church  or 
house:  and  taking  his  stand  before  the  table,  with  his  face  to  the  east,  he  beginneth: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  we  begin: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
{Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  in- 
firmities, for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy      (Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom

daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall

THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION  333 

Psalm  cxliii. 

Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  consider  my  desire;  hearken  unto  me  for 
thy  truth  and  righteousness'  sake.  And  enter  not  into  judgment  with 
thy  servant;  for  in  thy  sight  shall  no  man  living  be  justified.  For  the 
enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul;  he  hath  smitten  my  life  down  to  the 
ground;  he  hath  laid  me  in  the  darkness,  as  the  men  that  have  been  long 
dead.  Therefore  is  my  spirit  vexed  within  me;  and  my  heart  within  me  is 
desolate.  Yet  do  I  remember  the  time  past;  I  muse  upon  all  thy  works; 
yea,  I  exercise  myself  in  the  works  of  thy  hands.  I  stretch  forth  my  hands 
unto  thee ;  my  soul  gaspeth  unto  thee  as  a  thirsty  land.  Hear  me,  O  Lord, 
and  that  soon;  for  my  spirit  waxeth  faint:  hide  not  thy  face  from  me,  lest 
I  be  like  unto  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit.  O  let  me  hear  thy  loving- 
kindness  betimes  in  the  morning ;  for  in  thee  is  my  trust ;  show  thou  me  the 
way  that  I  should  walk  in;  for  I  lift  up  my  soul  unto  thee.  Deliver  me, 
O  Lord,  from  mine  enemies;  for  I  flee  unto  thee  to  hide  me.  Teach  me  to 
do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee ;  for  thou  art  my  God ;  let  thy  loving  Spirit 
lead  me  forth  into  the  land  of  righteousness.  Quicken  me,  O  Lord,  for 
thy  Name's  sake;  and  for  thy  righteousness'  sake  bring  my  soul  out  of 
trouble.  And  of  thy  goodness  slay  mine  enemies,  and  destroy  all  them 
that  vex  my  soul;  for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Glory         now,  and  ever,  . 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia;  glory  to  thee,  O  Lord.     (Thrice.) 

And  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  Little  Litany: 

Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Priest.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  immediately  Alleluia,  in  Tone  VI.,  is  sung. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1 :  O  Lord,  rebuke  me  not  in  thine  anger,  neither  chasten 
me  in  thy  sore  displeasure. 

Verse  2:  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  I  am  weak. 

Then  the  Hymns  (Tropari): 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  have  mercy  upon  us.     For  we  sinners, 


334  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION 

void  of  all  defence,  do  offer  unto  thee  as  unto  our  Master,  this  petition: 
Have  mercy  upon  us. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  for  in  thee  have  we  trusted,  and  be  not 
very  wroth  with  us,  neither  call  thou  to  remembrance  our  iniquities;  but 
look  down  even  now  upon  us,  inasmuch  as  thou  art  of  tender  compassion, 
and  deliver  us  from  our  enemies;  for  thou  art  our  God,  and  we  are  thy 
people,  we  are  all  the  work  of  thy  hand,  and  we  call  upon  thy  Name. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Open  unto  us  the  door  of  thy  loving-kindness,  O  blessed  Birth-giver  of 
God.  In  that  we  set  our  hope  on  thee,  may  we  not  fail,  but  through  thee 
may  we  be  delivered  from  all  adversities ;  for  thou  art  the  salvation  of  all 
Christian  people. 

Psalm  li. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me  throughly 
from  my  wickedness,  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I  acknowledge 
my  faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned, 
and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justified  in  thy  say- 
ing, and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold,  I  was  shapen  in  wickedness, 
and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou  requirest  truth  in 
the  inward  parts,  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand  wisdom  secretly 
Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean;  thou  shalt  wash 
me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow  Thou  shalt  make  me  hear  of  joy 
and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may  rejoice.  Turn 
thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds.  Make  me  a  clean 
heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast  me  not  away 
from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy  holy  Spirit  from  me.  0  give  me  the 
comfort  of  thy  help  again,  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free  Spirit.  Then 
shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked,  and  sinners  shall  be  converted 
unto  thee.  Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou  that  art  the 
God  of  my  health ;  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  Thou 
shalt  open  my  lips,  O  Lord,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy  praise.  For 
thou  desirest  no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou  delightest 
not  in  burnt-offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled  spirit:  a 
broken  and  contrite  heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be  favour- 
able and  gracious  unto  Zion;  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem.  Then 
shalt  thou  be  pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with  the  burnt- 
offerings  and  oblations;  then  shall  they  offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine 
altar.

Hymns  (Tropari).  O  Master,  who  ever  makest  glad  the  souls,  and 
likewise  also  the  bodies  of  mortal  men,  with  the  oil  of  loving-kindness, 
and  preservest  also  thy  faithful  by  oil :  Show  compassion  also  unto  those 
who  now  draw  near  unto  thee  through  the  Oil. 

The  whole  earth  is  full  of  thy  mercy,  O  Master:  Wherefore  we,  in  faith, 
do  beseech  thee,  that  thou  wilt  bestow  upon  us,  who  to-day  shall  be 
anointed  with  thy  divine  and  precious  Oil,  thy  mercy  which  passeth 
understanding. 

Glory 

O  thou  who  lovest  mankind,  who  through  thine  Apostle  didst  merci- 
fully give  us  a  command  to  perform  Holy  Unction  upon  thy  sick  servants : 
Do  thou,  through  the  prayers  of  the  same,  have  mercy  upon  us  all,  by 
thy  seal. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  O  only  Pure  One,  who

Canticle  III.

Thou  art  my  fortress,  O  Lord,  my  refuge  and  my  strength. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Thou  who  alone  art  wonderful  and  merciful  unto 
faithful  men:  Grant  thy  grace  from  on  high  unto  thy  servant  who  lieth  in 
sore  sickness,  O  Christ. 

O  Lord,  who  of  old  didst  show  forth  an  olive-branch  unto  the  abating 
of  the  Flood,  through  thy  divine  command:  Save  the  sufferer,  through 
thy  mercy

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  Graciously  look  down 
from  on  high,  O  Mother  of  the  Creator  of  all  men,  and  through  thy 
prayers  dispel  the  sufferer's  bitter  pangs. 

Sitting-Hymn  (Syedalen),  in  Tone  VIII.  Thou  who  art  like  a  river 
divine  of  mercy,  like  a  bottomless  gulf  of  great  loving-kindness,  O  Boun- 
tiful One;  Show  forth  the  god-like  streams  of  thy  mercy,  and  heal  all  men. 
Pour  forth  abundantly  floods  of  wonders,  and  wash  clean  all  men:  For 
resorting  ever  unto  thee,  we  fervently  implore  thy  grace.

Christ,  from  his  (her)  iniquities,  that  he  (she)  may  glorify  thy  might

Canticle  IV 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Church,  beholding  thee  uplifted  upon  the 
Cross,  OSun  of  Righteousness,  standeth  in  its  stateliness,  worthily  crying : 
Glory  to  thy  might,  O  Lord. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  O  Saviour,  who  like  unto  chrism  incorruptible  dost

bounty,  in  god-like  wise,  upon  the  bodily  wounds  of  him  (her)  who,  with 
faith,  is  now  about  to  receive  Unction. 

Forasmuch  as,  with  the  tranquillity  of  thy  mercy's  seal,  thou  hast  now 
signed  the  senses  of  thy  servant,  O  Master,  make  inaccessible,  impene- 
trable the  entrance  of  all  adverse  powers. 

Glory 

Thou  who  hast  commanded  the  ailing  to  summon  thine  inspired  minis-

holy  Oil  by  the  same :  Save  the  sufferer  by  thy  mercy,  O  thou  who  lovest

sake  of  mercy  flowed  from  thy  side. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind,  who  didst  institute 
anointment  for  kings  by  thy  words,  and  by  the  hands  of  High  Priests

Let  no  interposition  of  malignant  demons,  O  Saviour,  touch  the  senses

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  II.  O  Fountain  of  mercy,  who  art

grace  divine  from  on  high. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos) .  The  Abrahamic  Children  in  the  Persian  furnace, 
fired  rather  by  love  of  godliness  than  by  the  flame,  cried  aloud:  Blessed 
art  thou,  O  Lord,  in  the  tabernacle  of  thy  glory - 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Thou  who  in  thy  mercies  and  compassions,  O 
Saviour  and  only  God,  dost  heal  both  the  passions  of  the  soul  and  the 
bodily  afflictions  of  all  men:  Do  thou,  the  same  God,  restore  this  person 
who  suffereth  from  bodily  infirmities,  and  heal  thou  him  (her). 

When  the  heads  of  all  men  are  anointed  with  the  oil  of  Unction,  vouch- 
safe thou  the  joy  of  gladness  unto  this  person,  who  seeketh  the  mercy  of 
thy  redemption,  O  Christ,  bestowing  the  riches  of  thy  grace,  O  Lord. 

Glory 

Thy  seal  is  a  sword  against  demons,  O  Saviour,  a  fire  that  consumeth 
the  passions  of  the  soul,  through  the  prayers  of  priests.  Wherefore,  we 
who  have  received  healing,  in  faith,  do  sing  praises  unto  thee. 

Now,  and  ever,

assuage  the  pangs  of  this  sufferer,  we  beseech  thee. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Daniel  stretched  forth  his  hand,  and  stopped  the 
gaping  mouths  of  the  lions  in  the  pit.  And  the  Holy  Children,  zealous  in 
piety,  girding  themselves  with  virtue,  quenched  the  raging  fire,  as  they 
cried:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye  the  Lord. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Thou  showest  mercy  on  all  men,  O  Saviour,  be- 
cause of  thy  mercy  infinite  and  divine :  For  which  cause  all  we  have  assem- 
bled ourselves  together,  mystically  representing  the  worship  of  thy 
bounties,  and  have  brought  in  faith  the  anointing  with  the  holy  Oil  unto 
thy  servant:  whom  also  do  thou  visit. 

By  the  streams  of  thy  mercy,  O  Christ,  and  through  anointing  by  thy 
priests,  wash  away,  in  that  thou  art  full  of  loving-kindness,  O  Lord,  the 
pains  and  hurts,  and  the  sudden  assaults  of  suffering  of  him  (her)  who 
is  tormented  by  the  violence  of  passions;  that  he  (she)  may  glorify  thee 
with  thanksgiving,  in  that  he  (she)  hath  been  saved. 

Glory 

Forasmuch  as  thy  mercy  divine  hath  been  decreed  to  us  from  on  high, 
O  Master,  as  a  token  of  condescension  and  of  tranquillity :  Take  not  away 
thy  mercy,  neither  despise  thou  him  (her)  who,  with  faith,  continually 
doth  cry  unto  thee:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye  the  Lord. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  Nature  accepted  thy 
divine  birth-giving,  O  Pure  One,  as  a  crown  exceeding  glorious,  which

thee,  O  all-hymned  Lady 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Corner-stone  unhewn  by  hands  from  thee

thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Look  down  from  heaven,  O  Bountiful  One,  and

strength  unto  him  (her)  who  draweth  near  unto  thee  through  divine 
Unction  at  the  hands  of  thy  priests,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

O  Saviour  most  good,  rejoicing  have  we  beheld  the  Oil  divine,  which  by 
thy  condescension  inspired  thou  hast  received,  and  above  the  merits  of 
the  participants  hast  symbolically  imparted  unto  those  who  have  shared 
in  the  laver  divine.

servants:  Forasmuch  as  thou  art  a  merciful  Lord,  who  healest  by  thy 
grace  divine. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  As  thou  receivest  the 
songs  and  supplications  of  thy  servants,  O  Virgin,  so  also  deliver  thou 
from  irksome  ills  and  maladies,  him  (her)  who,  through  us,  fleeth  unto  thy 
divine  protection,  O  All-pure  One. 

For  meet  is  it,  in  truth,  to  bless  thee,  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  ever- 
blessed,  and  all-undefiled,  and  the  Mother  of  our  God.  More  honourable 
than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim, 
thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of 
God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Exapostildrion. 

In  mercy,  O  Good  One,  cast  thine  eyes  upon  the  petitions  of  us  who 
to-day  are  come  together  in  thy  holy  temple,  to  anoint  thy  sick  servant(^) 
with  thine  Oil  divine. 

Then  the  Stanzas  (Stikhiri),  in  Tone  IV  Thou  hast  given  thy  grace,  O 
thou  who  art  easy  to  be  entreated  and  lovest  mankind,  through  thine 
apostles,  by  thy  holy  Oil,  for  the  healing  of  the  wounds,  as  also  the  in- 
firmities of  all  men.  Have  mercy,  therefore,  upon  him  (her)  who  now, 
with  faith,  hath  recourse  unto  thine  Oil,  and  sanctify,  and  show  mercy, 
in  that  thou  art  of  tender  compassion.  Purge  him  (her)  from  every  ail- 
ment, and  vouchsafe  unto  him  (her)  thy  food  incorruptible,  O  Lord. 

Look  down  from  heaven,  O  Ineffable  One,  in  that  thou  art  of  tender 
loving-kindness,  who  with  thy  hand  invisible  hast  sealed  our  senses,  O 
thou  who  lovest  mankind,  upon  him  (her)  that,  through  thine  Oil  divine, 
in  faith  appealeth  unto  thee,  and  asketh  remission  of  his  (her)  transgres- 
sions. And  grant  healing  for  both  soul  and  body,  that  with  love  he  (she) 
may  glorify  thee,  magnifying  thy  sovereign  power. 

Through  anointing  with  thine  Oil,  and  the  touch  of  thy  priests,  O  thou 
who  lovest  mankind,  sanctify  thou  from  on  high  thy  servant.  Free  him 
(her)  from  his  (her)  infirmities.  Purge  away  his  (her)  spiritual  vileness. 
Wash  him  (her),  O  Saviour,  and  deliver  him  (her)  from  greatly  entan- 
gling temptations.  Assuage  his  (her)  maladies.  Banish  all  obstacles. 
Utterly  destroy  thou  all  his  (her)  afflictions;  forasmuch  as  thou  art  boun- 
tiful and  full  of  loving-kindness. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  O  most  pure  Palace  of 
the  King,  O  greatly  extolled  One,  purify,  I  implore  thee,  my  mind  which 
is  stained  with  all  manner  of  sin,  and  make  it  the  fair  abode  of  the  Trinity 
exceedingly  divine;  that,  being  saved,  I,  thine  unprofitable  servant,  may 
magnify  thy  power,  and  thy  boundless  mercy.

O  Christ,  manifest  thy  speedy  visitation  from  on  high  upon  thy  sick  ser-

Then  the  Deacon,  or  the  principal  Priest,  saith  the  following  Litany: 

In  peace,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy - 

For  the  peace  that  is  from  above,  and  for  the  salvation  of  our

For  the  peace  of  the  whole  world;  for  the  welfare  of  God's

That  he  will  deliver  him  (her)  and  us  from  all  tribulation,  wrath, 
and  necessity:   fy 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  ever- virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto

Choir    To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  principal  Priest  reciteth  the  Prayer  of  the  Oil  over  the  shrine-lamp. 
And  in  some  churches,  wine  is  poured  into  the  shrine-lamp ,  with  the  oil,  instead  of

Blind  of  my  spiritual  eyes,  I  come  unto 
thee,  O  Christ,  as  did  the  man  blind  from 
his  birth,  in  repentance  crying  unto  thee: 
Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  thou  who  illumin- 
est  with  exceeding  brightness  them  that  are 
in  darkness. 

Tone  III. 

By  thine  intercession  divine,  O  Lord,  raise 
thou  up  my  soul,  which  is  cruelly  paralyzed 
by  all  manner  of  sin,  and  by  unseemly  deeds, 
as  thou  aforetime  didst  raise  up  the  para- 
lytic; that,  being  saved,  I  may  cry  unto  thee: 
Grant  me  healing,  O  compassionate  Christ. 

Tone  II. 

As  a  disciple*  of  the  Lord,  O  Righteous 
One,  thou  didst  receive  the  Gospel;  as  a 
Martyr,  thou  hast  that  which  surpasseth 
utterance;  as  the  brother  of  God  thou  hast 
boldness;  as  a  hierarch,  thou  hast  power 
in  prayer.  Implore  thou  Christ  our  God 
that  he  will  save  our  souls. 


sanctify  this  Oil,  that 
it  may  be  effectual 
for  those  who  shall 
be  anointed  there- 
with, unto  healing, 
and  unto  relief  from 
every  passion,  every 
malady  of  the  flesh 
and  of  the  spirit,  and 
every  ill;  and  that 
therein  may  be  glori- 
fied thy  most  holy 
Name,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of 
the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

A  nd  the  other  Priests  also 
recite  the  same  Prayer, 
secretly,  with  him. 


Tone  IV 
The  Only-begotten  Word  of  God  the  Father,  who  in  these  latter  days 
hath  sojourned  among  us,  ordained  thee,  O  James  divine,  who  was 
sent  by  God,  to  be  the  first  shepherd  and  teacher  of  them  that  dwelt  in 
Jerusalem,  and  a  faithful  steward  of  spiritual  mysteries:  Wherefore,  O 
Apostle,  we  all  revere  thee. 

Tone  III. 
To  them  of  Mary,  O  Saint  f  thou  didst  reveal  thyself  as  a  minister  of 
Holy  Mysteries.  For  fulfilling  the  Gospel  of  Christ,  O  Venerable  One,  thou 
didst  lay  down  thy  life  for  thy  people,  and  didst  save  the  innocent 
from  death.  For  which  cause  thou  art  canonized  as  a  great  Initiate  in 
the  grace  of  God. 

Tone  III. 
The  world  hath  found  in  thee  a  champion  great  in  affliction,  O  En- 
durer  of  Pain,  who  didst  put  to  flight  the  heathen.  For  like  as  thou  didst 
humble  Lyeeus'  pride,  and  encourage  Nestor  in  his  striving  for  the 
prize,  even  so,  O  Saint  Demetrius,  pray  thou  unto  Christ  our  God,  that 
he  will  grant  unto  us  great  mercy.  (4)

O  sainted  Unmercenaries  and  Wonder-workers,  visit  ye  our  infirmities.

Thy  grandeur,  O  Chaste  One,*  who  shall  declare?  For  thou  aboundest

spoken  in  the  name  of  the  Lord,  for  an  example  of  suffering  affliction,  and 
of  patience.  Behold,  we  count  them  happy  which  endure.  Ye  have 
heard  of  the  patience  of  Job,  and  have  seen  the  end  of  the  Lord;  that  the 
Lord  is  very  pitiful,  and  of  tender  mercy  But  above  all  things,  my 
brethren,  swear  not,  neither  by  heaven,  neither  by  the  earth,  neither  by 
any  other  oath:  but  let  your  yea,  be  yea;  and  your  nay,  nay;  lest  ye  fall 
into  condemnation.  Is  any  among  you  afflicted?  let  him  pray.  Is  any 
merry?  let  him  sing  psalms.  Is  any  sick  among  you?  let  him  call  for 
the  elders  of  the  church ;  and  let  them  pray  over  him,  anointing  him  with 
oil  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord :  and  the  prayer  of  faith  shall  save  the  sick, 
and  the  Lord  shall  raise  him  up;  and  if  he  have  committed  sins,  they 
shall  be  forgiven  him.  Confess  your  faults  one  to  another,  and  pray  one 
for  another,  that  ye  may  be  healed.  The  effectual  fervent  prayer  of  a 
righteous  man  availeth  much.

The  Priest  then  readeth  the  Gospel.  (Luke  x.  25-38). 

And  behold,  a  certain  lawyer  stood  up,  and  tempted  him,  saying, 
Master,  what  shall  I  do  to  inherit  eternal  life?  He  said  unto  him,  What 
is  written  in  the  law?  how  readest  thou?  And  he  answering  said,  Thou 
shalt  love  the  Lord  thy  God  with  all  thy  heart,  and  with  all  thy  soul,  and 
with  all  thy  strength,  and  with  all  thy  mind ;  and  thy  neighbour  as  thyself. 
And  he  said  unto  him,  Thou  hast  answered  right:  this  do,  and  thou  shalt 
live.  But  he,  willing  to  justify  himself,  said  unto  Jesus,  And  who  is  my 
neighbour?  And  Jesus  answering,  said,  A  certain  man  went  down  from 
Jerusalem  to  Jericho,  and  fell  among  thieves,  which  stripped  him  of  his 
raiment,  and  wounded  him,  and  departed,  leaving  him  half  dead.  And 
by  chance  there  came  down  a  certain  priest  that  way;  and  when  he  saw 
him,  he  passed  by  on  the  other  side.  And  likewise  a  Levite,  when  he  was 
at  the  place,  came  and  looked  on  him,  and  passed  by  on  the  other  side. 
But  a  certain  Samaritan,  as  he  journeyed,  came  where  he  was:  and  when 
he  saw  him,  he  had  compassion  on  him,  and  went  to  him,  and  bound  up 
his  wounds,  pouring  in  oil  and  wine,  and  set  him  on  his  own  beast,  and 
brought  him  to  an  inn,  and  took  care  of  him.  And  on  the  morrow,  when 
he  departed,  he  took  out  two  pence,  and  gave  them  to  the  host,  and  said 
unto  him,  Take  care  of  him:  and  whatsoever  thou  spendest  more,  when  I 
come  again,  I  will  repay  thee.  Which  now  of  these  three,  thinkest  thou, 
was  neighbour  unto  him  that  fell  among  the  thieves?  And  he  said,  he 
that  showed  mercy  on  him.  Then  said  Jesus  unto  him,  Go,  and  do  thou 
likewise. 

Choir    Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  beseech 
thee;  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy     {Thrice.) 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  mercy,  peace,  life,  health,  salvation  and  re- 
mission of  sins  for  the  servant  of  God,  N     1$ 

That  he  (she)  may  be  pardoned  his  (her)  every  transgression,  whether 
voluntary  or  involuntary,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.    Ц 

Exclamation. 
Priest.  For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto

thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Prayer. 
Priest.  O  thou  who  art  without  beginning,  eternal,  the  Holy  of  Holies, 
who  didst  send  down  thine  Only- begotten  Son  to  heal  every  infirmity  and 
every  wound,  both  of  our  souls  and  bodies:  Send  down  thy  Holy  Spirit, 
and  sanctify  this  Oil;  and  cause  it  to  be  for  thy  servant,  N.,  who  is  about 
to  be  anointed  therewith,  unto  perfect  remission  of  his  (her)  sins,  and  unto 
inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

Some  say  this  Prayer  only  thus  far,  adding  here  the  Exclamation:  For  thy  property 
it  is  to  show  mercy  .       Others  recite  it  to  the  end. 

For  thou  art  a  great  and  marvellous  God,  who  keepest  thy  covenant 
and  thy  mercy  towards  them  that  love  thee ;  who  givest  remission  of  sins 
through  thy  Holy  Child,  Jesus  Christ;  who  regeneratest  us  from  sin  by 
holy  Baptism,  and  sanctifiest  us  with  thy  Holy  Spirit;  who  givest  light 
to  the  blind;  who  raisest  up  them  that  are  cast  down;  who  lovest  the 
righteous,  and  showest  mercy  unto  sinners ;  who  leadest  us  forth  again  out 
of  darkness  and  the  shadow  of  death,  and  sayest  unto  them  that  are  in 
captivity :  Come  forth ;  and  unto  them  that  sit  in  darkness :  Be  ye  unveiled. 
For  he  shined  in  our  hearts  with  the  light  of  the  knowledge  of  his  presence 
when,  for  our  sakes,  he  revealed  himself  upon  earth,  and  dwelt  among 
men;  and  unto  as  many  as  accepted  him,  to  them  gave  he  the  power  to 
become  the  sons  of  God,  vouchsafing  unto  us  the  adoption  of  sonship 
through  the  laver  of  regeneration,  and  causing  us  to  have  no  share  in  the 
assaults  of  the  Devil.  And  inasmuch  as  it  hath  not  pleased  thee  that  we 
should  be  cleansed  by  blood,  but  by  holy  Oil,  thou  didst  give  unto  us  the 
image  of  his  Cross,  that  we  might  become  the  flock  of  Christ,  a  royal 
priesthood,  a  holy  nation;  and  didst  purify  us  by  water,  and  sanctify  us 
by  thy  Holy  Spirit.  Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  O  Lord,  vouchsafe  unto 
us  grace  in  this  thy  ministry,  as  thou  didst  vouchsafe  it  unto  Moses,  thy 
servant,  who  found  favour  in  thy  sight;  and  unto  Samuel,  beloved  of 
thee;  and  unto  John,  thy  chosen  one;  and  unto  all  those  who,  from  gen- 
eration to  generation,  have  been  acceptable  unto  thee.  In  like  manner, 
make  us  also  to  be  ministers  of  the  new  Covenant  of  thy  Son  upon  this 
Oil,  which  thou  hast  acquired  unto  thyself  through  the  precious  blood  of 
thy  Christ;  that  putting  away  earthly  lusts,  we  may  die  unto  sin,  and  live 
unto  righteousness,  being  clothed  upon  with  him  through  the  anointing 
with  sanctification  of  this  Oil  which  we  are  about  to  summon  to  our  aid. 
Let  this  Oil,  O  Lord,  become  the  oil  of  gladness,  the  oil  of  sanctification, 
a  royal  robe,  an  armour  of  might,  the  averting  of  every  work  of  the  Devil, 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION  345 

the  seal  of  immunity  from  snares,  the  joy  of  the  heart,  an  eternal  rejoicing; 
that  they  who  shall  be  anointed  with  this  Oil  of  regeneration  may  be 
terrible  unto  their  adversaries,  and  may  shine  in  the  radiance  of  thy 
Saints,  having  neither  spot  nor  wrinkle ;  and  that  they  may  attain  unto 
thy  rest  everlasting,  and  receive  the  prize  of  their  high  calling. 

For  thy  property  it  is  to  show  mercy  and  to  save  us,  O  our  God;  and 
unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son, 
and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir    Amen. 

After  the  Prayer,  the  Priest  taketh  one  of  the  wands,  and  dippeth  it  in  the  holy  Oil, 
and  anointeth  the  sick  person,  in  cross-form;  on  the  brow,  the  nostrils,  the  cheeks, 
the  lips,  the  breast,  and  on  both  sides  of  the  hands,  repeating  the  while  this  Prayer: 

O  holy  Father,  Physician  of  souls  and  bodies,  who  didst  send  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  which  healeth  every  infirmity 
and  delivereth  from  death:  Heal  thou,  also,  thy  servant,  N.,  from  the  ills 
of  body  and  soul  which  do  hinder  him  {her),  and  quicken  him  {her),  by 
the  grace  of  thy  Christ;  through  the  prayers  of  our  most  holy  Lady,  the 
Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever- virgin  Mary;  through  the  intercession  of  the 
honourable  Bodiless  Powers  of  Heaven ;  through  the  might  of  the  precious 
and  life-giving  Cross ;  through  the  protection  of  the  honourable,  glorious 
Prophet,  Forerunner  and  Baptist,  John;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laud- 
able Apostles ;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  right- victorious  Martyrs;  of  our 
reverend  and  God-bearing  Fathers;  of  the  holy  and  healing  Unmercenaries, 
Cosmas  and  Damian,  Cyrus  and  John,  Panteleimon  and  Hermolaus, 
Samson  and  Diomedes,  Photius  and  Anicetas ;  of  the  holy  and  righteous 
Ancestors  of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna;  and  of  all  the  Saints. 

For  thou  art  the  Fountain  of  healing,  O  our  God,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thy  Spirit,  one 
in  essence,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

This  Prayer  is  said  by  each  of  the  Priests,  after  he  hath  read  the  Gospel  and  the 
accompanying  Prayer,  while  he  anointeth  the  person  with  the  Oil.

Deacon.  {Romans  xv.  1-8.)  Brethren,  we  then  that  are  strong  ought 
to  bear  the  infirmities  of  the  weak,  and  not  to  please  ourselves.  Let 
every  one  of  us  please  his  neighbour  for  his  good  to  edification.  For  even 
Christ  pleased  not  himself;  but,  as  it  is  written,  The  reproaches  of  them 
that  reproached  thee  fell  on  me.  For  whatsoever  things  were  written 
aforetime,  were  written  for  our  learning,  that  we  through  patience  and 
comfort  of  the  scriptures  might  have  hope.  Now  the  God  of  patience 
and  consolation  grant  you  to  be  like-minded  one  toward  another  accord- 
ing to  Christ  Jesus :  that  ye  may  with  one  mind  and  one  mouth  glorify 
God,  even  the  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  Wherefore  receive  ye 
one  another,  as  Christ  also  received  us,  to  the  glory  of  God.

The  Priest  then  readeth  the  Gospel  (Luke  xix.  i-n). 

Then  Jesus  entered  and  passed  through  Jericho.  And  behold,  there 
was  a  man  named  Zaccheus,  which  was  the  chief  among  the  publicans, 
and  he  was  rich.  And  he  sought  to  see  Jesus  who  he  was;  and  could  not 
for  the  press,  because  he  was  little  of  stature.  And  he  ran  before,  and 
climbed  up  into  a  sycamore-tree  to  see  him;  for  he  was  to  pass  that  way 
And  when  Jesus  came  to  the  place,  he  looked  up,  and  saw  him,  and  said 
unto  him,  Zaccheus,  make  haste,  and  come  down :  for  to-day  I  must  abide 
at  thy  house.  And  he  made  haste,  and  came  down,  and  received  him 
joyfully  And  when  they  saw  it,  they  all  murmured,  saying,  That  he  was 
gone  to  be  guest  with  a  man  that  is  a  sinner.  And  Zaccheus  stood,  and 
said  unto  the  Lord;  Behold,  Lord,  the  half  of  my  goods  I  give  to  the  poor; 
and  if  I  have  taken  any  thing  from  any  man  by  false  accusation,  I  restore 
him  fourfold.  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  This  day  is  salvation  come  to 
this  house,  forasmuch  as  he  also  is  a  son  of  Abraham.  For  the  Son  of 
man  is  come  to  seek  and  to  save  that  which  was  lost. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  straightway  reciteth  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,

THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION  347 

And  the  Second  Priest  saiih  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God  great  and  supreme,  who  art  adored  by  all  created  beings, 
Fountain  of  wisdom,  Abyss  of  goodness  in  very  truth  unfathomable,  and 
Sea  illimitable  of  loving-kindness:  do  thou,  the  same  Master  who  lovest 
mankind,  the  God  of  things  eternal  and  of  wonders,  to  the  understanding 
of  whom  none  among  men  by  taking  thought  can  attain,  look  down  and 
hear  us,  thine  unworthy  servants,  and  wheresoever  in  thy  great  Name  we 
shall  bring  this  Oil,  send  thou  down  the  gift  of  thy  healing,  and  remission 
of  sins:  and  heal  him  {her),  in  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies.  Yea,  O  Lord 
who  art  easy  to  be  entreated ;  who  alone  art  merciful  and  lovest  mankind ; 
who  repentest  thee  of  our  evil  deeds ;  who  knowest  how  that  the  mind  of 
man  is  applied  unto  wickedness,  even  from  his  youth  up;  who  desirest  not 
the  death  of  a  sinner,  but  rather  that  he  should  turn  again  and  live;  who 
for  the  salvation  of  sinners  didst  become  incarnate,  yet  still  remain  in 
God,  and  didst  thyself  become  a  created  being  for  the  sake  of  thy  crea- 
tures ;  thou  hast  said :  I  am  not  come  to  call  the  righteous  but  sinners 
to  repentance ;  thou  didst  seek  the  wandering  sheep ;  thou  didst  diligently 
seek  out  the  lost  piece  of  silver,  and  having  found  it,  thou  didst  say:  He 
that  cometh  unto  me  I  will  in  no  wise  cast  out ;  thou  didst  not  abhor  the 
sinful  woman  who  washed  thy  precious  feet  with  her  tears;  thou  didst 
say:  As  often  as  thou  fallest  arise,  and  thou  shalt  be  saved;  thou  art  he 
who  didst  say:  There  is  joy  in  heaven  over  one  sinner  who  repenteth. 
Do  thou,  O  tender-hearted  Master,  look  down  from  the  height  of  thy 
sanctuary,  overshadowing  us  sinners,  who  are  also  thine  unworthy 
servants,  with  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  at  this  hour,  and  take  up 
thine  abode  in  thy  servant,  N.,  who  acknowledgeth  his  {her)  iniquities, 
and  draweth  near  unto  thee  in  faith;  and  accepting  him  {her)  because  of 
thy  love  towards  mankind,  forgiving  him  {her)  whatsoever  he  {she)  hath 
done  amiss,  whether  by  word,  or  deed,  or  thought,  forgive  him  {her), 
cleanse  him  {her),  make  him  {her)  pure  from  every  sin;  and  abiding  ever 
present  with  him  {her),  preserve  him  {her)  all  the  remaining  years  of  his 
{her)  life;  that,  walking  ever  in  thy  statutes,  he  {she)  may  in  no  wise 
again  become  an  object  of  malignant  joy  to  the  Devil;  and  thy  holy 
Name  may  be  glorified  in  him  {her). 

For  thy  property  it  is  to  show  mercy  and  to  save  us,  O  Christ-God;  and 
unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from  ever- 
lasting, and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  straightway  after  this  Prayer,  the  Second  Priest  taketh  the  second  wand,  and 
dipping  it  in  the  holy  Oil,  he  anointeth  the  sick  person,  reciting  the  while  the 
Prayer:  O  holy  Father,  Physician  of  souls  and  bodies,  .  .  .  {See  page  345.)

Deacon,  (i  Cor.  xii.  27-xiii.  1-8.)  Brethren,  now  ye  are  the  body  of 
Christ,  and  members  in  particular.  And  God  hath  set  some  in  the  church, 
first  apostles,  secondarily  prophets,  thirdly  teachers,  after  that  miracles, 
then  gifts  of  healings,  helps,  governments,  diversities  of  tongues.  Are  all 
apostles?  are  all  prophets?  are  all  teachers?  are  all  workers  of  miracles? 
Have  all  the  gifts  of  healing?  do  all  speak  with  tongues?  do  all  interpret? 
But  covet  earnestly  the  best  gifts.  And  yet  shew  I  unto  you  a  more  ex- 
cellent way.  Though  I  speak  with  the  tongues  of  men  and  of  angels,  and 
have  not  charity,  I  am  become  as  sounding  brass,  or  a  tinkling  cymbal. 
And  though  I  have  the  gift  of  prophecy,  and  understand  all  mysteries, 
and  all  knowledge;  and  though  I  have  all  faith,  so  that  I  could  remove 
mountains,  and  have  not  charity,  I  am  nothing.  And  though  I  bestow 
all  my  goods  to  feed  the  poor,  and  though  I  give  my  body  to  be  burned, 
and  have  not  charity,  it  profiteth  me  nothing.  Charity  suffereth  long, 
and  is  kind ;  charity  envieth  not ;  charity  vaunteth  not  itself,  is  not  puffed 
up,  doth  not  behave  itself  unseemly,  seeketh  not  her  own,  is  not  easily 
provoked,  thinketh  no  evil.  Rejoiceth  not  in  iniquity,  but  rejoiceth  in 
the  truth;  beareth  all  things,  believeth  all  things,  hopeth  all  things,  en- 
dureth  all  things.     Charity  never  faileth.

And  when  Jesus  had  called  unto  him  his  twelve  disciples,  he  gave  them 
power  against  unclean  spirits,  to  cast  them  out,  and  to  heal  all  manner 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION  349 

of  sickness,  and  all  manner  of  disease.  These  twelve  Jesus  sent  forth, 
and  commanded  them,  saying,  Go  not  into  the  way  of  the  Gentiles,  and 
into  any  city  of  the  Samaritans  enter  ye  not.  But  go  rather  to  the  lost 
sheep  of  the  house  of  Israel.  And  as  ye  go,  preach,  saying,  The  kingdom 
of  heaven  is  at  hand.  Heal  the  sick,  cleanse  the  lepers,  raise  the  dead, 
cast  out  devils:  freely  ye  have  received,  freely  give. 
Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

And  straightway  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  OGod,  .  .

The  Third  Priest  then  saith  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Master  Almighty,  O  holy  King,  who  chastenest  and  yet  slayest  not; 
who  raisest  up  them  that  fall,  and  restorest  them  that  are  cast  down;  who 
relievest  the  bodily  afflictions  of  men:  We  beseech  thee,  O  our  God,  that 
thou  wilt  direct  thy  mercy  upon  this  Oil,  and  upon  all  who  shall  be 
anointed  therewith  in  thy  Name;  that  it  may  be  effectual  unto  the  heal- 
ing of  their  souls  and  bodies,  and  unto  cleansing,  and  unto  the  putting 
away  of  every  infirmity,  and  disease,  and  malady,  and  every  defilement, 
both  of  body  and  spirit.  Yea,  Lord,  send  down  from  heaven  thy  healing 
might;  touch  the  bodies;  quench  the  fever:  soothe  the  pangs,  and  banish 
every  hidden  ailment.  Be  thou  the  physician  of  thy  servant,  N  Raise 
him  {her)  up  from  his  {her)  bed  of  sickness,  and  from  his  (her)  couch  of 
suffering,  and  from  his  (her)  bed  of  wasting  disease,  whole  and  perfectly 
restored  to  health,  vouchsafing  unto  him  (her),  through  thy  Church, 
those  things  which  are  well-pleasing  unto  thee,  and  which  work  thy  will. 
For  thy  property  it  is  to  show  mercy  and  to  save  us,  O  our  God;  and 
unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the

The  Fourth  Priest  readeth  the  Gospel  (Matt.  viii.  14-24). 

And  when  Jesus  was  come  into  Peter's  house,  he  saw  his  wife's  mother 
laid,  and  sick  of  a  fever  And  he  touched  her  hand,  and  the  fever  left  her: 
and  she  arose,  and  ministered  unto  them.  When  the  even  was  come,  they 
brought  unto  him  many  that  were  possessed  with  devils :  and  he  cast  out 
the  spirits  with  his  word,  and  healed  all  that  were  sick;  that  it  might  be 
fulfilled  which  was  spoken  by  Esaias  the  prophet,  saying,  Himself  took  our 
infirmities  and  bare  our  sicknesses.  Now  when  Jesus  saw  great  multi- 
tudes about  him,  he  gave  commandment  to  depart  unto  the  other  side. 
And  a  certain  scribe  came,  and  said  unto  him,  Master,  I  will  follow  thee 
whithersoever  thou  goest.  And  Jesus  saith  unto  him,  The  foxes  have 
holes,  and  the  birds  of  the  air  have  nests;  but  the  Son  of  man  hath  not 
where  to  lay  his  head.  And  another  of  his  disciples  said  unto  him,  Lord, 
suffer  me  first  to  go  and  bury  my  father.  But  Jesus  said  unto  him, 
follow  me;  and  let  the  dead  bury  their  dead.  And  when  he  was  entered 
into  a  ship,  his  disciples  followed  him.

ciful, plentiful  in  mercy,  and  rich  in  beneficence,  the  Father  of  bounties 
and  God  of  all  comfort,  who  through  thy  holy  Apostles  hast  empowered

him  (her)  every  ailment  and  weakness;  that,  being  raised  up  by  thy 
mighty  hand,  he  (she)  may  serve  thee  with  all  thanksgiving;  and  that  we 
also,  who  now  do  share  thine  inexpressible  love  towards  mankind,  may

The  Priest.  {Matt.  xxv.  1-14.)  The  Lord  spake  this  parable:  Then  shall 
the  kingdom  of  heaven  be  likened  unto  ten  virgins,  which  took  their  lamps, 
and  went  forth  to  meet  the  bridegroom.  And  five  of  them  were  wise,  and 
five  were  foolish.  They  that  were  foolish  took  their  lamps,  and  took  no 
oil  with  them:  but  the  wise  took  oil  in  their  vessels  with  their  lamps. 
While  the  bridegroom  tarried,  they  all  slumbered  and  slept.  And  at  mid- 
night there  was  a  cry  made,  Behold,  the  bridegroom  cometh ;  go  ye  out  to 
meet  him.  Then  all  those  virgins  arose,  and  trimmed  their  lamps.  And 
the  foolish  said  unto  the  wise,  Give  us  of  your  oil:  for  our  lamps  are  gone 
out.  But  the  wise  answered,  saying,  Not  so;  lest  there  be  not  enough  for 
us  and  you:  but  go  ye  rather  to  them  that  sell,  and  buy  for  yourselves. 
And  while  they  went  to  buy,  the  bridegroom  came;  and  they  that  were 
ready,  went  in  with  him  to  the  marriage:  and  the  door  was  shut.  After- 
ward came  also  the  other  virgins,  saying,  Lord,  Lord,  open  unto  us.  But 
he  answered  and  said,  Verily,  I  say  unto  you,  I  know  you  not.  Watch 
therefore,  for  ye  know  neither  the  day  nor  the  hour  wherein  the  Son  of 
man  cometh.

And  the  Fifth  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer: '

beggar  from  the  earth,  and  exaltest  the  poor  man  from  the  dunghill;  O 
Father  of  orphans,  and  Haven  of  the  tempest- tossed,  and  Physician  of  the 
ailing,  who  painlessly  didst  bear  our  weaknesses,  and  accept  our  infirmities ; 
who  showest  mercy  with  gentleness,  and  passest  over  our  wickedness,  and 
takest  away  our  unrighteousness ;  who  art  quick  to  help,  and  slow  to  wrath ; 
who  didst  breathe  upon  thy  disciples  and  say :  Receive  ye  the  Holy  Spirit : 
whosesoever  sins  ye  remit,  they  are  remitted  unto  them ;  who  acceptest  the 
contrition  of  sinners,  and  hast  power  to  pardon  sins  manifold  and  grievous, 
and  bestowest  healing  upon  all  who  continue  in  weakness  and  long-endur- 
ing sickness;  who  hast  called  me,  also,  thy  humble,  and  sinful,  and  unwor- 
thy servant,  entangled  in  manifold  sins,  and  wallowing  in  the  lusts  of 
pleasures,  to  the  holy  and  exceeding  lofty  degree  of  the  Priesthood,  and  to 
enter  in  within  the  innermost  veil,  into  the  Holy  of  Holies,  whither  also 
the  holy  Angels  desire  to  penetrate,  and  to  hear  the  voice  of  the  Lord  God

which  announceth  glad  tidings,  and  to  behold  with  mine  eyes  the  pres- 
ence of  the  sacred  Oblation,  and  to  take  delight  in  the  divine  and  sacred 
Liturgy:  Thou  who  graciously  enablest  me  to  administer,  as  a  priest,  thy 
heavenly  Mysteries,  and  to  offer  unto  thee  gifts  and  sacrifices  for  our  sins, 
and  for  the  ignorances  of  thy  people,  and  to  act  as  a  mediator  for  thy 
speech-endowed  sheep,  that  thou,  through  thy  great  and  unspeakable 
love  towards  mankind,  mayest  cleanse  them  from  their  iniquities:  Do 
thou,  the  same  exceeding  good  King,  give  ear  unto  my  prayer  in  this  same 
hour  and  holy  day,  and  at  every  time  and  place,  and  receive  the  voice  of 
my  supplication,  and  vouchsafe  healing  unto  thy  servant,  N.,  who  is  weak 
both  in  soul  and  in  body,  granting  unto  him  (her)  remission  of  his  (her) 
sins,  and  pardon  of  his  (her)  transgressions,  both  voluntary  and  involun- 
tary. Heal  thou  his  (her)  incurable  wounds,  and  every  ailment,  and 
every  malady.  Give  health  to  his  (her)  soul,  O  thou  who  didst  touch  the 
mother-in-law  of  Peter,  whereupon  the  fever  left  her,  and  she  arose,  and 
ministered  unto  thee.  Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  grant  healing  also  to 
thy  servant,  N.,  and  alleviation  of  every  hurtful  illness;  and  call  to  mind 
thy  rich  bounties  and  thy  mercy  Call  to  mind  how  perpetually  the 
mind  of  man  inclineth  unto  evil,  even  from  his  youth  up,  and  that  not  so 
much  as  one  sinless  man  is  to  be  found  upon  the  earth ;  for  thou  alone  art 
without  sin,  who  didst  come  down  and  save  the  human  race,  and  free  us 
from  bondage  to  the  enemy.  For  if  thou  wilt  enter  into  judgment  with 
thy  servants,  none  shall  be  found  pure  from  stain,  but  every  mouth  shall 
be  sealed,  having  nought  to  answer  in  extenuation;  for  like  unto  cast-off 
rags  is  all  our  righteousness  in  thy  presence.  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  re- 
member thou  not  the  sins  of  our  youth :  For  thou  art  the  hope  of  the  hope- 
less, and  the  rest  of  those  who  labour  and  are  heavy-laden  with  iniquity. 
And  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from 
everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.

ance :  against  such  there  is  no  law.  And  they  that  are  Christ's  have  cru-

The  Sixth  Priest  then  readeth  the  Gospel  (Matt.  xiv.  21-29). 

Then  Jesus  went  thence,  and  departed  into  the  coasts  of  Tyre  and 
Sidon.  And  behold,  a  woman  of  Canaan  came  out  of  the  same  coasts, 
and  cried  unto  him,  saying,  Have  mercy  on  me,  O  Lord,  thou  son  of  David ; 
my  daughter  is  grievously  vexed  with  a  devil.  But  he  answered  her  not  a 
word.  And  his  disciples  came  and  besought  him,  saying,  Send  her  away; 
for  she  crieth  after  us.  But  he  answered  and  said,  I  am  not  sent  but 
unto  the  lost  sheep  of  the  house  of  Israel.  Then  came  she  and  worshipped 
him,  saying,  Lord,  help  me.  But  he  answered  and  said,  It  is  not  meet  to 
take  the  children's  bread  and  to  cast  it  to  dogs.  And  she  said,  Truth, 
Lord,  yet  the  dogs  eat  of  the  crumbs  which  fall  from  their  masters'  table. 
Then  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  her,  O  woman,  great  is  thy  faith:  be 
it  unto  thee  even  as  thou  wilt.  And  her  daughter  was  made  whole  from 
that  very  hour.

And  the  Sixth  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

We  thank  thee,  O  Lord  our  God,  who  art  good  and  lovest  mankind,  the 
Physician  of  our  souls  and  bodies,  who  painlessly  hast  borne  our  infirm- 
ities, by  whose  stripes  we  have  all  been  healed,  thou  good  Shepherd,  who 
didst  come  to  seek  the  wandering  sheep;  who  givest  consolation  to  the 
faint-hearted,  and  life  unto  those  who  are  broken  of  heart;  who  didst  heal 
the  flow  of  the  woman  who  had  had  an  issue  of  blood  twelve  years ;  who 
didst  free  the  daughter  of  the  Canaanitish  woman  from  the  cruel  demon ; 
who  forgavest  their  debt  unto  the  two  debtors,  and  didst  grant  remission 
of  sins  unto  the  woman  that  was  a  sinner;  who  didst  vouchsafe  healing 
unto  the  Paralytic,  and  likewise  the  remission  of  his  sins;  who  didst  jus- 
tify the  Publican  by  thy  word,  and  didst  accept  the  Thief  at  his  last  con- 
fession; who  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  world,  and  wast  nailed  to  the 
Cross:  We  beseech  thee,  and  entreat  thee,  in  thy  goodness  loose,  remit, 
forgive,  O  God,  the  errors  of  thy  servant,  N.,  and  his  (her)  iniquities, 
whether  voluntary  or  involuntary,  whether  of  knowledge  or  of  ignorance, 
whether  of  excess  or  of  disobedience,  whether  of  the  night  or  of  the  day; 
whether  he  (she)  be  under  the  ban  of  a  priest,  or  the  curse  of  father  or 
mother;  whether  through  the  sight  of  his  (her)  eyes,  or  his  (her)  sense  of 
smell;  whether  through  the  union  of  adultery  or  the  taste  of  fornication, 
or  through  whatsoever  impulse  of  the  flesh  and  of  the  spirit  he  (she)  hath 
departed  from  thy  will,  and  from  thy  holiness.  If  we,  also,  have  sinned 
in  like  manner,  forgive;  forasmuch  as  thou  art  a  good  God  who  remember- 
est  not  evil,  and  lovest  mankind :  and  let  not  him  (her)  or  us  fall  into  evil- 
ness  of  life,  neither  run  in  hurtful  ways.  Yea,  O  Master,  Lord,  hearken 
unto  me,  a  sinner,  in  this  hour,  on  behalf  of  thy  servant,  N.,  and  overlook 
all  his  (her)  trespasses,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  a  God  who  rememberest 
not  evil.  Free  him  (her)  from  torment  eternal;  fill  his  (her)  mouth  with 
thy  praise;  open  his  (her)  lips  that  he  (she)  may  glorify  thy  holy  Name; 
stretch  forth  his  (her)  hand  to  the  performance  of  thy  statutes.  Guide 
his  (her)  feet  aright  in  the  way  of  thy  Gospel,  strengthening  all  his  (her) 
members  and  his  (her)  thoughts,  by  thy  grace.  For  thou  art  our  God, 
who  hast  given  us  a  commandment  by  thy  holy  Apostles,  saying:  What- 
soever ye  bind  on  earth  shall  be  bound  in  heaven,  and  whatsoever  ye 
loose  on  earth  shall  be  loosed  in  heaven.  And  again:  Unto  whomsoever 
ye  remit  sins,  unto  him  they  shall  be  remitted,  and  if  ye  retain  them,  they 
shall  be  retained.  And  as  thou  didst  hearken  unto  Ezekiel  in  the  sorrow 
of  his  soul,  at  the  hour  of  his  death,  and  didst  not  despise  his  supplica- 
tions, so  also,  in  like  manner,  give  ear  unto  me,  thy  humble,  and  sinful, 
and  unworthy  servant  at  this  hour.  For  thou  art  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
who  didst  command  us  to  forgive  the  erring  their  sins,  even  unto  seventy 
times  seven,  through  thy  goodness,  and  love  towards  mankind,  and  who 
repentest  thee  of  our  wickedness,  and  rejoicest  over  the  return  of  those 
who  have  gone  astray.     For  as  is  thy  majesty,  so  also  is  thy  mercy,  and

unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from  ever-

The  Seventh  Priest  then  readeth  the  Gospel  (Matt.  ix.  9-14). 

And  as  Jesus  passed  forth  from  thence,  he  saw  a  man  named  Matthew, 

sitting  at  the  receipt  of  custom:  and  he  saith  unto  him,  Follow  me.     And 

he  arose,  and  followed  him.     And  it  came  to  pass,  as  Jesus  sat  at  meat  in 

the  house,  behold,  many  publicans  and  sinners  came  and  sat  down  with 


THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION  357 

him  and  his  disciples.  And  when  the  Pharisees  saw  it,  they  said  unto  his 
disciples,  Why  eateth  your  Master  with  publicans  and  sinners?  But 
when  Jesus  heard  that,  he  said  unto  them,  They  that  be  whole  need 
not  a  physician,  but  they  that  are  sick.  But  go  ye  and  learn  what  that 
meaneth,  I  will  have  mercy,  and  not  sacrifice:  for  I  am  not  come  to  call 
the  righteous,  but  sinners  to  repentance. 
Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,       .  O  God,  and  the  Excla- 
mation.    (See  page  343.) 

And  the  Seventh  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  thou  art  the  Physician  of  souls  and  bodies, 
who  assuagest  temporal  sufferings  and  healest  every  infirmity  and  every 
wound  of  men;  who  desirest  that  all  men  should  be  saved,  and  should 
come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  truth;  who  desirest  not  the  death  of  a 
sinner,  but  that  he  should  turn  him  again  and  live:  for  thou,  O  Lord,  in 
the  ancient  Covenant,  didst  ordain  repentance  unto  sinners,  unto  David 
and  the  Ninevites,  and  unto  those  who  went  before  them,  and  likewise, 
at  the  advent  of  thy  dispensation  in  the  flesh,  thou  calledst  not  the 
righteous  but  sinners  to  repentance;  who  didst  accept  in  repentance  the 
Publican,  the  Woman  who  was  a  sinner,  and  the  Thief,  and  great  Paul  the 
blaspheming  Persecutor;  and  who  didst  accept  in  repentance  great  Peter, 
thy  chief  Apostle,  who  also  thrice  denied  thee ;  and  gavest  unto  him  a  prom- 
ise, saying:  Thou  art  Peter,  and  on  this  rock  will  I  build  my  Church,  and  the 
gates  of  Hell  shall  not  prevail  against  it;  and  I  will  give  thee  the  keys  of 
the  kingdom  of  heaven.  For  which  cause,  O  Good  One,  who  lovest  man- 
kind, we  also  have  boldness,  according  to  thy  faithful  promise,  and  we 
beseech  thee,  and  implore  thee,  at  this  present  hour:  Give  ear  unto  our 
supplication,  and  receive  it  as  incense  offered  unto  thee;  and  visit  thy 
servant,  N.;  and  if  he  (she)  hath  done  aught  amiss,  either  by  word,  or 
deed,  or  thought,  either  by  night  or  by  day;  if  he  (she)  hath  fallen  under 
the  ban  of  a  priest,  or  under  his  (her)  own  anathema;  or  hath  been  em- 
bittered by  an  oath,  and  hath  cursed  himself  (herself):  We  beseech  thee, 
and  supplicate  thee:  loose,  pardon,  forgive  him  (her),  O  God,  overlook- 
ing his  (her)  sins  and  wickednesses,  both  those  which  he  (she)  hath  done 
knowingly,  and  those  which  he  (she)  hath  committed  in  ignorance.  And 
if  he  (she)  hath  transgressed  thy  commandments,  or  hath  sinned  because 
he  (she)  beareth  flesh,  and  dwelleth  in  the  world,  or  through  the  wiles  of 
the  Devil,  do  thou,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  a  good  God  and  lovest  man- 
kind, forgive;  for  there  is  no  man  who  liveth  and  sinneth  not.  For  thou 
only  art  sinless,  thy  righteousness  is  righteousness  to  all  eternity,  and  thy 
word  is  truth.  Because  thou  hast  not  created  man  for  destruction,  but 
for  the  keeping  of  thy  commandments,  and  for  the  inheritance  of  life  in- 
corruptible ;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  the  Father, 
and  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


358  THE  OFFICE  OF  HOLY  UNCTION 

And  after  this  Prayer,  the  Seventh  Priest  taketh  the  seventh  wand,  and  dipping  it  in 
the  holy  Oil,  he  anointeth  therewith  the  sick  person,  reciting  the  while  the  Prayer: 
0  holy  Father,  Physician  of  souls  and  bodies,  .  .  .  with  the  Exclamation.  (See 
page  345.) 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  Anointing,  the  sick  person,  if  he  be  able,  shall  himself  go 
among  the  Priests;  or,  supported  by  his  own  people,  he  shall  stand  or  sit  among 
them. 

But  if  he  be  not  able,  the  Priests  shall  gather  about  him,  as  he  licth  on  his  couch. 
And  the  principal  Priest,  taking  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  opening  it, 
shall  lay  it,  with  the  writing  down,  on  the  head  of  the  sick  person,  the  book  being 
held  by  all  the  Priests. 
And  the  principal  Priest  doth  not  lay  on  his  hand,  but  reciteth,  aloud,  this  Prayer:  (7) 
O  holy  King,  compassionate  and  all-merciful  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  Son 
and  Word  of  the  living  God,  who  desirest  not  the  death  of  a  sinner,  but 
rather  that  he  should  turn  from  his  wickedness  and  live:  I  lay  not  my 
sinful  hand  upon  the  head  of  him  (her)  who  is  come  unto  thee  in  ini- 
quities, and  asketh  of  thee,  through  us,  the  pardon  of  his  (her)  sins,  but 
thy  strong  and  mighty  hand,  which  is  in  this,  thy  Holy  Gospels,  that  is 
now  held   by  my  fellow-ministers,  upon   the   head  of  thy  servant,  N. 
And  with  them  I,  also,  beseech  and  entreat  thy  merciful  compassion  and 
love  of  mankind,  which  cherisheth  .no  remembrance  of  evil,  O  God  our 
Saviour,  who  by  the  hand  of  thy  prophet  Nathan  didst  give  remission  of 
his  sins  unto  penitent  David,  and  didst  accept  Manasses'  prayer  of  con- 
trition: Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  receive  also  with  thy  wonted  tender 
love  towards  mankind,  this  thy  servant,  N.,  who  repentethfhim  (her)  of 
his  (her)  sore  transgressions,  regarding  not  all  his  (her)  trespasses.     For 
thou  art  our  God,  who  hast  commanded  that  we  forgive,  even  unto  sev- 
enty times  seven,  those  who  fall  into  sin.     For  as  is  thy  majesty,  so  also  is 
thy  mercy :  and  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  from  the  head  of  the  sick  person,  they  give  it 
to  him  to  kiss. 

And  the  Deacon  straightway  reciteth  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,

have  given  you  power  over  unclean  spirits,  to  cast  them  out,  and  to  heal 
every  infirmity,  and  every  malady.  Wherefore,  as  ye  have  nobly  lived, 
according  to  his  commandments,  freely  ye  have  received,  and  freely  do

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  in  the  same  Tone.  Regard  the 
prayers  of  thy  servants,  O  All-undefiled  One,  who  quenchest  the  fierce 
attacks  upon  us,  giving  us  release  from  every  adversity:  for  thee  alone 
have  we  as  a  support  firm  and  assured,  and  have  acquired  thy  protection, 
O  Lady;  and  all  we  who  call  upon  thee  shall  not  be  put  to  confusion. 
Make  haste  to  the  petitions  of  those  who  with  faith  cry  unto  thee: 
Hail,  O  Lady!  O  Help  of  all  men!  O  Joy  and  Refuge,  and  Salvation  of 
our  souls ! 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Bless. 

And  the  Benediction. 

May  Christ  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  pure 
Mother;  by  the  might  of  the  precious  and  life-giving  Cross;  of  the  holy, 
glorious  and  all-laudable  James,  the  Apostle  and  the  first  Bishop  of 
Jerusalem,  the  brother  of  God;  and  of  all  the  Saints;  save  us  and  have 
mercy  upon  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good,  and  loveth  mankind. 

And  the  Person  who  hath  received  Unction  with  Prayer  maketh  a  reverence,  saying: 
Bless  me,  holy  Fathers.     Pardon  me,  a  sinner.     (Thrice.) 

And  having  received  their  blessing  and  pardon,  he  goeth  thence,  giving  thanks  unto 
God. 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  PARTING  OF  THE  SOUL 
FROM  THE  BODY 

The  Abbot  cometh  to  a  monk,  or  his  Father  Confessor  to  a  layman,  and  inquireth 
if  there  be  any  word  or  deed  which  hath  been  forgotten,  or  baseness,  or  any  wrath 
against  any  brother,  which  hath  remained  unconfessed,  or  is  unforgiven;  he  must 
search  all  there  is,  and  interrogate  the  dying  man  concerning  each  one. 

Then  the  Priest  beginneth: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.)     Glory     .     now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Twelve  times.) 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 
down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  (Three  rever- 
ences.) 

Psalm  li. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me  throughly 
from  my  wickedness,  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I  acknowledge 
my  faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned, 
and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justified  in  thy  say- 
ing and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold  I  was  shapen  in  wickedness, 
and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou  requirest  truth 
in  the  inward  parts,  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand  wisdom  secretly. 
Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean;  thou  shalt  wash 
me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow.     Thou  shalt  make  me  hear  of  joy

and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may  rejoice.  Turn 
thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds.  Make  me  a  clean 
heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast  me  not  away 
from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy  Holy  Spirit  from  me.  O  give  me  the 
comfort  of  thy  help  again,  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free  Spirit.  Then 
shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked,  and  sinners  shall  be  converted  unto 
thee.  Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou  that  art  the  God  of 
my  health;  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  Thou  shalt 
open  my  lips,  O  Lord,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy  praise.  For  thou 
desirest  no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou  delightest  not  in 
burnt-offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled  spirit:  a  broken  and 
contrite  heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be  favourable  and  gra- 
cious unto  Zion:  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem.  Then  shalt  thou  be 
pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with  the  burnt-offerings  and 
oblations:  then  shall  they  offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine  altar. 

A  Canon  of  Prayer  to  the  All-undefiled  Birth-giver  of  God,  wiih  Theme-Songs 
(Irmosi)  in  the  Sixth  Tone,  on  behalf  of  a  man  whose  soul  is  departing,  and  who 
cannot  speak. 

Canticle  I. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos) .  When  Israel  passed  on  foot  over  the  deep,  as  it 
had  been  dry  land,  and  beheld  their  pursuer  Pharaoh  engulfed  in  the  sea, 
they  cried  aloud :  Let  us  sing  unto  God  a  song  of  victory. 

Refrain.  O  all-holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  save  us.* 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Like  drops  of  rain  my  evil  days  and  few,  dried  up 
by  summer's  heat,  already  gently  vanish :  O  Lady,  save  me. 

Through  thy  tenderness  of  heart  and  thy  many  bounties,  by  nature 
inclined  thereto,  O  Lady,  in  this  dread  hour  intercede  for  me,  O  Helper 
Invincible! 

Great  terror  now  imprisoneth  my  soul,  trembling  unutterable  and 
grievous,  when  forth  from  the  body  it  must  go:  Comfort  thou  it,  O  All- 
undefiled  One. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

O  Refuge  renowned  for  the  sinful  and  contrite,  make  thy  mercy  known 
upon  me,  O  Pure  One,  and  deliver  me  from  the  hands  of  demons:  For 
many  dogs  have  compassed  me  about. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lo,  now  is  the  hour  for  succour,  lo,  now  the  hour  for  thine  intercession; 
lo,  now,  the  time  because  of  which,  day  and  night  I  have  bowed  down 
before  thee,  and  prayed  fervently  unto  thee,  O  Lady. 

Canticle  III. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  There  is  none  holy  like  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  my 
God,  who  hast  exalted  the  horn  of  thy  faithful,  O  Good  One,  and  hast 
established  us  upon  the  rock  of  thy  confession.

Зб2    OFFICE  AT  THE  PARTING  OF  THE  SOUL  FROM  THE  BODY 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Inasmuch  as  I  foresaw  this  day  from  afar,  O  Lady, 
meditating  ever  upon  it  as  though  it  were  come,  with  hot  tears  I  have 
prayed  unto  thee  that  thou  wouldst  not  forget  me. 

The  assembly  of  the  crafty,  gaping,  have  compassed  me  round  about, 
and  seek  to  bear  me  away  and  bitterly  torment  me.  Crush  thou  their 
teeth  and  jaws  and  save  me,  O  Pure  One. 

For  as  an  organ  of  speech  I  am  altogether  extinguished,  and  my  tongue 
is  bound,  and  mine  eye  closeth.  In  contrition  of  heart  I  entreat  thee: 
O  my  Deliverer,  save  me. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Incline  thine  ear  unto  me,  O  Mother  of  Christ  my  God,  from  the  height 
of  thy  great  glory,  O  Good  One;  and  hear  my  last  groan,  and  give  me  thy 
hand. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Turn  not  from  me  thy  many  bounties ;  shut  not  the  bowels  of  thy  love 
toward  mankind,  O  Pure  One:  but  intercede  for  me  now,  and  in  the  hour 
of  judgment  remember  thou  me. 

Canticle  IV. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Christ  is  my  strength,  my  God'  and  my  Lord, 
the  august  Church  doth  sing  in  God-befitting  wise,  crying  aloud  and  out  of 
a  pure  mind  keeping  festival  unto  the  Lord. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Appoint  thou  now  a  washing  for  sin,  a  stream  of 
tears,  O  Good  One,  receiving  the  contrition  of  my  heart.  In  thee  have  I 
set  my  hope,  O  Good  One,  when  thou  deliverest  me  from  frightful  fiery 
torment;  forasmuch  as  thou  art  the  Fountain  of  Grace,  O  Birth-giver  of 
God. 

O  Refuge  which  maketh  not  ashamed,  and  infallible  unto  all  who  are 
in  need,  Lady  all-undefiled,  be  thou  my  defender  in  the  hour  of  trial. 

Stretch  forth,  O  All-pure  One,  thine  all-honourable  hands,  like  unto 
the  wings  of  a  holy  dove,  under  whose  protection  and  shelter  cover  thou 
me,  O  Lady. 

Glory. 

O  Conqueror  and  Tormentor  of  the  fierce  Prince  of  the  air,  O  Guardian 
of  the  dread  path,  and  Searcher  of  these  vain  words,  help  thou  me  to  pass 
over  unhindered,  as  I  depart  from  earth. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  . 

Lo,  terror  is  come  to  meet  me,  O  Lady,  and  I  fear  it ;  lo,  a  great  ordeal 
hath  seized  hold  upon  me,  wherein  be  thou  my  helper,  O  thou  Hope  of  my 
salvation. 

Canticle  V- 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  With  thy  light  divine,  O  Good  One,  illumine 
thou,  I  pray  thee,  the  souls  of  those  who  wake  early  unto  thee  with  love: 
that  they  may  know  thee,  O  Word  of  God,  of  the  true  God,  who  callest 
forth  from  the  gloom  of  sin. 


OFFICE  AT  THE  PARTING  OF  THE  SOUL  FROM  THE  BODY    363 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Forget  me  not,  O  Good  One,  neither  turn  thou  away 
thy  face  from  me,  thy  child;  but  hear  me,  for  I  am  in  trouble;  and  receive 
thou  my  soul,  and  deliver  it. 

Ye  who  are  my  kinsfolk  in  the  flesh,  and  ye  who  are  my  brethren  in  the 
spirit,  my  friends  and  wonted  acquaintance,  weep  ye,  sigh,  wail:  For  lo, 
now  am  I  departing  from  you. 

No  one  now  delivereth,  and,  of  a  truth,  there  is  none  to  aid.  Succour 
thou  me,  O  Lady;  else  as  a  helpless  man  shall  I  be  captive  in  the  hands  of 
mine  enemies. 

Glory  .  .  . 

Having  entered,  O  ye  my  holy  Angels,  as  ye  stand  before  the  Judg- 
ment Seat  of  Christ,  bending  in  thought  your  supersensual  knees,  cry  ye 
with  weeping  unto  him:  Have  mercy,  O  Maker  of  all  men,  upon  the  work 
of  thy  hands,  O  Good  One;  and  cast  it  not  away. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Bowing  down  before  the  Sovereign  Lady  and  all-pure  Mother  of  my 
God,  pray  ye  that  she  will  bend  her  knees  together  with  you;  and  she 
shall  bend  Him  to  mercy:  For  the  true  Mother  and  Nourisher  will  be 

heard. 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Forasmuch  as  I  behold  the  sea  of  life  surging 
high  with  the  tempest  of  temptations,  I  have  fled  to  thy  tranquil  haven 
and  cry  aloud  unto  thee:  Lead  thou  my  life  forth  from  corruption,  O 
Most  Merciful  One. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  My  mouth  is  silent,  and  my  tongue  speaketh  not, 
but  my  heart  maketh  utterance:  For  that  fire  of  contrition  which  in- 
wardly devoureth  is  kindled,  and  in  tones  inexpressible  invoketh  thee, 
O  Virgin. 

Look  down  upon  me  from  on  high,  O  Mother  of  God,  and  mercifully 
hearken  now  to  my  supplication ;  that  having  beheld  thee  I  may  go  forth 
from  the  body  rejoicing. 

The  destruction  of  ties,  and  the  overthrow  of  nature's  laws  of  union, 
and  of  the  whole  corporeal  structure,  cause  me  anguish  and  distress 
intolerable. 

Glory  .  .  . 

To  the  holy  and  honourable  arms  of  the  holy  Angels  transfer  me,  O 
Lady ;  that  covered  with  their  wings  I  behold  not  the  ignominious  and  re- 
volting and  glocmy  forms  of  devils. 

Now,  and  ever,  . 

O  All-honourable  Abode  of  God,  grant  unto  me  the  heavenly,  the 
supersensual  abode,  after  that  thou  hast  kindled  my  expiring  and  un- 
radiant  light  by  the  holy  oil  of  thy  mercy. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  VI. 

Arise,  O  my  soul,  O  my  soul  why  sleepest  thou?    The  end  draweth  near,

and  thou  must  speak.     Arise,  therefore,  from  thy  sleep,  and  Christ  cur 
God,  who  is  in  all  places  and  filleth  all  things,  shall  spare  thee. 

Ikos. 
The  Devil,  when  he  beheld  the  healing  of  Christ  thrown  open,  and  the 
health  which  flowed  therefrom  unto  Adam,  being  sore  smitten  as  it  were 
with  a  calamity,  wailed  and  cried  unto  his  friends :  What  shall  I  do  unto 
the  Son  of  Mary?  The  Bethlehemite,  who  is  in  all  places  and  filleth  all 
things,  doth  slay  me. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song  ilrmos) .  An  Angel  made  the  fiery  furnace  to  drop  dew  for 
the  Holy  Children,  but  the  command  of  God,  consuming  the  Chaldaeans 
with  fire,  prevailed  upon  the  tormentor  to  cry  aloud :  Blessed  art  thou,  O 
God  of  our  fathers ! 

Hymns  (Tropari).  The  night  of  death,  gloomy  and  moonless,  hath 
overtaken  me,  still  unready,  sending  me  forth  on  that  long  and  dreadful 
journey  unprepared.     But  let  thy  mercy  accompany  me,  O  Lady. 

Lo,  all  my  days  are  vanished,  of  a  truth,  in  vanity,  as  it  is  written,  and 
my  years  also  in  vain;  and  now  the  snares  of  death,  which  of  a  truth  are 
bitter,  have  entangled  my  soul,  and  have  compassed  me  round  about. 

Let  not  the  multitude  of  my  sins  conquer  thy  great  tenderness  of  heart, 
O  Lady.  But  let  thy  mercy  compass  me  round  about,  and  let  it  cover 
all  my  transgressions. 

Glory  .  . 

They  who  shall  lead  me  hence  are  come,  and  hem  me  in  on  every  side; 
but  my  soul  holdeth  back  and  is  dismayed,  being  filled  with  much  rebel- 
lion; the  which  allay  thou,  O  Pure  One,  by  thy  manifestation. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Not  one  have  I  found  who  grieveth  over  my  affliction,  or  who  comfort- 
eth  me,  O  Lady:  For  all  my  friends  and  acquaintance  have  now  aban- 
doned me.     But  do  thou,  O  my  Hope,  in  no  wise  forsake  me. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos) .  Out  of  the  flames  thou  didst  shed  forth  dew  upon 
the  Godly  Ones,  and  with  water  didst  kindle  the  sacrifice  of  the  Righteous 
One.  For  thou  doest  all  things  which  thou  wiliest,  O  Christ.  Thee  will 
we  exalt  unto  all  the  ages. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  As  the  Mother  loving  mankind  of  the  God  who 
loveth  mankind,  look  thou  with  calm  and  merciful  eye  when  my  soul 
from  its  body  shall  part;  and  I  will  glorify  thee  forever,  O  holy  Birth- 
giver  of  God. 

Vouchsafe  that  I  may  escape  the  hordes  of  bodiless  barbarians,  and 
rise  through  the  abysses  of  the  air,  and  enter  into  heaven;  and  I  will 
glorify  thee  forever,  O  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

O  thou  who  didst  bear  the  Lord  Almighty,  banish  thou  far  from  me

when  I  come  to  die,  the  chieftain  of  bitter  torments  who  ruleth  the  uni- 
verse; and  I  will  glorify  thee  forever,  O  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Glory  . 

When  the  last  great  trump  shall  sound  unto  the  frightful  and  dread 
Resurrection  of  the  Judgment  Day,  and  all  shall  rise  from  the  dead ;  then 
remember  thou  me,  O  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Now,  and  ever,     .  . 

O  lofty  Palace  of  Christ  our  Master,  who  hast  sent  down  thy  grace 
from  on  high,  aid  thou  me  now,  in  the  day  of  wrath;  and  I  will  glorify 
thee  forever,  O  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  It  is  not  possible  that  men  should  see  God,  upon 
whom  the  Orders  of  the  Angels  dare  not  gaze:  but  through  thee,  O  All- 
pure  One,  was  the  Word  Incarnate  manifested  unto  men ;  Whom  magni- 
fying, together  with  the  Heavenly  Hosts,  we  call  thee  blessed. 

Hymns  (Tropari).  Oh,  how  shall  I  look  upon  the  invisible?  How  shall 
I  endure  its  vision  dread?  How  shall  I  dare  mine  eyes  to  open?  How 
shall  I  dare  to  gaze  upon  my  Master,  whom  I  have  not  ceased,  from  my 
youth  up,  ever  to  grieve? 

O  Holy  Maiden,  Birth-giver  of  God,  look  with  mercy  upon  my  meekness. 
Receive  this  my  propitiatory  and  final  prayer,  and  from  the  fire  that 
tortureth  to  all  eternity  make  thou  haste  to  deliver  me. 

I,  who  have  defiled  the  holy  temples,  on  quitting  this  vile  temple  of  the 
body,  do  beseech  thee,  O  all-honourable  Temple  of  God,  Maiden,  Virgin 
Mother,  that  my  soul  may  escape  outer  darkness,  and  the  burning  of 
fierce  Gehenna. 

Glory 

Forasmuch  as  I  now  behold  the  end  of  my  life  draw  near,  and  am  a 
worker  of  unseemly  thoughts  and  deeds,  O  All-pure  One,  I  am  cruelly 
smitten  with  the  stings  of  conscience,  O  Maker  of  my  soul.  But  do  thou 
mercifully  incline  unto  me;  and  be  thou  my  Intercessor. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

The  Son  will  give  himself  unto  us  for  mercy,  the  Son  of  God  and  King 
of  the  Angels,  the  Man  Eternal,  coming  forth  from  thy  pure  blood ;  Whom 
do  thou  propitiate,  O  Maiden,  on  behalf  of  my  passion-tossed  soul,  which 
is  cruelly  wrested  from  my  body  accursed. 

Meet  is  it,  in  truth,  to  bless  thee,  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  ever-blessed 
and  all-undefiled,  and  the  Mother  of  our  God.  More  honourable  than  the 
Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou 
who  without  defilement  barest  God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God, 
we  magnify  thee. 

The  Prayers  said  by  the  Priest  at  the  Departure  of  a  Soul. 

O  Lord  God  Almighty,  the  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  wiliest 
that  all  men  should  be  saved,  and  should  come  unto  the  knowledge  of  the 


366    OFFICE  AT  THE  PARTING  OF  THE  SOUL  FROM  THE  BODY 

truth;  who  desirest  not  the  death  of  a  sinner,  but  that  he  should  turn 
again  and  live:  We  pray  thee  and  implore  thee,  absolve  thou  the  soul  of 
thy  servant,  N.,  from  every  bond,  and  deliver  him  (her)  from  every  curse. 
Pardon  his  (her)  transgressions,  both  of  knowledge  and  of  ignorance,  both 
of  deed  and  of  word,  which  he  (she)  hath  committed  from  his  (her)  youth 
up,  and  hath  cleanly  confessed  or  hath  concealed,  either  through  forget- 
fulness  or  through  shame.  For  thou  alone  loosest  those  things  which  are 
bound,  and  guidest  aright  the  contrite,  and  art  the  hope  of  the  despairing, 
and  mighty  to  remit  the  sins  of  every  man  who  putteth  his  trust  in  thee. 
Yea,  O  Lord  who  lovest  mankind,  give  thou  command,  and  he  shall  be  re- 
leased from  the  bonds  of  the  flesh  and  of  sin ;  and  receive  thou  in  peace  the 
soul  of  this  thy  servant,  N.,  and  give  it  rest  in  the  everlasting  mansions, 
with  thy  Saints;  through  the  grace  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord, 
and  God,  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ:  with  whom  also  thou  art  blessed,  to- 
gether with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Or:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God  Almighty,  who  wiliest  that  all  men  should 
be  saved  and  should  come  to  a  knowledge  of  the  truth ;  who  desirest  not 
the  death  of  a  sinner,  but  that  he  should  turn  again  and  be  saved :  We  pray 
thee  and  beseech  thee,  deliver  thou  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  N.,  from  every 
bond,  free  it  from  every  curse.  For  thou  art  he  who  delivereth  them  that 
are  bound,  and  guideth  aright  them  that  are  cast  down,  O  Hope  of  the 
hopeless.  Wherefore,  O  Master,  command  that  the  soul  of  thy  servant, 
N.,  may  depart  in  peace,  and  may  rest  in  thine  everlasting  mansions  with 
all  thy  Saints;  through  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  thou  art 
blessed,  together  with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Another  Prayer  for  a  Person  who  hath  suffered  long,  and  is  on  the  point  of  death. 

O  Lord- our  God,  who  in  thine  ineffable  wisdom  hast  created  man,  fash- 
ioning him  out  of  the  dust,  and  adorning  him  with  comeliness  and  good- 
ness, as  an  honourable  and  heavenly  acquisition,  to  the  exaltation  and 
magnificence  of  thy  glory  and  kingdom,  that  thou  mightest  bring  him 
into  this  image  and  likeness;  but  forasmuch  as  he  sinned  against  the  com- 
mand of  thy  statute,  having  accepted  the  image  but  preserved  it  not,  and 
because,  also,  evil  shall  not  be  eternal:  Thou  hast  ordained  remission  unto 
the  same,  through  thy  love  toward  mankind;  and  that  this  destructible 
bond,  which  as  the  God  of  our  fathers  thou  hadst  sanctified  by  thy  divine 
will,  should  be  dissolved,  and  that  his  body  should  be  dissolved  from  the 
elements  of  which  it  was  fashioned,  but  that  his  soul  should  be  translated 
to  that  place  where  it  shall  take  up  its  abode  until  the  final  Resurrection. 
Therefore  we  pray  unto  thee,  the  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  im- 
mortal, and  unto  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  unto  thine  all-holy  Spirit, 


OFFICE  AT  THE  PARTING  OF  THE  SOUL  FROM  THE  BODY    367 

that  thou  wilt  deliver  N.  from  the  body  unto  repose,  entreating,  also, 
forgiveness  of  thine  ineffable  goodness  if  he  {she)  in  any  wise,  whether  of 
knowledge  or  in  ignorance,  hath  offended  thy  goodness,  or  is  under  the 
ban  of  a  priest,  or  hath  embittered  his  {her)  parents,  or  hath  broken  a  vow, 
or  hath  fallen  into  devilish  imaginations  and  shameful  sorceries,  through 
the  malice  of  the  crafty  demon:  Yea,  O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  hearken 
unto  me  a  sinner  and  thine  unworthy  servant  in  this  hour,  and  deliver  thy 
servant,  N.,  from  this  intolerable  sickness  which  holdeth  him  {her)  in 
bitter  impotency,  and  give  him  {her)  rest  where  the  souls  of  the  righteous 
dwell.  For  thou  art  the  repose  of  our  souls  and  of  our  bodies,  and  unto

THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD 

(LAYMEN)  (i)* 

When  an  Orthodox  believer  dieth,  his  relatives  straightway  give  notice  thereof  unto  the 
Priest,  who,  when  he  is  come  to  the  house  in  which  the  remains  of  the  dead  man  lie, 
and  hath  put  on  his  priestly  stole  (epitrakhit) ,  and  hath  placed  incense  in  the  censer, 
censeth  the  body  of  the  dead,  and  those  present;  and  beginneth  as  usual: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Amen. 

And  those  who  stand  there  begin: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.    (Thrice.)     Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

And  immediately  the  following  Hymns  (Тгорагг),  in  Tone  IV.,  are  sung: 

With  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dead  give  rest,  O  Saviour,  to  the  soul  of 
thy  servant,  preserving  it  unto  the  life  of  blessedness  which  is  with  thee, 
O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

In  the  place  of  thy  rest,  O  Lord,  where  all  thy  Saints  repose,  give  rest 
also  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant;  for  thou  only  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  .  .  . 

Thou  art  the  God  who  descended  into  Hell,  and  loosed  the  bonds  of  the 
captives.     Do  thou  give  rest  also  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

O  Virgin  alone  Pure  and  Undefiled,  who  without  seed  didst  bring  forth 
God,  pray  thou  that  his  (her)  soul  may  be  saved.

And  the  Priest,  meanwhile,  saith,  se- 
cretly, the  following  Prayer: 

O  God  of  spirits,  and  of  all 
flesh,  who  hast  trampled  down 
Death,  and  overthrown  the  Devil, 
and  given  life  unto  thy  world: 
Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  give 
rest  to  the  soul  of  thy  departed 
servant,  N.,  in  a  place  of  bright- 
ness, a  place  of  verdure,  a  place 
of  repose,  whence  all  sickness, 
sorrow  and  sighing  have  fled 
away.  Pardon  every  transgres- 
sion which  he  (she)  hath  com- 
mitted, whether  by  word,  or  deed, 
or  thought.  For  thou  art  a  good 
God,  and  lovest  mankind;  be- 
cause there  is  no  man  who  liveth 
and  sinneth  not:  for  thou  only 
art  without  sin,  and  thy  righteous- 
ness is  to  all  eternity,  and  thy 
word  is  true.

370  THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN) 
And  if  all  things  are  now  ready  for  the  departure,  the  Priest  beginneth  again: 
Blessed  is  our  God  .  .  .  (See  page  368.) 

And  we  begin  to  sing,  with  all  awe  and  emotion:  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  (2) 
(See  page  368.) 

And  taking  up  the  mortal  remains  of  the  departed,  we  come,  bearing  tapers,  unto  the 
Church,  preceded  by  the  Priest,  and  by  the  Deacon  with  the  censer.  And  when  we 
come  to  the  Church,  the  remains  are  deposited  in  the  porch  (or  in  the  Church,  as  is 
the  custom  in  Russia).     And  the  beginning  is: 

Psalm  xci. 

Whoso  dwelleth  under  the  defence  of  the  Most  High,  shall  abide  under 
the  shadow  of  the  Almighty.  I  will  say  unto  the  Lord,  Thou  art  my  hope, 
and  my  stronghold ;  my  God,  in  him  will  I  trust.  For  he  shall  deliver  thee 
from  the  snare  of  the  hunter,  and  from  the  noisome  pestilence.  He  shall 
defend  thee  under  his  wings,  and  thou  shalt  be  safe  under  his  feathers; 
his  faithfulness  and  truth  shall  be  thy  shield  and  buckler.  Thou  shalt 
not  be  afraid  for  any  terror  by  night,  nor  for  the  arrow  that  flieth  by 
day;  for  the  pestilence  that  walketh  in  darkness,  nor  for  the  sickness  that 
destroyeth  in  the  noon-day.  A  thousand  shall  fall  beside  thee,  and  ten 
thousand  at  thy  right  hand ;  but  it  shall  not  come  nigh  thee.  Yea,  with 
thine  eyes  shalt  thou  behold,  and  see  the  reward  of  the  ungodly.  For 
thou,  Lord,  art  my  hope;  thou  hast  set  thine  house  of  defence  very  high. 
There  shall  no  evil  happen  unto  thee,  neither  shall  any  plague  come  nigh 
thy  dwelling.  For  he  shall  give  his  angels  charge  over  thee,  to  keep  thee 
in  all  thy  ways.  They  shall  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  that  thou  hurt  not 
thy  foot  against  a  stone.  Thou  shalt  go  upon  the  lion  and  adder:  the 
young  lion  and  the  dragon  shalt  thou  tread  under  thy  feet.  Because  he 
hath  set  his  love  upon  me,  therefore  will  I  deliver  him ;  I  will  set  him  up, 
because  he  hath  known  my  Name.  He  shall  call  upon  me,  and  I  will 
hear  him;  yea,  I  am  with  him  in  trouble;  I  will  deliver  him,  and  bring  him 
to  honour      With  long  life  will  I  satisfy  him,  and  show  him  my  salvation. 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord:  teach  me  thy  statutes. 

Then  the  first  portion  of  Psalm  cxix.  is  chanted,  in  Tone  VI.:  Blessed  are  those 
that  are  undefiled  in  the  way,  and  walk  in  the  law  of  the  Lord. 

Psalm  cxix.* 

Blessed  are  those  that  are  undefiled  in  the  way,  and  walk  in  the  law  of 

the  Lord.  B; 

Refrain.  Alleluia. 

Blessed  are  they  that  keep  his  testimonies,  and  seek  him  with  their 

whole  heart.  B; 

For  they  who  do  no  wickedness,  walk  in  his  ways.  B, 
Thou  hast  charged  that  we  shall  diligently  keep  thy  commandments.  B, 
O  that  my  ways  were  made  so  direct,  that  I  might  keep  thy  statutes!  B^

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  after  thy  great  goodness;  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  mercies  do  away  mine  offences.  Wash  me  throughly 
from  my  wickedness,  and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin.  For  I  acknowledge 
my  faults,  and  my  sin  is  ever  before  me.  Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned, 
and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight;  that  thou  mightest  be  justified  in  thy 
saying,  and  clear  when  thou  art  judged.  Behold,  I  was  shapen  in  wicked- 
ness, and  in  sin  hath  my  mother  conceived  me.  But  lo,  thou  requirest 
truth  in  the  inward  parts,  and  shalt  make  me  to  understand  wisdom 
secretly.  Thou  shalt  purge  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean;  thou 
shalt  wash  me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow  Thou  shalt  make  me 
hear  of  joy  and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which  thou  hast  broken  may 
rejoice.  Turn  thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put  out  all  my  misdeeds. 
Make  me  a  clean  heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right  spirit  within  me.  Cast 
me  not  away  from  thy  presence,  and  take  not  thy  Holy  Spirit  from  me. 
O  give  me  the  comfort  of  thy  help  again,  and  stablish  me  with  thy  free 
Spirit.  Then  shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the  wicked,  and  sinners  shall 
be  converted  unto  thee.  Deliver  me  from  blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou 
that  art  the  God  of  my  health ;  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteous- 
ness. Thou  shalt  open  my  lips,  O  Lord,  and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy 
praise.  For  thou  desirest  no  sacrifice,  else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou 
delightest  not  in  burnt-offerings.  The  sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled 
spirit:  a  broken  and  contrite  heart,  O  God,  shalt  thou  not  despise. 

O  be  favourable  and  gracious  unto  Zion :  build  thou  the  walls  of  Jerusa- 
lem. Then  shalt  thou  be  pleased  with  the  sacrifice  of  righteousness,  with 
the  burnt-offerings  and  oblation:  then  shall  they  offer  young  bullocks

much as  thou  art  of  tender  compassion:  and  didst  seek,  and  find,  and 
save. 

Glory  .  . . 

Mercifully  vouchsafe,  O  Good  One,  that  he  (she)  who  from  the  transi- 
tory, unstable  things  of  corruption  hath  passed  over  unto  thee,  may  dwell 
with  joy  in  the  heavenly  mansions,  O  God,  being  justified  by  faith  and  by 
grace. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

There  is  none  undefiled,  like  unto  thee,  O  most  pure  Mother  of  God : 
for  thou  alone,  in  all  the  ages,  hast  conceived  in  thy  womb  the  true  God, 
who  hath  shattered  the  power  of  Death.

Sitting-Hymn  (Syeddlen),  in  Tone  VI. 

Of  a  truth,  all  things  are  vanity,  and  life  is  but  a  shadow  and  a  dream. 

For  in  vain  doth  every  one  who  is  born  of  earth  disquiet  himself,  as  saith 

the  Scriptures.     When  we  have  acquired  the  world,  then  do  we  take  up

Wherefore,  O  Christ  our  God,  give  rest  to  thy  servant  departed  this  life; 
forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

O  all-holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  forsake  me  not  all  the  days  of  my  life,

thyself  succour  me,  and  show  mercy  upon  me.

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Christ  is  my  strength,  my  God,  and  my  Lord, 
the  august  Church  doth  sing  in  God-befitting  wise,  crying  aloud,  and 
out  of  a  pure  mind  keeping  festival  unto  the  Lord. 

Hymns.  In  that  thou  didst  reveal  a  great  token  of  wisdom,  and  through 
the  abundance  of  gifts  the  fulness  of  perfection  of  thy  goodness,  O  August 
Master,  thou  didst  unite  the  company  of  the  Martyrs  unto  the  Angels. 

Mercifully  enable  him  (her)  who  hath  now  appeared  before  thee  to 
obtain  thy  glory  unspeakable,  O  Christ,  where  is  the  abode  of  those  who 
rejoice,  and  the  voice  of  gladness  pure. 

Glory     .  . 

Him  (her)  who  singeth  thy  majesty  divine;  him  (her)  whom  thou  hast 
taken  away  from  earth,  receive  thou,  making  him  (her)  a  child  of  the 
light,  and  cleansing  him  (her)  from  the  gloom  of  sin,  O  exceeding-merciful 
One.

O  Receptacle  most  pure,  O  Temple  all-undefiled,  O  Ark  all-holy,   O

of  Jacob. 

Canticle  V. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  With  thy  light  divine,  O  Good  One,  illumine 
thou,  through  love,  I  pray  thee,  the  souls  of  those  who  wake  early  unto 
thee:  that  they  may  know  thee,  O  Word  of  God,  of  the  true  God,  who 
callest  forth  from  the  gloom  of  sin. 

Hymns.  The  Martyrs,  in  that  they  offered  themselves  unto  God  all- 
glorified,  as  it  were  a  saered  whole  burnt-offering  and  the  first-fruits  of  the 
human  race,  perpetually  intercede  for  our  salvation. 

To  the  faithful  member  of  thy  household  who  hath  fallen  asleep  before 
us,  vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  a  heavenly  abiding-place,  a  meed  of  thy  gifts, 
granting  unto  him  (her)  redemption  from  his  (her)  sins.

He  who  was  born  in  the  world  of  thee,  O  Lady,  is  become  the  strength,

Hell  those  who,  with  faith,  do  call  thee  blessed. 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song  ilrmos).  Forasmuch  as  I  behold  the  sea  of  life  surging 
high  with  the  tempest  of  temptations,  I  have  fled  to  thy  tranquil  haven 
and  cry  aloud  unto  thee:  Lead  thou  my  life  forth  from  corruption,  O 
Most  Merciful  One. 

Hymns.  When  thou  wast  nailed  to  the  Cross,  thou  didst  gather  unto 
thyself  the  company  of  the  Martyrs  who  imitated  thy  Passion,  O  Blessed 
One.  We  beseech  thee,  therefore:  Give  rest  unto  him  {her)  who  hath 
now  been  translated  to  thy  presence. 

When  thou  shalt  come  terribly,  in  thy  glory  ineffable  in  the  clouds, 
to  judge  the  whole  world,  graciously  enable  him  {her)  whom  thou  hast 
taken  from  the  earth,  thy  faithful  servant,  to  meet  thee,  the  Redeemer, 
in  brightness. 

Glory 

O  Lord,  who  art  the  Fountain  of  life  through  thy  manhood  divine; 
who  settest  at  liberty  them  that  are  bound:  establish  thou  in  the  bliss 
of  Paradise  thy  servant  who,  in  faith,  hath  departed  unto  thee.

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

We  have  returned  back  to  the  earth  because  we  have  sinned  against

ascended  from  earth  unto  heaven,  shaking  off  the  corruption  of  death.

For  earth  thou  art,  and  unto  the  earth  shalt  thou  return.  Whither,  also,

Canticle  Vll. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  An  Angel  made  the  fiery  furnace  to  drop  dew 
for  the  Holy  Children,  but  the  command  of  God  consuming  the  Chal- 
deans with  fire  prevailed  upon  the  tormentor  to  cry  aloud:  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 

Hymns.  Thy  Martyrs,  redeemed  by  thy  blood  from  the  primal  trans- 
gression, were  stained  with  their  own  blood,  and  plainly  image  forth  thy 
sacrifice.     Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 

Thou  didst  slay  Death  the  insolent,  O  Life-originating  Word.  Accept 
thou  now  him  (her)  who  now  hath  fallen  asleep  and  with  faith  doth  glorify 
thee,  and  doth  say,  O  Christ:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 

Glory 

O  Master,  most  truly  God,  who  hast  animated  me,  a  man,  with  thy 
breath  divine,  graciously  grant  thou  unto  the  dead  thy  kingdom,  that  he 
(she)  may  sing  unto  thee,  O  Saviour:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our 
fathers.

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Thou  wast  made  more  excellent  than  every  created  being,  O  All-unde- 
filed  One,  when  thou  didst  conceive  God,  who  destroyed  the  gates  of 
Death,  and  burst  the  bars.  For  which  cause,  we  faithful  do  magnify 
thee  in  songs  as  the  Mother  of  God,  O  Pure  One. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Out  of  the  flames  thou  didst  shed  forth  dew 
upon  the  Godly  Ones,  and  with  water  didst  kindle  the  sacrifices  of  the 
Righteous  One.  For  thou  ddest  all  things  which  thou  wiliest,  O  Christ. 
Thee  will  we  exalt  unto  all  the  ages. 

Hymns.  When  ye  were  shown  as  having  steadfastly  contended  for 
the  prize,  ye  Martyrs  of  Christ,  as  conquerors  were  ye  adorned  with  the 
crown  of  victory,  crying:  We  exalt  thee,  O  Christ,  unto  all  the  ages. 

Those  who  have  continued  faithful  in  godly  living,  and  now  are  trans- 
lated unto  thee,  do  thou  accept,  O  Master.  Graciously  give  rest,  foras- 
much as  thou  art  of  tender  compassion,  unto  those  who  exalt  thee  unto 
all  the  ages. 

Glory  .  .  . 

Graciously  vouchsafe,  O  Saviour,  to  establish  now  in  the  land  of  the 
meek  all  those  who  have  fallen  asleep  before  us,  who  having  been  justified 
through  faith  in  thee  and  through  grace  exalt  thee  unto  all  the  ages.

the  Word,  Who  in  very  truth  is  blessed;  Who,  for  our  sake,  became  flesh; 
Whom  also  we  will  exalt  unto  all  the  ages. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  It  is  not  possible  that  men  should  see  God,  upon 
whom  the  Orders  of  the  Angels  dare  not  gaze.  But  through  thee,  O  All- 
pure  One,  was  the  Word  Incarnate  manifested  unto  men :  whom  magnify- 
ing, together  with  the  Heavenly  Hosts,  we  call  thee  blessed. 

Hymns.  Hope  made  strong  the  company  of  the  Martyrs,  and  incited 
them  ardently  toward  thy  love,  thereby  foreshadowing  the  future  rest, 
which,  in  very  truth,  cannot  be  shaken:  Unto  which,  O  Good  One,  grant 
that  he  (she)  may  attain  who  hath  been  taken  hence. 

Graciously  vouchsafe,  O  Christ,  that  he  (she)  who  hath  departed  in 
the  faith  may  receive  of  thy  dazzling  radiance  divine;  granting  unto  him 
(her)  rest  in  Abraham's  bosom;  forasmuch  as  thou  only  art  merciful;  and 
vouchsafing  unto  him  (her)  blessedness  eternal.

lated him  (her)  from  this  place  of  affliction  and  the  shadow  of  death:  In 
that  place  where  thy  light  shineth  establish  thou  him  (her).

We  know  thee,  O  Pure  One,  that  thou  art  the  holy  Tabernacle,  and

tion given  unto  those  who  are  justified  by  the  blood  of  him  who  was  made 
flesh  through  thy  womb,  O  All-undefiled  One.

(And  the  rest,  while  the  Priest  saith  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  .  .     See  page  369.) 
Then  the  Anthem,  by  John,  the  Monk  of  Damascus,  is  begun: 

Tone  I.  What  earthly  sweetness  remaineth  unmixed  with  grief? 
What  glory  standeth  immutable  on  earth  ?  All  things  are  but  shadows 
most  feeble,  but  most  deluding  dreams:  yet  one  moment  only,  and  Death 
shall  supplant  them  all.  But  in  the  light  of  thy  countenance,  O  Christ, 
and  in  the  sweetness  of  thy  beauty,  give  rest  unto  him  (her)  whom  thou 
hast  chosen:  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Tone  II.  Woe  is  me!  What  manner  of  ordeal  doth  the  soul  endure 
when  from  the  body  it  is  parted!  Woe  is  me!  how  many  then  are  its 
tears;  and  there  is  none  to  show  compassion!  It  turneth  its  eyes  to  the 
Angels;  all  unavailing  is  its  prayer.  It  stretcheth  out  its  hands  to  men; 
and  findeth  none  to  succour.  Wherefore,  my  brethren  beloved,  meditat- 
ing on  the  brevity  of  our  life,  let  us  beseech  of  Christ  rest  for  him  (her) 
who  hath  departed  hence :  and  for  our  souls  great  mercy. 


386    THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN) 

Tone  III  All  mortal  things  are  vanity  and  exist  not  after  death. 
Riches  endure  not,  neither  doth  glory  accompany  on  the  way :  for  when 
death  cometh,  all  these  things  vanish  utterly.  For  which  cause  let  us  cry 
unto  Christ  the  immortal:  Give  rest,  in  the  abode  of  those  who  are  glad, 
to  the  dead  translated  from  among  us. 

Tone  IV.  Where  is  earthly  predilection?  Where  is  the  pomp  of  the 
ephemeral  creatures  of  a  day  ?  Where  are  the  gold  and  the  silver?  Where 
is  the  multitude  of  household  servants  and  their  clamour?  All  dust,  all 
ashes,  all  shadows.  But  come,  let  us  cry  aloud  unto  the  deathless  King: 
O  Lord,  of  thine  eternal  good  things  vouchsafe  thou  unto  him  {her)  who 
hath  been  translated  from  among  us,  giving  unto  him  (her)  rest  in  thy 
blessedness  which  waxeth  not  old. 

Tone  V  I  called  to  mind  the  Prophet,  how  he  cried:  I  am  earth  and 
ashes;  and  I  looked  again  into  the  graves,  and  beheld  the  bones  laid  bare; 
and  I  said :  Who  then  is  the  king  or  the  warrior,  the  rich  man  or  the  needy, 
the  upright  or  the  sinner?  Yet  give  rest  with  thy  Saints  unto  thy  servant, 
O  Lord. 

Tone  VI.  Thy  creating  command  was  my  origin  and  my  foundation: 
for  thy  pleasure  it  was  out  of  nature  visible  and  invisible  to  fashion  me,  a 
living  creature.  From  the  earth  thou  didst  shape  my  body,  and  didst 
give  me  a  soul  by  thy  divine  and  quickening  breath.  Wherefore,  O 
Christ,  give  rest  to  thy  servant  in  the  land  of  the  living,  in  the  habitations 
of  the  Just. 

Tone  VII.  When,  in  the  beginning,  thou  hadst  created  man  after  thine 
own  image  and  likeness,  thou  didst  set  him  in  Paradise  to  reign  over  thy 
creatures.  But  when,  beguiled  by  the  malice  of  the  Devil,  he  tasted  of 
the  food,  he  became  a  transgressor  of  thy  commandments.  For  which 
cause,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  condemn  him  to  return  again  unto  the  earth 
whence  he  was  taken,  and  to  entreat  repose. 

Tone  VIII  I  weep  and  I  wail  when  I  think  upon  death,  and  behold 
our  beauty,  fashioned  after  the  image  of  God,  lying  in  the  tomb  disfigured, 
dishonoured,  bereft  of  form.  O  marvel!  What  is  this  mystery  which 
doth  befall  us?  Why  have  we  been  given  over  unto  corruption,  and  why 
have  we  been  wedded  unto  death?  Of  a  truth,  as  it  is  written,  by  the 
command  of  God,  who  giveth  the  departed  rest. 

The  Beatitudes.     Tone  VI. 

Remember  us,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit:  for  theirs  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

Blessed  are  they  that  mourn:  for  they  shall  be  comforted. 

Blessed  are  the  meek:  for  they  shall  inherit  the  earth. 

Blessed  are  they  that  do  hunger  and  thirst  for  righteousness'  sake :  for 
they  shall  be  filled. 

Blessed  are  the  merciful:  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy. 

O  Christ,  who,  because  of  his  repentance,  didst  pronounce  in  anticipa- 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN)  387 

tion  a  citizen  of  Paradise  the  Thief  that  upon  the  Cross  cried  unto  thee : 
Remember  me!     Make  thou  me,  a  sinner,  worthy  also  of  the  same. 

Blessed  are  the  pure  in  heart:  for  they  shall  see  God. 

O  thou  who  reignest  over  life  and  death,  in  the  courts  of  thy  Saints 
grant  rest  unto  him  {her)  whom  thou  hast  removed  from  temporal  things. 
And  remember  me  also,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  peacemakers:  for  they  shall  be  called  the  children  of 
God. 

O  thou  who  rulest  over  souls  and  bodies,  in  whose  hand  is  our  breath, 
the  Consolation  of  the  afflicted :  In  the  land  of  the  Just  give  rest  unto  thy 
servant  whom  thou  hast  taken  from  us. 

Blessed  are  they  which  are  persecuted  for  righteousness'  sake:  for  theirs 
is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

May  Christ  give  thee  rest  in  the  land  of  the  living,  and  open  unto  thee 
the  gates  of  Paradise,  and  make  thee  a  citizen  of  his  kingdom ;  and  give 
thee  remission  of  those  things  wherein  thou  in  life  hast  sinned,  O  thou 
who  lovest  Christ. 

Blessed  are  ye  when  men  shall  revile  you,  and  persecute  you,  and  shall 
say  all  manner  of  evil  against  you,  falsely,  for  my  sake. 

Let  us  go  forth,  and  gaze  into  the  tombs:  for  man  is  naked  bones,  food 
for  the  worms,  and  stench ;  and  we  shall  learn  what  are  riches,  and  comeli- 
ness, and  beauty,  and  strength. 

Rejoice,  and  be  exceeding  glad :  for  great  is  your  reward  in  heaven :  for 
so  persecuted  they  the  prophets  which  were  before  you. 

Let  us  hearken  unto  what  the  Almighty  crieth:  Woe  unto  those  who 
seek  to  behold  the  terrible  day  of  the  Lord!  For  lo,  it  is  darkness:  for  all 
men  shall  be  tried  by  fire. 

Glory     .  . 

Him  who  hath  no  beginning  in  birth  or  cause,  the  Father  who  bestoweth 
birth,  I  worship;  the  Son,  who  is  born,  I  glorify;  unto  the  Holy  Spirit,  who 
shineth  together  with  the  Father  and  the  Son,  I  sing  praises. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

How  dost  thou  press  milk  in  abundance  from  thy  breasts,  O  Virgin? 
How  dost  thou  nourish  the  Nourisher  of  creation?  He  knoweth  it  who 
made  the  water  to  well  forth  from  the  rock ;  streams  of  water  for  a  people 
that  were  athirst,  as  it  was  written.

Reader,  (i  Thess.  iv.  13-18.)  Brethren:  I  would  not  have  you  to  be 
ignorant  concerning  them  which  are  asleep,  that  ye  sorrow  not,  even  as 
others  which  have  no  hope.  For  if  we  believe  that  Jesus  died  and  rose 
again,  even  so  them  also  which  sleep  in  Jesus  will  God  bring  with  him. 
For  this  we  say  unto  you  by  the  word  of  the  Lord,  that  we  which  are 
alive  and  remain  unto  the  coming  of  the  Lord  shall  not  prevent  them 
which  are  asleep.  For  the  Lord  himself  shall  descend  from  heaven  with  a 
shout,  with  the  voice  of  the  archangel,  and  with  the  trump  of  God :  and  the 
dead  in  Christ  shall  rise  first :  then  we  which  are  alive  and  remain  shall  be 
caught  up  together  with  them  in  the  clouds,  to  meet  the  Lord  in  the  air: 
and  so  shall  we  ever  be  with  the  Lord.

Priest.  {John  v.  24-30.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto 
him :  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  He  that  heareth  my  word  and  believeth 
on  him  that  sent  me,  hath  everlasting  life,  and  shall  not  come  into  con- 
demnation, but  hath  passed  from  death  unto  life.  Verily,  verily, . I  say 
unto  you,  The  hour  is  coming,  and  now  is,  when  the  dead  shall  hear  the 
voice  of  the  Son  of  God :  and  they  that  hear  shall  live.  For  as  the  Father 
hath  life  in  himself,  so  hath  he  given  to  the  Son  to  have  life  in  himself;  and 
hath  given  him  authority  to  execute  judgment  also,  because  he  is  the  Son 
of  man.  Marvel  not  at  this:  for  the  hour  is  coming,  in  the  which  all  that 
are  in  the  graves  shall  hear  his  voice,  and  shall  come  forth ;  they  that  have 
done  good,  unto  the  resurrection  of  life;  and  they  that  have  done  evil,  unto 
the  resurrection  of  damnation.  I  can  of  mine  own  self  do  nothing:  as  I 
hear,  I  judge:  and  my  judgment  is  just;  because  I  seek  not  mine  own  will, 
but  the  will  of  the  Father  which  hath  sent  me.

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany: 
Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  .  .  . 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  the  repose  .  .     {And  the  rest;  see  page  369.) 
Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  when  this  is  finished,  the  principal  Priest,  or  the  Bishop,  if  one  be  present, 
shall  say,  in  a  loud  voice,  as  he  standeth  near  the  dead,  while  all  the  Priests  present 
do  the  same,  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  {See  page  369.) 

Whenever  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  Litany,  the  Priests  each,  secretly,  recite,  the  while, 
according  to  his  rank,  this  Prayer,  standing  near  the  dead.  And  the  Exclamation 
shall  be  made,  aloud:  For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life:  and  the  rest. 
{See  page  369.) 

Then  the  principal  Priest,  or  the  Bishop,  shall  recite,  aloud,  the  Prayer  which  he 
hath  said  above:  O  God  of  spirits, 

And  after  the  Exclamation,  the  last  kiss  is  given,  and  the  following  Stanzas,  in  Tone 
II.,  are  sung: 

Come,  brethren,  let  us  give  the  last  kiss  unto  the  dead,  rendering 
thanks  unto  God.  For  he  {she)  hath  vanished  from  among  his  {her)  kin, 
and  presseth  onward  to  the  grave,  and  vexeth  himself  {herself)  no  longer 
concerning  vanities,  and  concerning  the  flesh,  which  suffereth  sore  distress. 
Where  are  now  his  {her)  kinsfolk  and  his  (^er)friends?  Lo,  we  are  parted. 
Let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  him  {her)  rest. 

What  is  this  parting,  O  brethren?  What  is  this  wailing,  what  this 
weeping  at  the  present  hour?  Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  kiss  him  {her) 
who  was  but  lately  with  us ;  for  he  {she)  is  committed  to  the  grave ;  he  {she) 
is  covered  with  a  stone;  he  {she)  taketh  up  his  {her)  abode  in  the  gloom; 
he  {she)  is  interred  among  the  dead,  and  now  is  parted  from  all  his  {her) 
kinsfolk  and  his  {her)  friends.  Let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give 
unto  him  {her)  eternal  rest. 

Now  is  life's  artful  triumph  of  vanities  destroyed.  For  the  spirit 
hath  vanished  from  its  tabernacle;  its  clay  groweth  black.  The  vessel 
is  shattered,  voiceless,  bereft  of  feeling,  motionless,  dead:  Committing 
which  unto  the  grave,  let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  him  {her) 
eternal  rest. 

What  is  our  life  like  unto?  Unto  a  flower,  a  vapour,  and  the  dew  of  the 
morning,  in  very  truth.  Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  gaze  keenly  at  the 
grave.  Where  is  the  beauty  of  the  body,  and  where  its  youth?  Where 
are  the  eyes  and  the  fleshly  form?  Like  the  grass  all  have  perished,  all 
have  been  destroyed.  Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  prostrate  ourselves  at 
the  feet  of  Christ  with  tears. 


390    THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN) 

A  great  weeping  and  wailing,  a  great  sighing  and  agony,  and  Hell  and 
destruction  is  the  departure  of  the  soul.  This  transitory  life  is  a  shadow 
unreal  and  an  illusive  dream ;  the  trouble  of  the  life  of  earth  is  a  phantasm 
importunate.  Let  us,  then,  flee  afar  from  every  earthly  sin,  that  we  may 
inherit  heavenly  things. 

As  we  gaze  on  the  dead  who  lieth  before  us,  let  us  all  accept  this 
example  of  our  own  last  hour.  For  he  (she)  vanisheth  from  earth  like  the 
smoke;  like  a  flower  he  (she)  is  faded;  like  the  grass  he  (she)  is  cut  down. 
Swathed  in  a  coarse  garment  he  (she)  is  concealed  in  the  earth.  As  we 
leave  him  (her)  hidden  from  sight,  let  us  beseech  Christ  that  he  will  give 
unto  him  (her)  eternal  rest. 

Draw  nigh,  ye  descendants  of  Adam,  let  us  gaze  upon  him  (her)  who  is 
laid  low  in  the  earth,  made  after  our  own  image,  all  comeliness  stripped  off, 
dissolved  in  the  grave  by  decay,  by  worms  in  darkness  consumed,  and 
hidden  by  the  earth.  As  we  leave  him  (her)  hid  from  sight,  let  us  beseech 
Christ  that  he  will  give  unto  him  (her)  eternal  rest. 

When  the  soul  from  the  body  is  about  to  be  rent  with  violence  by 
Angels  dread,  it  forgetteth  all  its  kinsfolk  and  acquaintance,  and  is 
troubled  concerning  its  appearance  before  the  judgment  which  shall  come 
upon  the  things  of  vanity  and  much-toiling  flesh.  Come  ye,  then,  im- 
portuning the  Judge  let  us  implore  that  the  Lord  will  pardon  him  (her)  all 
his  (her)  deeds  which  he  (she)  hath  done. 

Come,  O  brethren,  let  us  gaze  into  the  grave  upon  the  dust  and  ashes 
from  which  we  are  made.  Whither  go  we  now?  What  are  we  become? 
Who  is  poor,  who  rich ?  Who  is  the  master?  Who  a  freeman?  Are  not 
we  all  ashes?  The  beauty  of  the  countenance  is  mouldered,  and  Death 
hath  withered  up  all  the  flower  of  youth. 

Vanity  and  corruption,  of  a  truth,  are  all  the  illusions,  the  inglorious 
things  of  life.  For  all  we  shall  pass  away:  all  we  shall  die,  kings  and 
princes,  judges  and  rulers,  rich  and  poor,  and  every  mortal  creature.  For 
now  they  who  were  erst  alive  are  cast  down  into  the  grave.  Wherefore, 
let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  rest. 

Now  are  all  the  bodily  organs  seen  to  be  idle,  which  so  little  while  ago 
were  filled  with  motion;  all  useless,  dead,  unconscious.  For  the  eyes  have 
withdrawn  inward,  the  feet  are  bound,  the  hands  lie  helpless,  and  the  ears 
withal ;  the  tongue  is  imprisoned  in  silence,  committed  to  the  tomb.  Of  a 
verity,  all  mortal  things  are  vanity. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 
O  thou  who  savest  those  who  fix  their  hope  on  thee,  the  Mother  of  the 
Sun  that  knoweth  no  setting,  O  Progenetrix  of  God;  With  thy  prayers 
entreat,  we  beseech  thee,  the  God  exceeding  good,  that  unto  him  (her) 
who  hath  now  been  translated  he  will  give  repose  where  the  souls  of  the 
righteous  rest.  Manifest  him  (her)  an  heir  of  good  things  divine,  in  the 
courts  of  the  Just,  unto  everlasting  memory,  O  All-undefiled  One. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN)  391 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Tone  VI.  As  ye  behold  me  lie  before  you  all  speechless  and  bereft  of 
breath,  weep  for  me,  O  friends  and  brethren,  O  kinsfolk  and  acquaintance. 
For  but  yesterday  I  talked  with  you,  and  suddenly  there  came  upon  me 
the  dread  hour  of  death.  But  come,  all  ye  who  loved  me,  and  kiss  me 
with  the  last  kiss.  For  nevermore  shall  I  walk  or  talk  with  you.  For  I 
go  hence  unto  the  Judge  with  whom  is  no  respect  of  persons.  For  slave 
and  master  stand  together  before  him,  king  and  warrior,  the  rich  and  the 
poor,  in  honour  equal.  For  according  to  his  deeds  shall  every  man  receive 
glory  or  be  put  to  shame.  But  I  beg  and  implore  you  all,  that  ye  will 
pray  without  ceasing  unto  Christ-God,  that  I  be  not  doomed  according  to 
my  sins,  unto  a  place  of  torment;  but  that  he  will  appoint  unto  me  a  place 
where  is  the  light  of  life. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  in  the  same  Tone. 

Through  the  prayers  of  her  who  gave  thee  birth,  O  Christ;  and  of  thy 
Forerunner;  of  the  Apostles,  Prophets,  Hierarchs,  Holy  Ones,  of  the  Just, 
and  of  all  the  Saints:  Give  rest  unto  thy  servant  who  is  fallen  asleep. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  (See  page  368.)  Glory  .  .  .  now,  and 
ever,  .     .  O  all-holy  Trinity,  Lord,  have  mercy.      {Thrice.)     Glory 

.     .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  .  Our  Father,  .     .  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  .  .  . 

Then:  With  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dead  {See  page  368.)     And  the  rest. 

And  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  .  .  {See  page 
369.)  While  the  Priest  saith,  secretly,  the  Prayer:  0  God  of  spirits,  .  .  {See 
page  369.) 

And  after  the  Exclamation:  Glory         now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

And  the  Benediction. 

May  he  who  rose  again  from  the  dead,  Christ  our  true  God;  through 
the  prayers  of  his  all-pure  Mother;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable 
Apostles;  of  our  holy  and  God-bearing  Fathers,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  es- 
tablish in  the  mansions  of  the  righteous  the  soul  of  his  servant,  N.,  who 
hath  been  taken  from  us;  give  him  (her)  rest  in  Abraham's  bosom,  and 
number  him  (her)  with  the  Just;  and  have  mercy  upon  us,  forasmuch  as  he 
is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  or  the  principal  Priest  saith,  thrice: 

Eternal  be  thy  memory,  O  our  brother,  who  art  worthy  to  be  deemed 
happy  and  ever-memorable. 

Or:  Give  rest  eternal  in  blessed  falling  asleep,  O  Lord,  to  the  soul (s)  of 
thy  servant  (s),  N    (NN.),  departed  this  life,  and  make  his  (her,  their) 

memory  to  be  eternal. 

And  the  Choir  singeth: 

Memory  eternal!     (Thrice.) 


392     THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN) 

Then  straightway  the  Bishop,  if  one  be  present,  or  the  Priest,  reciteth,  aloud,  the 
Parting  Prayer: 

Mav  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  gave  his  divine  commands  to 
his  holy  Disciples  and  Apostles,  that  they  should  bind  and  loose  the  sins 
of  the  fallen  (we,  in  turn,  having  received  from  them  the  right  to  do  the 
same)  pardon  thee,  O  spiritual  child,  all  thy  deeds  done  amiss  in  this  life, 
both  voluntary  and  involuntary:  Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages- 
Amen. 

But  in  place  of  this  prayer,  the  following,  called  the  Prayer  of  Absolution,  is  now 
generally  read:  and  being  printed  separately,  when  the  Priest  hath  finished  it,  he 
layeth  it  in  the  dead  person's  hand. 
Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  by  his  divine  grace,  as  also  by  the  gift  and 
power  vouchsafed  unto  his  holy  Disciples  and  Apostles,  that  they  should 
bind  and  loose  the  sins  of  men :  (For  he  said  unto  them :  Receive  ye  the 
Holy  Spirit :  Whosesoever  sins  ye  remit,  they  are  remitted ;  and  whoseso- 
ever sins  ye  retain  they  are  retained.  And  whatsoever  ye  shall  bind  or 
loose  upon  earth  shall  be  bound  or  loosed  also  in  heaven.)  By  that  same 
power,  also,  transmitted  unto  us  from  them,  this  my  spiritual  child,  N.,  is 
absolved,  through  me,  unworthy  though  I  be,  from  all  things  wherein,  as 
mortal,  he  (she)  hath  sinned  against  God,  whether  in  word,  or  deed,  or 
thought,  and  with  all  his  (her)  senses,  whether  voluntarily  or  involuntarily; 
whether  wittingly  or  through  ignorance.  If  he  (she)  be  under  the  ban  or 
excommunication  of  a  Bishop,  or  of  a  Priest;  or  hath  incurred  the  curse  of 
his  (her)  f athor  or  mother ;  or  hath  fallen  under  his  (her)  own  curse ;  or  hath 
sinned  by  any  oath;  or  hath  been  bound,  as  man,  by  any  sins  whatsoever, 
but  hath  repented  him  (her)  thereof,  with  contrition  of  heart:  he  (she)  is 
now  absolved  from  all  those  faults  and  bonds.  May  all  those  things 
which  have  proceeded  from  the  weakness  of  his  (her)  mortal  nature  be  con- 
signed to  oblivion,  and  be  remitted  unto  him  (her):  Through  His  loving- 
kindness;  through  the  prayers  of  our  most  holy,  and  blessed,  and  glorious 
Lady,  the  Mother  of  our  Lord  and  ever- virgin  Mary;  of  the  holy,  glorious 
and  all-laudable  Apostles,  and  of  all  Saints.     Amen. 

Then  taking  up  the  remains  we  go  forth  to  the  grave,  followed  by  all  the  people,  and 
preceded  by  the  Priest,  and  singing: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  Glory  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  .  O  all- 
holy  Trinity,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.)  Glory  .  .  .  now,  and 
ever,  .  .  .  Our  Father,     .  .  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  .  .  .  (Page  368.) 

And  the  mortal  remains  are  buried  with  thanksgiving  and  with  joy:  and  with  the 
song:  Open,  O  earth,  and  receive  that  which  was  made  from  thee.  Then  the 
body  is  laid  in  the  grave,  and  the  Bishop  or  the  Priest,  taking  a  shovelful  of  dust, 
streweth  it  crosswise  upon  the  remains,  saying: 

The  earth  is  the  Lord's,  and  the  fulness  thereof:  the  round  world,  and 
they  that  dwell  therein. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN)     393 

Then  he  poureth  upon  the  body  oil  from  the  shrine-lamp,  (3)  and  streweth  ashes  (4) 
from  the  censer  upon  it.  And  thereafter  the  grave  is  filled  up  in  the  usual  way, 
while  these  Hymns  are  sung. 

.  With  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dead,  give  rest,  O  Saviour,  to  the  soul  of 
thy  servant,  preserving  it  unto  the  life  of  blessedness  which  is  with  thee, 
O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

In  the  place  of  thy  rest,  O  Lord,  where  all  thy  Saints  repose,  give  rest, 
also,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant:  For  thou  only  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Thou  art  the  God  who  descended  into  hell,  and  loosed  the  bonds  of  the 
captives:  Do  thou  give  rest,  also,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Virgin  alone  Pure  and  Undented,  who  without  seed  didst  bring  forth 
God,  pray  thou  unto  him  that  his  (her)  soul  may  be  saved. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD 

(PRIESTS)  (i)* 

When  one  of  the  Secular  Clergy  departeth  unto  the  Lord,  three  Priests  come  and 
undress  him  and  (2)  rub  him  with  pure  oil.  Then  they  array  him  in  his  customary 
garments;  (3)  and  over  them,  in  his  priestly  vestments;  and  they  cover  his  face  with 
a  chalice-veil,  and  lay  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  on  his  breast.  Then  come  the 
Priests,  vested  in  their  priestly  robes.     And  the  Senior  Priest  beginneth: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  (And  the  rest,  as  at  the  Burial  of  Laymen. 

See  page  368).  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  .  .  Glory  .  .  now,  and 
ever,  .  .  O  all-holy  Trinity,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.)  Glory  .  .  .

honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.) 
Glory  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  .  Bless.  The  Benediction:  May  Christ,  our 
true  God,  .  .  . 

Then  they  take  up  the  remains  of  the  Priest,  and  bear  them  to  the  porch  (or  the  body) 
of  the  Church;  and  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  (which  hath  been  borne  in  front  of 
them)  is  laid  upon  them,  as  hath  already  been  said;  and  candlesticks,  with  their 
tapers,  are  set  round  about,  in  cross-form.  And  a  Chanter  beginneth,  in  Tone  VI., 
Psalm  cxix.: 

Blessed  are  those  that  are  undented  in  the  way,  .  .  .  Alleluia.  (And 
the  rest,  as  at  the  Burial  of  Laymen  (see  page  371),  to  the  end  of  the  Hymn: 
O  Christ-God,  who  from  a  Virgin  didst  shine  forth  upon  the  world, 
through  her  making  us  children  of  the  light,  have  mercy  upon  us.  See 
page  380.) 

Then  the  Degrees  (Stepenni)  of  Antiphon  I.,  in  Tone  VI. 

I  will  lift  up  mine  eyes  unto  the  heavens,  unto  thee,  O  Word.  Show 
thy  bounty  upon  me,  that  I  may  live  unto  thee. 

Have  mercy  upon  us  who  are  humble  of  heart,  making  us  thy  vessels 
meet  for  thy  service,  O  Word. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

The  Holy  Spirit  is  of  all  things  the  all-redeeming  Source.  If  upon  any 
man  he  breatheth  because  the  same  is  worthy,  quickly  doth  He  take  him 
from  earthly  objects,  endueth  him  with  wings,  raiseth  him  up,  and  estab- 
lisheth  him  on  high. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

Reader.  (1  Thess.  iv.  13-18.)  Brethren:  I  would  not  have  you  to  be 
ignorant  concerning  them  which  are  asleep,  that  ye  sorrow  not,  even  as 
others  which  have  no  hope.  For  if  we  believe  that  Jesus  died  and  rose 
again,  even  so  them  also  which  sleep  in  Jesus  will  God  bring  with  him. 
For  this  we  say  unto  you  by  the  word  of  the  Lord,  that  we  which  are 
alive  and  remain  unto  the  coming  of  the  Lord  shall  not  prevent  them 
which  are  asleep.  For  the  Lord  himself  shall  descend  from  heaven  with 
a  shout,  with  the  voice  of  the  archangel,  and  with  the  trump  of  God :  and 
the  dead  in  Christ  shall  rise  first:  then  we  which  are  alive  and  remain 
shall  be  caught  up  together  with  them  in  the  clouds,  to  meet  the  Lord

Priest.  (John  v.  24-30.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto 
him:  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  He  that  heareth  my  word,  and  be- 
lieveth  on  him  that  sent  me,  hath  everlasting  life,  and  shall  not  come  into 
condemnation;  but  is  passed  from  death  unto  life.  Verily,  verily,  I  say 
unto  you,  The  hour  is  coming,  and  now  is,  when  the  dead  shall  hear  the 
voice  of  the  Son  of  God :  and  they  that  hear  shall  live.  For  as  the  Father 
hath  life  in  himself;  so  hath  he  given  to  the  Son  to  have  life  in  himself; 
and  hath  given  him  authority  to  execute  judgment  also,  because  he  is  the 
Son  of  man.  Marvel  not  at  this:  for  the  hour  is  coming,  in  the  which  all 
that  are  in  the  graves  shall  hear  his  voice,  and  shall  come  forth;  they  that 
have  done  good,  unto  the  resurrection  of  life;  and  they  that  have  done

evil,  unto  the  resurrection  of  damnation.  I  can  of  mine  own  self  do  noth- 
ing; as  I  hear,  I  judge:  and  my  judgment  is  just;  because  I  seek  not  mine 
own  will,  but  the  will  of  the  Father  which  hath  sent  me.

And  the  Priest  saith  this  Prayer: 

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  alone  hast  immortality,  and  dwellest  in 
light  unapproachable;  who  slayest  and  makest  alive;  who  castest  down 
into  Hell,  and  again  raisest  up;  Thou  who  in  wisdom  hast  created  man, 
and  returnest  him  to  the  earth  again,  exacting  the  spiritual  debt: 
Receive,  we  beseech  thee,  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  and  grant  him  rest 
in  the  bosom  of  Abraham,  and  Isaac,  and  Jacob;  and  give  him  the 
crown  of  thy  righteousness,  the  portion  of  the  saved,  in  the  glory  of  thine 
elect.  And  for  those  things  which  in  this  world  he  hath  wrought  for  thy 
Name's  sake,  may  he  receive  a  rich  reward  in  the  mansions  of  thy 
Saints;  through  the  grace,  and  bounties,  and  love  toward  mankind  of 
thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.     Amen. 

Hymn,  Tone  II.  To-day  part  I  from  my  kinsfolk,  and  flee  unto  thee,  the 
Only  Sinless  One.  In  the  mansions  of  the  righteous  with  thine  elect 
grant  me  rest.

Forasmuch  as  we  all  are  constrained  to  that  same  dread  abode,  and

shortly  turn  to  dust,  let  us  implore  of  Christ  rest  for  him  who  hath  been 
translated  hence.  For  such  is  our  life  here,  brethren,  a  mockery  upon 
the  earth ;  when  we  have  no  being,  to  receive  it,  and  when  we  have  being 
to  dissolve  into  corruption.  We  are  a  fleeting  dream;  a  breath  which 
endureth  not;  the  flight  of  a  passing  bird;  a  ship  which  leaveth  no  trace

Deem  him  worthy  of  thy  bliss  never-ending,  O  Lord.

Reader.  The  Lesson  from  the  Epistle  of  the  holy  Apostle  Paul  to  the 
Romans. 

(Rom.  v.  ij-22.)  Wherefore,  brethren,  as  by  one  man  sin  entered  into 
the  world,  and  death  by  sin;  and  so  death  passed  upon  all  men,  for  that 
all  have  sinned.  (For  until  the  law,  sin  was  in  the  world:  but  sin  is  not 
imputed  when  there  is  no  law-  Nevertheless,  death  reigned  from  Adam 
to  Moses,  even  over  them  that  had  not  sinned  after  the  similitude  of 
Adam's  transgression,  who  is  the  figure  of  him  that  was  to  come.  But 
not  as  the  offence,  so  also  is  the  free  gift.  For  if  through  the  offence  of  one 
many  be  dead,  much  more  the  grace  of  God,  and  the  gift  by  grace,  which 
is  by  one  man,  Jesus  Christ,  hath  abounded  unto  many.  And  not  as  it 
was  by  one  that  sinned,  so  is  the  gift.  For  the  judgment  was  by  one  to 
condemnation,  but  the  free  gift  is  of  many  offences  unto  justification. 
For  if  by  one  man's  offence  death  reigned  by  one;  much  more  they  which 
receive  abundance  of  grace,  and  of  the  gift  of  righteousness,  shall  reign  in 
life  by  one,  Jesus  Christ.)  Therefore,  as  by  the  offence  of  one  judgment 
came  upon  all  men  to  condemnation,  even  so  by  the  righteousness  of  one 
the  free  gift  came  upon  all  men  unto  justification  of  life.  For  as  by  one 
man's  disobedience  many  were  made  sinners,  so  by  the  obedience  of  one 
shall  many  be  made  righteous.  Moreover  the  law  entered,  that  the 
offence  might  abound.  But  where  sin  abounded,  grace  did  much  more 
abound:  that  as  sin  hath  reigned  unto  death,  even  so  might  grace  reign 
through  righteousness  unto  eternal  life  by  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord.

(And  the  prefaces  to  the  Gospel,  as  usual.  See  page  395-) 
(John  v.  17-25.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him:  My 
Father  worketh  hitherto,  and  I  work.  Therefore  the  Jews  sought  the 
more  to  kill  him,  because  he  not  only  had  broken  the  sabbath,  but  said 
also,  that  God  was  his  Father,  making  himself  equal  with  God.  Then 
answered  Jesus,  and  said  unto  them,  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  The 
Son  can  do  nothing  of  himself,  but  what  he  seeth  the  Father  do :  for  what 
things  soever  he  doeth,  these  also  doeth  the  Son  likewise.  For  the  Father 
loveth  the  Son,  and  showeth  him  all  things  that  himself  doeth:  and  he 


398     THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

will  show  him  greater  works  than  these,  that  ye  may  marvel.  For  as  the 
Father  raiseth  up  the  dead,  and  quickeneth  them,  even  so  the  Son  quick- 
eneth  whom  he  will.  For  the  Father  judgeth  no  man ;  but  hath  committed 
all  judgment  unto  the  Son:  that  all  men  should  honour  the  Son,  even  as 
they  honour  the  Father.  He  that  honoureth  not  the  Son,  honoureth  not 
the  Father  which  hath  sent  him.  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  he  that 
heareth  my  word,  and  believeth  on  him  that  sent  me,  hath  everlasting 
life,  and  shall  not  come  into  condemnation;  but  is  passed  from  death  unto 
life.

life  immortal,  and  thy  glory  is  ineffable,  and  thy  love  toward  mankind  is 
unutterable,  and  thy  kingdom  faileth  not  forever,  and  with  thee  there  is 
no  respect  of  persons;  for  unto  all  men  thou  hast  appointed  a  common 
debt  of  life,  whose  measure  must  be  fulfilled.  Wherefore  we  entreat 
thee,  O  Lord  our  God:  Give  rest  in  the  bosom  of  Abraham,  and  Isaac,  and 
Jacob  unto  thy  servant,  N.,  erstwhile  a  priest  and  our  fellow-minister, 
who  hath  fallen  asleep  in  the  hope  of  resurrection  unto  life  eternal.  And  as 
thou  didst  appoint  him  to  be  a  minister  of  thy  Church  on  earth,  so  also  do 
thou  make  him  the  same  at  thy  heavenly  altar,  O  Lord.  As  thou  hast 
adorned  him  with  spiritual  honour  among  men,  so  also  receive  thou  him 
uncondemned  into  the  glory  of  the  Angels.  Thou  thyself  hast  dignified 
his  life  upon  the  earth;  in  like  manner,  also,  make  thou  glorious  the  exit 
of  his. life  at  his  entrance  among  thy  holy  Saints,  and  number  his  soul 
with  all  those  who  from  all  the  ages  have  been  well-pleasing  in  thy  sight. 
For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life,  and  the  Rest  of  thy  servant, 
N.,  who  hath  fallen  asleep,  O  Christ  our  God ;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe 
glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

If  the  Lord  had  not  been  on  our  side,  we  had  not  been  able  to  withstand

Let  not  my  soul  be  caught  like  a  bird,  in  their  teeth,  O  Word.  Woe  is

The  Lesson  from  the  Epistle  of  the  holy  Apostle  Paul  to  the  Corin- 
thians. 

(/  Cor.  xv.  1-12.)  Brethren:  I  declare  unto  you  the  gospel  which  I 
preached  unto  you,  which  also  ye  have  received,  and  wherein  ye  stand; 
by  which  also  ye  are  saved,  if  ye  keep  in  memory  what  I  preached  unto 
you,  unless  ye  have  believed  in  vain.  For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of 
all,  that  which  I  also  received,  how  that  Christ  died  for  our  sins  according 
to  the  scriptures;  and  that  he  was  buried,  and  that  he  rose  again  the 
third  day  according  to  the  scriptures:  and  that  he  was  seen  of  Cephas, 
then  of  the  twelve :  after  that,  he  was  seen  of  above  five  hundred  brethren 
at  once;  of  whom  the  greater  part  remain  unto  this  present,  but  some 
are  fallen  asleep.  After  that,  he  was  seen  of  James;  then  of  all  the 
apostles.  And  last  of  all  he  was  seen  of  me  also,  as  of  one  born  out  of  due 
time.  For  I  am  the  least  of  the  apostles,  that  am  not  meet  to  be  called  an 
apostle,  because  I  persecuted  the  church  of  God.  But  by  the  grace  of 
God  I  am  what  I  am :  and  his  grace  which  was  bestowed  upon  me,  was  not 
in  vain;  but  I  laboured  more  abundantly  than  they  all:  yet  not  I,  but  the 
grace  of  God  which  was  with  me.  Therefore  whether  it  were  I  or  they, 
so  we  preach,  and  so  ye  believed. 

Alleluia.     Blessed  is  he  whom  thou  hast  chosen  and  taken,  O  Lord.

(John  vi.  35-39.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him:  I 
am  the  bread  of  life:  he  that  cometh  to  me,  shall  never  hunger;  and  he 
that  believeth  on  me,  shall  never  thirst.  But  I  said  unto  you,  That  ye 
also  have  seen  me,  and  believe  not.  All  that  the  Father  giveth  me,  shall 
come  to  me;  and  him  that  cometh  to  me,  I  will  in  no  wise  cast  out.  For  I 
came  down  from  heaven,  not  to  do  mine  own  will,  but  the  will  of  him 
that  sent  me.  And  this  is  the  Father's  will  which  hath  sent  me,  that  of 
all  which  he  hath  given  me,  I  should  lose  nothing,  but  should  raise  it  up 
again  at  the  last  day.

God.  In  that  we  set  our  hope  on  thee  may  we  not  fail,  but  through  thee 
may  we  be  delivered  from  adversities;  for  thou  art  the  salvation  of  all 
Christian  people.

(i  Cor.  xv.  20-2Q.)  Brethren:  Now  is  Christ  risen  from  the  dead,  and 
become  the  first-fruits  of  them  that  slept.  For  since  by  man  came  death, 
by  man  came  also  the  resurrection  of  the  dead.  For  as  in  Adam  all  die, 
even  so  in  Christ  shall  all  be  made  alive.  But  every  man  in  his  own 
order:  Christ  the  first-fruits;  afterward  they  that  are  Christ's  at  his 
coming.  Then  cometh  the  end,  when  he  shall  have  delivered  up  the 
kingdom  to  God,  even  the  Father;  when  he  shall  have  put  down  all  rule, 
and  all  authority,  and  power.  For  he  must  reign,  till  he  hath  put  all 
enemies  under  his  feet.  The  last  enemy  that  shall  be  destroyed  is  death. 
For  he  hath  put  all  things  under  his  feet.  But  when  he  saith  all  things 
are  put  under  him,  it  is  manifest  that  he  is  excepted  which  did  put  all 
things  under  him.  And  when  all  things  shall  be  subdued  unto  him,  then 
shall  the  Son  also  himself  be  subject  unto  him  that  put  all  things  under 
him,  that  God  may  be  all  in  all.     Else  what  shall  they  do,  which  are  bap-

The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  John. 

(John  vi.  40-44.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him, 
And  this  is  the  will  of  him  that  sent  me,  that  every  one  which  seeth  the 
Son,  and  believeth  on  him,  may  have  everlasting  life:  and  I  will  raise  him 
up  at  the  last  day.  The  Jews  then  murmured  at  him,  because  he  said,  I 
am  the  bread  which  came  down  from  heaven.  And  they  said,  Is  not  this 
Jesus  the  son  of  Joseph,  whose  father  and  mother  we  know?  how  is  it  then 
that  he  saith,  I  came  down  from  heaven?  Jesus  therefore  answered  and 
said  unto  them,  Murmur  not  among  yourselves.  No  man  can  come  to 
me,  except  the  Father  which  hath  sent  me  draw  him:  and  I  will  raise  him 
up  at  the  last  day. 

Then  the  Beatitudes.     Tone  II. 

In  thy  kingdom  remember  us,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest  into  thy 
kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit:  for  theirs  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

Blessed  are  they  that  mourn :  for  they  shall  be  comforted. 

Blessed  are  the  meek:  for  they  shall  inherit  the  earth. 

Blessed  are  they  which  do  hunger  and  thirst  after  righteousness:  for 
they  shall  be  filled. 

Blessed  are  the  merciful :  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy. 

For  when  Adam,  of  old,  had  eaten  of  the  tree  which  was  for  food,  he 
was  driven  forth  from  Paradise.  But  when  the  Thief,  as  he  hung  upon 
the  cross,  confessed  thee  God,  he  was  made  a  citizen  of  Paradise.  And 
we,  who  have  been  saved  by  thy  Passion,  O  Master,  imitating  the  Thief, 
with  faith  do  cry:  Remember  us,  also,  when  thou  comest  into  thy  king- 
dom. 

Blessed  are  the  pure  in  heart:  for  they  shall  see  God. 

Taking  clay  from  the  earth,  He  who  created  me,  fashioned  my  body 
through  his  will  divine;  and  having  breathed  into  it  a  soul  with  his  life- 
bearing  breath,  he  laid  upon  it  a  holy  command.  Therefore  hast  thou 
called  me,  who  am  subject  to  the  corruption  of  sin,  O  thou  who  lovest 
mankind,  because  of  thy  boundless  tenderness  of  heart.  But  grant  rest 
with  thy  Saints,  O  God,  unto  him  whom  thou  hast  called. 

Blessed  are  the  peacemakers:  for  they  shall  be  called  the  children  of 
God. 

When  the  soul  from  the  body  is  parted,  fearful  is  the  mystery  and 
terrible  to  all  men;  for  the  soul  goeth  forth  lamenting,  and  the  body  is 
committed  to  the  earth,  and  hidden  from  sight.  Wherefore,  in  that  we, 
also,  have  learned  our  final  end,  let  us  make  appeal  unto  the  Saviour. 


404    THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

crying  aloud,  with  tears:  Remember  us  also,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest 
into  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  they  which  are  persecuted  for  righteousness'  sake:  for  theirs 
is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

Why  mourn  ye  me  so  violently,  O  men?  Why  clamour  ye  so  vainly? 
he  who  is  called  hence  proclaimeth  unto  all.  Death  is  a  rest  unto  all 
men.  Therefore  let  us  listen  to  the  voice  of  Job,  when  he  saith :  Death  is 
rest  unto  man.  But  grant  rest  with  thy  Saints,  O  God,  unto  him  whom 
thou  hast  taken. 

Blessed  are  ye  when  men  shall  revile  you,  and  shall  persecute  you,  and 
shall  say  all  manner  of  evil  against  you,  falsely,  for  my  sake. 

Paul,  all-wise,  clearly  did  foretell  translation  hence,  teaching  all  men 
that  the  dead  shall  rise  again  incorruptible,  and  we  shall  be  changed  by 
command  divine.  Then  shall  the  trumpet  ring  out  with  dreadful  clang, 
and  they  who  in  all  the  ages  have  gone  unto  their  rest  shall  arise  from 
their  sleep.  But  grant  rest  with  thy  Saints,  O  God,  unto  him  whom  thou 
hast  taken. 

Rejoice,  and  be  exceeding  glad:  for  great  is  your  reward  in  heaven. 

He  who  is  gone  hence  and  lieth  dead  in  the  grave,  in  gracious  reconcilia- 
tion crieth  unto  all :  Come  unto  me,  ye  earth-born ;  behold  the  beauty  of 
the  body  all  turned  to  blackness.  Wherefore,  O  brethren,  forasmuch  as 
we  have  learned  therefrom  the  end,  unto  the  Saviour  let  us  make  appeal, 
crying  with  tears:  Grant  rest  with  thy  Saints,  O  God,  unto  him  whom 
thou  hast  taken. 

Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 
In  supernatural  wise,  O  Lady,  without  seed  thou  didst  conceive  in  thy 
womb  the  God  who  was  before  all  the  ages,  and  didst  bear  him  in  the 
flesh,  both  God  and  man,  without  change  of  Essence,  and  with  Essence 
still  unmingled.  Wherefore,  we  acknowledge  thee  ever  as  the  Birth -giver 
of  God,  and  unto  the  God  who  was  born  of  thee  with  faith  we  cry:  Re- 
member us,  also,  in  thy  kingdom.

not  regard  it.  He  that  eateth,  eateth  to  the  Lord,  for  he  giveth  God 
thanks;  and  he  that  eateth  not  to  the  Lord  he  eateth  not,  and  giveth 
God  thanks.     For  none  of  us  liveth  to  himself,  and  no  man  dieth  to  him-

we  die  unto  the  Lord:  whether  we  live  therefore,  or  die,  we  are  the 
Lord's.

{The  customary  prefaces  to  the  Gospel.) 

The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  John. 

{John  vi.  48-54.)  The  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him,  I 
am  that  bread  of  life.  Your  fathers  did  eat  manna  in  the  wilderness, 
and  are  dead.  This  is  the  bread  which  cometh  down  from  heaven,  that 
a  man  may  eat  thereof,  and  not  die.  I  am  the  living  bread  which  came 
down  from  heaven:  if  any  man  eat  of  this  bread,  he  shall  live  forever: 
and  the  bread  that  I  will  give  is  my  flesh,  which  I  will  give  for  the  life  of 
the  world.  The  Jews  therefore  strove  among  themselves,  saying,  How 
can  this  man  give  us  his  flesh  to  eat?  Then  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Verily, 
verily,  I  say  unto  you,  Except  ye  eat  the  flesh  of  the  Son  of  man,  and 
drink  his  blood,  ye  have  no  life  in  you.  Whoso  eateth  my  flesh,  and 
drinketh  my  blood,  hath  eternal  life;  and  I  will  raise  him  up  at  the  last 
day.

loving-kindness. 

Graciously  grant,  O  Word,  that  he  may  stand  in  holiness  with  thine 
elect  on  thy  right  hand,  in  the  hope  of  resurrection  from  the  dead.  O 
thou  who  lovest  mankind,  we  fervently  entreat  thee  with  the  voice  of 
praise. 

Graciously  grant,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind,  that  thy  chosen  servant, 
who  hath  been  taken  from  earth,  may  radiantly  rejoice  in  thy  heavenly, 
august  kingdom;  regard  not  his  spiritual  transgressions,  forasmuch  as 
thou  art  of  tender  loving-kindness.

Woe  is  me !  For  earthly  glory  hath  suddenly  sprung  up  like  the  grass, 
and  straightway  hath  withered.  What  is  rank  in  the  grave?  What  is 
comeliness  or  beauty  there?  Therefore,  O  Lord,  spare  thou  thy  servant, 
forasmuch  as  thou  art  full  of  loving-kindness.

As  is  our  bounden  duty,  we  all  with  love  sing  praises  unto  thee  ever,  O 
Mary,  Virgin  all-undefiled,  the  Mother  of  God,  in  that  we  have  the  sleep-

Hymns.  There  is  no  man  upon  the  earth  who  sinneth  not,  O  Word. 
Accept,  therefore,  the  petition  of  us  humble  ones;  and  pardon,  remit,  O 
Saviour,  all  the  iniquities  of  thy  servant. 

And  who  is  full  of  love  toward  mankind  like  unto  thee,  O  merciful 
Lord,  who  with  great  power  forgivest  sins  both  to  the  living  and  also  to 
the  dead?     Wherefore,  save  thou  thy  servant,  by  the  same  power. 

Glory  .  .  . 

Of  thy  heavenly  calling,  O  Saviour,  make  thou  an  heir  him  who,  in 
faith,  hath  been  translated  hence,  accepting  this  last  tearful  prayer, 
O  only  Sinless  One.

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Cease  not  thou,  who  art  our  true  Lady,

him  who  hath  departed  this  life  in  the  faith  he  will  mercifully  vouchsafe 
his  heavenly  kingdom. 

Sitting-Hymn  (Syeddlen) ,  in  Tone  VI. 
Of  a  truth,  all  things  are  vanity,  and  life  is  but  a  shadow  and  a  dream. 
For  in  vain  doth  every  one  who  is  born  of  earth  disquiet  himself,  as  saith 
the  Scriptures.  When  we  have  acquired  the  world,  then  do  we  take  up 
our  abode  in  the  grave,  where  kings  and  beggars  lie  down  together. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ  our  God,  give  rest  to  thy  servant  departed  this  life; 
forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind.

unto  the  company  of  those  who  were  in  hell;  For  thou  art  almighty. 

Hymns.  Forasmuch  as  the  judgment  of  that  dread  day  of  wrath  is 
not  to  be  endured,  let  us  diligently  entreat  of  Christ  remission  of  all 
iniquities  for  him  who  hath  departed  this  life  in  faith  and  in  the  hope  of 
resurrection. 

Mercifully  vouchsafe,  O  Christ,  unto  this  thy  servant,  who,  through 
repentance  ere  his  death  burned  before  thee  as  a  bright  light  thy  man- 
sions of  light,  O  Master,  Saviour,  tenderly  compassionate.

repentance  unto  all  us  sinning  mortals.  Forasmuch  as  thou  art  the  Lord, 
unto  this  man  also  graciously  vouchsafe  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

Through  thy  power  as  God,  in  sovereign  wise  dost  thou  show  mercy, 
O  Lord,  upon  thy  creatures  whom  thou  hast  brought  into  subjection  to

Thou  only  art  immortal,  who  hast  created  and  fashioned  man.  For  out 
of  the  earth  were  we  mortals  made,  and  unto  the  earth  shall  we  return 
again,  as  thou  didst  command  when  thou  madest  me,  saying  unto  me: 
For  earth  thou  art,  and  unto  the  earth  shalt  thou  return.  Whither,  also, 
we  mortals  wend  our  way,  making  of  our  funeral  dirge  the  song:  Alleluia. 

In  thought  I  implore  ye,  hearken  unto  me:  For  with  difficulty  do  I 
announce  these  things.  For  your  sakes  have  I  made  moan;  perchance 
it  may  profit  one  of  you.  But  when  ye  shall  sing  these  things  make  men- 
tion, now  and  then,  of  me  whom  ye  once  knew.  For  often  have  we  walked 
together,  and  together  in  the  house  of  God  have  sung:  Alleluia. 

Rise  now,  all  ye,  and  make  ready,  and  when  ye  are  set,  hearken  ye 
unto  the  word.  Terrible,  my  brethren,  is  the  Judgment  Seat  before 
which  all  we  must  appear.  There  is  neither  bondman  nor  freeman  there; 
there  is  neither  small  nor  great;  but  we  shall  all  stand  naked  there. 
Wherefore,  it  is  good  ofttimes  to  sing  together  the  psalm:  Alleluia. 

Let  us  all  be  consumed  with  tears,  when  we  behold  the  earthly  remains 
lying  low;  and  when  we  shall  all  draw  near  to  kiss,  and  peradventure  to

Thou  speakest  no  more  with  us,  O  friend.  Why  speakest  thou  not,  as 
thou  wert  wont  to  speak,  but  boldest  thus  thy  peace  who  before  with  us 
didst  say:  Alleluia. 

Why  these  bitter  words  of  the  dying,  O  brethren,  which  they  utter  as 
they  go  hence?  I  am  parted  from  my  brethren.  All  my  friends  do  I 
abandon,  and  go  hence.  But  whither  I  go,  that  understand  I  not,  neither 
what  shall  become  of  me  yonder;  only  God,  who  hath  summoned  me 
knoweth.     But  make  commemoration  of  me  with  the  song:  Alleluia. 

But  whither  now  go  the  souls?  How  dwell  they  now  together  there? 
This  mystery  have  I  desired  to  learn,  but  none  can  impart  aright.  Do 
they  call  to  mind  their  own  people,  as  we  do  them?  Or  have  they  for- 
gotten all  those  who  mourn  them  and  make  the  song:  Alleluia? 

Accompany  ye  the  dead,  O  friends,  and  come  ye  to  the  grave  with 
heed,  and  there  gaze  ye  steadfastly,  with  understanding;  and  make  ready 
your  feet.  All  youth  is  fallen  to  dissolution  there;  there  all  the  flower  of 
life  is  faded;  there  are  dust,  and  ashes,  and  worms;  there  all  is  silence;  and 
there  no  man  saith:  Alleluia. 

Lo!  now  behold  we  him  who  lieth  here,  but  ne'er  shall  lie  before  us 
more.  Lo!  already  is  his  tongue  stilled,  and  lo!  his  mouth  hath  ceased 
to  speak.  Fare  ye  well,  O  my  friends,  my  children.  Fare  ye  well,  O 
brethren!  Fare  ye  well,  O  my  comrades;  for  I  go  forth  upon  my  way. 
But  make  commemoration  of  me  with  the  song:  Alleluia. 

None  of  the  dwellers  yonder  have  returned  to  life  to  tell  us  how  there 
they  fare,  our  erstwhile  brethren  and  our  kinsfolk  gone  before  us  to  the 
Lord.  Wherefore,  again  and  oft  we  say:  Shall  we  see  each  other  there? 
Shall  we  see  our  brethren  there?  Shall  we  there  again  together  say  the 
psalm:  Alleluia? 

We  go  forth  on  the  path  eternal,  and  as  condemned,  with  downcast 
faces,  present  ourselves  before  the  only  God  eternal.  Where  then  is  come- 
liness? Where  then  is  wealth?  Where  then  is  the  glory  of  this  world? 
There  shall  none  of  these  things  aid  us,  but  only  to  say  oft  the  psalm: 
Alleluia. 

Why  dost  thou  untimely  vex  thyself,  O  man !  Yet  one  hour,  and  all 
things  shall  pass  away.  For  in  Hell  there  is  no  repentance,  nor  further 
remission  there.  There  is  the  worm  that  sleepeth  not;  there  is  the  land, 
all  dark  and  gloomy,  where  I  must  be  judged.  For  I  made  not  haste  to 
say  oft  the  psalm:  Alleluia. 

Naught  is  so  easily  forgot  as  mortal  from  his  brother-mortal  parted. 
If  for  a  brief  space  we  call  to  mind,  yet  straightway  forget  we  Death,  as 
we  had  not  ourselves  to  die.  Parents,  also,  utterly  forget  their  children, 
whom  from  their  own  bodies  they  have  borne  and  reared ;  and  they  have 
dropped  tears  with  the  song:  Alleluia. 

I  will  remember  ye,  O  my  brethren;  and  my  children,  and  my  friends, 


4Ю  THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

forget  me  not,  when  unto  the  Lord  ye  pray.  I  entreat,  I  beseech,  I  im- 
plore, that  ye  learn  by  heart  this  thing,  and  mourn  for  me  night  and  day. 
As  said  Job  unto  his  friends,  so  say  I  also  unto  you:  Sit  ye  again  and  say: 
Alleluia. 

Leaving  all  things  behind  us,  forth  we  go,  and  naked  and  grieving  must 
present  ourselves  to  God.  For  like  the  grass  doth  beauty  fade,  and  we 
men  only  are  allured  therewith.  Naked  wast  thou  born,  O  wretched 
one,  and  naked  there  must  every  man  appear.  Dream  not,  O  mortal,  of 
sweetness  in  this  life,  but  only  groan  ever  with  the  moan:  Alleluia. 

If  thou  hast  shown  mercy  unto  man,  O  man,  that  same  mercy  shall 
be  shown  thee  there;  and  if  on  an  orphan  thou  hast  shown  compassion, 
the  same  shall  there  deliver  thee  from  want.  If  in  this  life  the  naked 
thou  hast  clothed,  the  same  shall  give  thee  shelter  there,  and  sing  the 
psalm:  Alleluia. 

Toilsome  the  way  in  which  I  must  go  hence,  the  which,  in  truth,  I 
never  yet  have  trod ;  and  unknown  is  that  land,  and  no  one  knoweth  ought 
of  me  there.  Awesome  is  it  to  behold  my  guides;  most  terrible  he  who 
hath  called  me,  the  Ruler  of  life  and  death,  who  also  calleth  us,  when  he 
willeth,  thither:  Alleluia. 

If  journeying  from  a  home-land  we  stand  in  need  of  guides,  what  shall 
we  do  when  forth  we  fare  to  a  land  to  us  still  all  unknown?  Many  lead- 
ers wilt  thou  then  require,  many  prayers  to  accompany  thee,  to  save 
the  wretched  sinner's  soul;  until  thou  come  to  Christ  and  say  to  him: 
Alleluia. 

They  who  are  in  thrall  to  the  material  passions  shall  find  no  pardon 
whatsoever  there.  For  there  are  the  dread  accusers ;  there,  also,  the  books 
are  opened.  Where,  then,  around  about  thee  wilt  thou  gaze,  O  man? 
And  who  then  shall  succour  thee?  Unless  thou  hast  led  an  upright  life, 
and  hast  done  good  to  the  needy,  singing:  Alleluia. 

Youth  and  the  beauty  of  the  body  fade  at  the  hour  of  death,  and  the 
tongue  then  burneth  fiercely,  and  the  parched  throat  is  inflamed.  The 
beauty  of  the  eyes  is  quenched  then,  the  comeliness  of  the  face  all  altered, 
the  shapeliness  of  the  neck  destroyed ;  and  the  other  parts  have  become 
numb,  nor  often  say:  Alleluia. 

Hush,  then;  be  dumb.  Henceforward  keep  ye  silence  before  him  who 
lieth  there,  and  gaze  upon  the  mighty  mystery;  for  terrible  is  this  hour. 
Be  silent,  that  the  soul  may  issue  forth  in  peace.  For  it  to  a  great  ordeal 
is  constrained,  and  in  fear  doth  oft  petition  make  to  God:  Alleluia. 

I  have  beheld  a  dying  child,  and  I  have  mourned  my  life.  For  he  was 
all  agitated,  and  trembled  greatly  when  the  hour  was  come,  and  cried, 
O  father,  help  me!  O  mother,  save  me !  And  no  one  then  could  succour 
him,  but  only  stood  helpless  as  they  gazed  on  him,  and  wept  for  him  in  the 
grave:  Alleluia. 

How  many  suddenly  are  snatched  to  the  tomb  even  from  the  plighting.

of  their  troth,  and  united  by  a  bond  eternal ;  and  without  avail  have  made 
their  moan  unending,  and  have  not  risen  from  that  bridal  chamber!  But 
there  was  both  marriage  and  the  grave,  both  union  and  disunion,  both 
laughter  and  weeping,  and  the  psalm:  Alleluia. 

With  ecstasy  are  we  inflamed  if  we  but  hear  that  there  is  light  eternal 
yonder;  that  there  is  the  fountain  of  our  life,  and  there  delight  eternal; 
that  there  is  Paradise,  wherein  every  soul  of  Righteous  Ones  rejoiceth. 
Let  us  all,  also,  enter  into  Christ,  that  all  we  may  cry  aloud  thus  unto 
God :  Alleluia. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  all-holy  Virgin  unwedded,  who 
hast  brought  forth  the  Light  Ineffable,  I  make  petition  never  ceasing, 
and  beseech  thee,  and  entreat  thee:  Implore  thou  the  Lord  perpetually 
for  thy  servant  who  hath  fallen  asleep,  O  most  pure  One;  that  he  may 
find  there  remission  of  his  iniquities  in  the  Day  of  Judgment,  O  All-pure 
One.     For  thou,  O  Lady,  hast  boldness  ever  to  beseech  thy  Son:  Alleluia. 

The  Collect-Hymn. 
Give  rest  with  the  Saints,  O  Christ,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  where 
there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  everlasting. 
The  Ikos.  Thou  only  art  immortal,  .     .    (See  page  383.) 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song.  O  marvel  unutterable!  He  who  delivered  the  Holy 
Children  in  the  fiery  furnace  from  the  flames  is  laid  dead,  bereft  of  breath, 
in  the  grave,  for  the  salvation  of  us  who  sing:  O  God  our  Redeemer, 
blessed  art  thou. 

Hymns.  From  the  fires  of  Hell  and  the  dread  sentence  of  condemnation 
deliver  thou,  O  Christ,  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind,  thy  servant 
whom  thou  hast  now  taken  hence  in  the  faith.  And  grant  that  thy  ser- 
vant may  sing  unto  thee:  O  God  our  Redeemer,  blessed  art  thou. 

O  God,  who  hast  been  graciously  pleased  to  establish  in  the  land  of 
the  meek,  in  the  delights  of  Paradise,  in  the  marvellous  tabernacle  of 
glory,  thy  servant  who  in  faith  hath  fallen  asleep,  grant  that  he  may  sing 
unto  thee:  O  God,  our  Redeemer,  blessed  art  thou. 

Glory 

Great  is  the  judgment,  and  indescribable  is  the  distress  of  Hell,  O  my 
brethren:  for  the  souls  of  sinners  are  burned  therein,  together  with  their 
bodies.  And  with  pain  do  they  weep,  unable  to  cry:  O  God  our  Redeemer, 
blessed  art  thou. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  Birth-giver  of  God  all-undefiled, 
encompass  thou  ever  with  thy  prayers  the  living  who  with  understanding 
sing  praises  unto  thee  as,  beyond  a  doubt,  the  Mother  of  God ;  and  deliver 
thou  from  bitter  torments  those  who  have  departed  this  life;  that  they 
may  cry  aloud  unto  Christ:  O  God  our  Redeemer,  blessed  art  thou.

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song.  Fear  with  trembling,  O  ye  heavens,  and  let  the  founda- 
tions of  the  earth  be  shaken.  For  lo!  he  who  dwelleth  on  high  is  num- 
bered among  the  dead,  and  is  lodged  in  the  narrow  grave.  Ye  Children, 
bless;  ye  Priests,  sing  praises;  ye  People,  magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages. 

Hymns.  What  a  dread  hour  awaiteth  sinners,  O  brethren!  O  what 
is  the  terror  then,  when  Hell's  fire  unquenchable  shall  consume  and  tor- 
ture evermore!  Wherefore,  O  Christ,  bountiful  Master,  deliver  thou 
from  the  dread  ban  him  who  this  day  hath  been  translated  from  us,  that 
he  may  escape  the  torments  of  Hell  forevermore. 

O  the  joy  of  the  Righteous,  which  they  shall  receive  when  the  Judge 
shall  come!  For  there  a  mansion  is  prepared,  and  Paradise,  and  all 
Christ's  kingdom:  wherein  establish  thou  thy  servant,  making  him  glad 
with  the  Saints,  O  Christ,  forevermore. 

Glory 

Who  shall  withstand,  O  Christ,  the  dread  menace  of  thy  coming  again? 
For  then  shall  the  heavens  be  rolled  up  like  a  scroll,  in  terrible  wise;  and 
the  stars  shall  fall;  and  all  creation  shall  quake  with  fear;  and  the  light 
shall  suffer  sombre  change.  But  in  that  day,  O  Word,  spare  thou  him 
who  hath  been  translated  from  us. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  He  who,  in  more  than  mortal  wise, 
was  incarnate  of  thee  as  thy  Son,  O  Pure  One,  the  same  is  the  Judge  both 
of  the  quick  and  of  the  dead,  and  judgeth  all  the  earth,  and  saveth  from 
torment  whomsoever  he  willeth :  More  especially  those  who,  with  love,  do 
worship  him  in  his  manifestations,  and  who  sing  praises  unto  thee,  O 
Birth-giver  of  God,  unto  all  the  ages. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song.  Lament  not  for  me,  O  Mother,  when  thou  beholdest 
in  the  grave  thy  Son  whom,  without  seed,  thou  didst  conceive  in  thy 
womb.  For  I  shall  rise  again  and  glorify  myself;  and  in  that  I  am  God, 
I  will  raise  in  glory  that  hath  no  ending  those  who,  with  faith  and  love, 
do  magnify  thee. 

Hymns.  Mourn  not  all  ye  who  have  died  in  the  faith:  for  Christ  hath 
endured  for  us  the  flesh,  the  cross,  and  the  grave,  making  children  of 
immortality  all  those  who  cry  aloud  unto  him:  Enter  thou  not  into  judg- 
ment with  thy  servant. 

Let  us  fervently  entreat  Christ,  O  ye  faithful,  that  he  will  establish 
in  the  abode  of  the  blessed  our  brother  who  hath  fallen  asleep  in  the 
faith,  and  in  the  hope  of  resurrection.  For  there  is  the  stern  judgment 
seat,  and  the  dread  trial,  and  none  can  aid  himself;  but  only  good  deeds 
and  the  united  prayers  of  the  faithful.  And  so  let  us  cry  aloud:  Enter 
thou  not  into  judgment  with  thy  servant,  O  Lord. 

Glory  .  .

In  thy  glory  which  waxeth  not  old,  in  the  sweetness  of  Paradise,  estab-

more  than  mortal  wise  the  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  faithful  devoutly

Now  am  I  at  rest,  and  have  found  great  release,  in  that  I  have  been

Verse:  But  the  truth  of  the  Lord  abideth  forever. 

And  after  each  Verse  the  Exapostildrion  is  repeated. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Now  have  I  chosen  the  Maiden  Mother  of  God:  for  Christ,  the  Re-

Thy  godly  minister,  made  a  partaker  of  the  nature  divine  in  his  trans- 
lation hence,  through  thy  life-giving  mystery,  O  Christ,  is  now  come  unto 
thee.  Receive  thou  his  soul  in  thy  hand,  as  it  were  a  bird,  O  Saviour. 
Establish  thou  him  in  thy  courts,  and  in  the  choir  of  the  Angels;  and  be- 
cause of  thy  great  mercy,  O  Lord,  give  rest  unto  him  whom  thou  hast 
taken  by  thy  command. 


4Н    THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

Strange  is  the  mystery  of  death :  for  it  cometh  to  all  untimely.  Nature 
is  dissolved  by  force.  It  taketh  old  men,  abbots  and  learned  men;  it 
slayeth  the  teachers  of  vain  philosophies,  bishops  and  pastors,  and  every 
nature  of  mortals.  But  let  us  cry  aloud,  with  tears:  Because  of  thy  great 
mercy,  O  Lord,  give  rest  unto  him  whom  thou  hast  taken  by  thy  command. 

He  who  lived  in  godliness,  and  was  adorned  as  thy  priest,  O  Christ,  the 
sacrificer  and  minister  of  thy  mysteries  divine,  by  thy  divine  command 
hath  passed  over  from  life's  clamour  unto  thee.  Save  him  whom,  as 
Priest,  thou  didst  accept,  O  Saviour;  and  because  of  thy  great  mercy,  give 
unto  him  rest  with  the  Just. 

Glory     .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  We  have  come  to  the  knowledge  of 
God  who  was  incarnate  of  thee,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God:  Entreat 
thou  him  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Then  shall  be  read: 

Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  towards  men. 
We  praise  thee,  we  bless  thee,  we  worship  thee,  we  glorify  thee,  we  give 
thanks  to  thee  for  thy  great  glory,  O  Lord  God,  heavenly  King,  God  the 
Father  Almighty.  O  Lord,  the  Only-begotten  Son  Jesus  Christ,  and  the 
Holy  Spirit;  O  Lord  God,  Lamb  of  God,  Son  of  the  Father,  that  takest 
away  the  sins  of  the  world,  have  mercy  upon  us.  Thou  that  takest  away 
the  sins  of  the  world,  receive  our  prayer.  Thou  that  sittest  at  the  right 
hand  of  God  the  Father,  have  mercy  upon  us.  For  thou  only  art  holy ; 
thou  only  art  the  Lord ;  thou  only,  O  Jesus  Christ,  with  the  Holy  Spirit, 
art  most  high  in  the  glory  of  God  the  Father.    Amen. 

Every  day  will  I  give  thanks  unto  thee,  and  praise  thy  Name  forever 
and  ever.  Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge  from  one  generation  to 
another.  I  said,  Lord,  be  merciful  unto  me;  heal  my  soul,  for  I  have 
sinned  against  thee.  I  flee  unto  thee.  Teach  me  to  do  thy  will;  for  thou 
art  my  God.  For  with  thee  is  the  well  of  life,  and  in  thy  light  shall  we 
see  light.  O  continue  forth  thy  loving-kindness  unto  them  that  know 
thee.  Vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  to  keep  us  this  day  without  sin.  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  fathers,  and  praised  and  glorified  be  thy  holy 
Name  forever. 

Let  thy  merciful  kindness,  O  Lord,  be  upon  us,  as  we  do  put  our  trust 
in  thee. 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord:  O  teach  me  thy  statutes.     (Thrice.) 

Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge  from  one  generation  to  another.  I 
said:  Lord,  be  merciful  unto  me:  heal  my  soul,  for  I  have  sinned  against 
thee. 

Lord,  I  flee  unto  thee.  O  teach  me  to  do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee; 
for  thou  art  my  God.  For  with  thee  is  the  well  of  life,  and  in  thy  light 
shall  we  see  light.  O  continue  forth  thy  loving-kindness  unto  those  who 
know  thee. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS)    415 

Then  the  following  Stanzas  (Stikhiri),  by  St.  John  of  Damascus.  Tone  I. 
What  earthly  sweetness  remaineth  unmixed  with  grief?  What  glory 
standeth  immutable  on  earth?  All  things  are  but  shadows  most  feeble, 
but  most  deluding  dreams:  yet  one  moment  only,  and  Death  shall  sup- 
plant them  all.  But  in  the  light  of  thy  countenance,  O  Christ,  and  in  the 
sweetness  of  thy  beauty,  give  rest  unto  him  whom  thou  hast  chosen: 
forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Verse  (Stikh) :  The  Lord  is  my  shepherd,  I  shall  not  want. 
In  very  deed,  O  my  Saviour,  dost  thou  show  forth  that  thou  art  the 
Resurrection  of  all  men,  who,  by  thy  word,  O  Word,  didst  raise  up 
Lazarus  from  the  dead.  Then  were  the  bars  shattered,  and  the  gates  of 
Hell  were  confounded.  Then  was  man's  death  shown  to  be  but  a  sleep. 
But  do  thou,  who  art  come  to  save  thy  creation,  and  not  to  condemn  it, 
give  rest  unto  him  whom  thou  hast  chosen:  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest 
mankind. 

Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thou  hast  manifested  thyself  a  fervent 
Intercessor  for  all  men,  O  Birth-giver  of  God;  the  Protector  of  all  men, 
and  the  Power  of  God  to  those  who  have  recourse  unto  thee ;  the  Succour 
of  those  who  are  in  need ;  a  speedy  Deliverance  unto  those  who  are  cap- 
tive. For  Christ  hath  appointed  thee  to  be  an  Avenger  and  a  Champion 
against  the  barbarian,  and  a  Wall  indestructible,  and  a  Fortress  impreg- 
nable for  the  weak;  and  the  Bestower  of  peace  upon  our  souls. 

Stanzas  (Stikhiri),  in  Tone  II.  Woe  is  me!  What  manner  of  ordeal 
doth  the  soul  endure  when  from  the  body  it  is  parted !  Woe  is  me !  how 
many  then  are  its  tears ;  and  there  is  none  to  show  compassion !  It  turn- 
eth  its  eyes  to  the  Angels ;  all  unavailing  is  its  prayer.  It  stretcheth  out  its 
hands  to  men;  and  findeth  none  to  succour.  Wherefore,  my  brethren 
beloved,  meditating  on  the  brevity  of  our  life,  let  us  beseech  of  Christ 
rest  for  him  who  hath  departed  hence;  and  for  our  souls  great  mercy. 
Verse:  I  called  upon  the  Lord  when  I  was  in  trouble,  and  he  heard  me. 
Come,  let  us  all  gaze  upon  the  marvel  that  is  past  understanding:  he 
who  but  yesterday  was  with  us  now  lieth  dead.  Come,  let  us  learn  how 
that,  in  a  little  while,  we  also  shall  end  in  the  swa thing-bands  of  death. 
How  lie  they  in  stench,  who  were  anointed  with  sweet-smelling  spices! 
How  lie  they  who  erst  bedecked  themselves  with  gold,  now  unadorned, 
bereft  of  form!  Wherefore,  my  brethren  beloved,  let  us  meditate  upon 
the  brevity  of  our  life,  and  entreat  of  Christ  rest  for  him  who  hath  been 
translated  hence ;  and  for  our  souls  great  mercy. 

Verse:  Deliver  my  soul,  O  Lord,  from  the  mouths  of  the  ungodly. 
Farewell,  vain  life!     Farewell,  all  ye,  my  kinsfolk,  friends  and  chil- 
dren!    For  I  tread  a  way  wherein  I  ne'er  have  walked.     But  come,  re- 
membering my  love  for  you,  follow  me,  and  commit  this,  my  mortal 
clay,  unto  the  grave:  And  make  entreaty  with  tears,  unto  Christ  who

shall  judge  my  humble  soul,  that  he  will  snatch  me  from  the  fire  un- 
quenchable. 

Glory  now,  and  ever,  ... 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thou  Gate  Impassable,  mystically 
sealed,  O  blessed  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  accept  thou  our  petitions, 
and  bear  them  unto  thy  Son  and  God ;  that  through  thee  he  may  save 
our  souls. 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  III  Lo,  here  I  lie,  my  brethren  beloved,  silent  and 
voiceless  amid  you  all.  My  mouth  is  idle,  my  tongue  is  stopped,  and 
my  lips  are  curbed;  my  hands  are  bound,  and  my  feet  are  fettered;  my 
semblance  is  changed,  mine  eyes  are  quenched,  and  behold  not  those 
who  make  moan;  mine  ears  receive  not  the  wail  of  the  mourners,  my  nose 
perceiveth  not  the  sweet  fragrance  of  the  incense.  But  true  love  can  in 
no  wise  die.  Wherefore  I  beseech  all  my  dear  ones :  Remember  me  before 
the  Lord  in  the  Day  of  Judgment,  that  I  may  find  mercy  at  that  dread 
Judgment  Seat. 

Verse:  I  will  lift  up  mine  eyes  unto  the  hills,  whence  cometh  my  help. 

All  mortal  things  are  vanity,  and  exist  not  after  death.  Riches  endure 
not,  neither  doth  glory  accompany  on  the  way:  for  when  death  cometh, 
all  these  things  vanish  utterly.  For  which  cause  let  us  cry  unto  Christ 
the  Immortal:  To  him  who  hath  been  translated  from  among  us,  give 
thou  rest  where  is  the  abode  of  those  who  are  glad. 

Verse:  The  Lord  shall  preserve  thy  going  out  and  thy  coming  in,  from 
this  time  forth,  even  forevermore. 

O  men,  why  vex  we  ourselves  in  vain?  Swift  and  grievous  is  the  course 
we  run.  Life  is  a  smoke,  and  vapour,  and  ashes,  and  clay;  and  soon  shall 
we  be  dust,  and  like  a  flower  shall  we  wither  away.  Wherefore,  unto 
Christ,  the  King  Immortal,  let  us  cry:  To  him  who  hath  been  translated 
from  among  us,  give  thou  rest  where  is  the  abode  of  all  who  are  glad. 

Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thee  as  a  Haven  of  salvation,  O 
Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  have  we  who  are  tempest-tossed  on  the  sea 
of  life.  Wherefore,  entreat  thou  him  who,  without  seed,  was  incarnate  of 
thee,  and  in  wise  ineffable  was  made  man,  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  IV.  Where  is  earthly  predilection?  Where  is  the 
pomp  of  the  ephemeral  creatures  of  a  day?  Where  are  the  gold  and 
the  silver?  Where  is  the  multitude  of  household  servants  and  their 
clamour?  All  dust,  all  ashes,  all  shadows.  But  come,  let  us  cry  aloud 
unto  the  King  Immortal:  O  Lord,  thine  eternal  good  things  vouchsafe 
thou  unto  him  who  hath  been  translated  from  us,  giving  him  rest  in  thy 
blessedness  which  waxeth  not  old. 

Verse:  I  rejoiced  when  they  said  unto  me:  Let  us  go  into  the  house  of 
the  Lord. 

Death  came  like  a  robber;  he  came,  the  corrupter,  and  laid  me  low; 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS)     417 

he  came,  the  corrupter,  and  made  me  as  one  that  existeth  not;  he  came, 
and  being  earth,  I  He  as  though  I  were  not.  Of  a  truth  are  we  mortals 
a  dream;  of  a  truth  are  we  a  vision.  But  come,  unto  the  King  Immortal 
let  us  cry:  Thine  eternal  good  things  vouchsafe  thou,  O  Lord,  unto  him 
who  hath  been  translated  from  us,  granting  him  rest  in  the  life  which 
waxeth  not  old. 

Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  Virgin  alone  Pure  and  Undefiled,  who 
without  seed  didst  bring  forth  God :  Pray  thou  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  V  I  called  to  mind  the  Prophet,  how  he  cried:  I 
am  earth  and  ashes;  and  I  looked  again  into  the  graves,  and  beheld  the 
bones  laid  bare;  and  I  said:  Who  then  is  the  king  or  warrior,  the  rich 
man  or  the  needy,  the  upright  or  the  sinner?  Yet  give  rest  with  thy 
Saints,  unto  thy  servant,  O  Lord. 

Verse:  Our  feet  have  stood  in  thy  courts,  O  Jerusalem. 

Thou  hast  said,  O  Christ,  that  he  who  believeth  on  thee  shall  not  see 
death;  and  forasmuch  as  I,  from  the  Light  in  the  Light,  am  the  Light, 
so  also  shall  ye  be  illumined  with  me  in  my  glory.  For,  being  very  God, 
I  am  come  to  save  those  who,  in  true  right  belief,  do  honour  me,  the  only 
Lord  God,  twofold  in  nature,  of  flesh  and  Godhead,  but  one  in  Person. 
Wherefore,  in  the  light  of  thy  countenance,  with  the  Saints,  give  rest 
unto  this  thy  faithful  servant,  who  hath  confessed  me:  forasmuch  as  thou 
lovest  mankind. 

Glory         now,  and  ever,  .     . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  We  entreat  thee,  as  the  Mother  of  God, 
O  Blessed  One:  Beseech  thou  him  that  he  will  save  us. 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  VI  Thy  creating  command  was  my  origin  and  my 
foundation:  for  thy  pleasure  it  was,  out  of  nature  visible  and  invisible, 
to  fashion  me,  a  living  creature.  From  the  earth  thou  didst  shape  my 
body,  and  didst  give  me  a  soul  by  thy  divine  and  quickening  breath. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ,  give  rest  to  thy  servant,  in  the  land  of  the  living, 
in  the  habitations  of  the  Just. 

Verse:  Unto  thee  have  I  lifted  up  mine  eyes,  O  thou  who  dwellest  in 
the  heavens. 

With  thine  own  image  hast  thou  honoured  the  work  of  thy  hands,  O 
Word,  depicting  in  material  form  the  likeness  of  thine  Essence  super- 
sensual;  whereof,  also,  thou  hast  made  me  a  participant,  placing  me  on 
earth  to  rule  with  independent  lordship  over  created  things.  Wherefore, 
O  Saviour,  give  rest  unto  thy  servant,  in  the  land  of  the  living,  in  the 
habitations  of  the  Just. 

Glory  .       now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  We  have  come  to  the  knowledge  of  God 
who  was  incarnate  of  thee,  O  Virgin  Birth -giver  of  God.  Entreat  thou 
him  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 


4i8  THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  VII.  When,  in  the  beginning,  thou  hadst  created 
man  after  thine  own  image  and  likeness,  thou  didst  set  him  in  Paradise 
to  reign  over  thy  creatures.  But  when,  beguiled  by  the  malice  of  the 
Devil,  he  tasted  of  the  food,  he  became  a  transgressor  of  thy  command- 
ments. For  which  cause,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  condemn  him  to  return 
again  unto  the  earth  whence  he  was  taken,  and  to  entreat  repose. 

Verse:  How  amiable  are  thy  tabernacles,  O  Lord  of  hosts. 

Death  which  looseth  every  sorrow  is  granted  unto  the  race  of  Adam. 
For  we  became  subject  unto  corruption  through  the  eating  of  the  fruit; 
for  we  know  that,  as  we  were  made  of  earth,  dust  shall  we  be  again,  and 
ashes,  as  we  were  before.  Wherefore,  with  the  voice  of  entreaty,  let  us 
beseech  the  Creator  that  he  will  grant  pardon  and  mercy  unto  him  who 
hath  been  translated  hence. 

Glory     .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  We  faithful  have  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of 
God,  for  a  Wall  impregnable  and  a  steadfast  Hope.  Wherefore,  cease 
thou  not,  O  Lady,  to  entreat  for  thy  servants  who  have  fallen  asleep  in  the 
faith  that  they  may  receive  pardon  at  the  Judgment  Day,  when  thy  Son 
and  God  shall  sit  as  Judge  (for  thou  knowest  our  nature,  how  that  of  every 
manner  of  sin  are  we  now  commingled) ;  that  we  may  all  bless  thee. 

Stanzas,  in  Tone  VIII.  I  weep  and  I  wail  when  I  think  upon  death,  and 
behold  our  beauty,  fashioned  after  the  image  of  God,  lying  in  the  tomb, 
disfigured,  dishonoured,  bereft  of  form.  O  marvel !  What  is  this  mystery 
which  doth  befall  us?  Why  have  we  been  given  over  unto  corruption, 
and  why  have  we  been  wedded  unto  death?  Of  a  truth,  as  it  is  written, 
by  the  command  of  God,  who  giveth  the  departed  rest. 

How  are  we  become  subject  unto  corruption,  we  who  have  borne  the 
image  of  the  Incorruptible,  and  have  received  a  soul  immortal  through  the 
breath  divine,  and  so  are  become  of  blended  nature,  as  it  is  written?  How 
have  we  sinned  against  the  commands  of  God?  O  marvel!  How  have 
we,  abandoning  the  food  of  God,  eaten  the  fruit  which  begetteth  death 
and  bitterness?  How,  being  led  astray,  have  we  bereft  ourselves  of  life 
divine?  Henceforth  let  us  cry  unto  Christ:  In  thy  courts  establish  thou 
him  whom  thou  hast  translated  hence. 

Glory       .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thy  protection,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of 
God,  is  spiritual  healing.  For  having  recourse  thereunto,  we  are  re- 
leased from  our  spiritual  ills. 

Stanzas  in  Tone  VIII  Measureless  is  the  torment  of  those  who  have 
lived  lewdly;  gnashing  of  teeth  and  wailing  unconsoled;  gloom  unlight- 
ened  and  outer  darkness,  the  worm  that  sleepeth  not,  tears  unavailing, 
and  judgment  without  mercy.  For  which  cause,  ere  the  end  shall  come, 
let  us  cry  aloud  and  say :  Unto  this  man  whom  thou  hast  chosen,  O  Lord 
Christ,  give  rest  with  thine  elect. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS)     419 

The  trump  shall  thunder  forth  its  sound,  and  the  dead  shall  rise  as  it 
were  from  sleep,  desiring  with  great  longing  to  receive  the  heavenly  life, 
setting  their  hope  on  thee,  their  Creator  and  their  Lord.  Condemn  thou 
not,  therefore,  thy  servant,  O  Immortal  One,  who  for  our  sake  didst 
become  mortal.  For  which  cause,  ere  the  end  shall  come,  let  us  cry  aloud 
and  say:  Unto  this  man  whom  thou  hast  chosen,  O  Lord  Christ,  give 
rest  with  thine  elect. 

Lo!  the  elements  and  heaven  and  earth  shall  be  changed;  and  all 
creation  shall  put  on  immortality,  and  mortality  shall  be  destroyed ;  and 
darkness  shall  flee  away  at  thy  coming.  For  thou  shalt  come  again  in 
glory,  as  it  is  written,  to  requite  unto  every  man  according  to  what  he 
hath  done.  Unto  this  man  whom  thou  hast  chosen,  O  Lord  Christ,  give 
rest  with  thine  elect. 

Glory  .  .     Tone  VI. 

Come  ye  all,  and  behold  a  sight  strange  and  terrible,  familiar  unto  all, 
the  image  to-day  beheld;  and  vex  yourselves  no  longer  about  temporal 
things.  To-day  is  the  soul  severed  from  the  body,  and  translated  to  the 
world  eternal;  for  it  setteth  out  upon  a  path  which  it  hath  never  trod,  and 
goeth  to  the  Judge  who  respecteth  not  persons,  where  the  Angelic  Hosts 
stand  round  about.  For  terrible,  O  my  brethren,  is  that  Judgment  Seat, 
where  all  we  naked  must  appear.  For  some  shall  be  put  to  shame,  and 
some  shall  receive  crowns.  Wherefore,  let  us  cry  unto  the  King  Immor- 
tal: When  thine  it  shall  be  to  try  the  secret  things  of  man,  spare  thy 
servant  whom  thou  hast  taken,  O  Lord  who  lovest  mankind. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  By  the  prayers  of  her  who  bare  thee, 
O  Christ,  and  of  thy  Forerunner;  of  the  Apostles,  Prophets,  Hierarchs, 
Holy  Ones,  and  Just,  and  of  all  the  Saints :  Give  rest  unto  thy  servant  who 
hath  fallen  asleep. 

Then  Psalm  xcii. 

It  is  a  good  thing  to  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  and  to  sing  praises  unto 
thy  Name,  O  Most  Highest:  to  tell  of  thy  loving-kindness  early  in  the 
morning,  and  of  thy  truth  in  the  night-season;  upon  an  instrument  of 
ten  strings,  and  upon  the  lute;  upon  a  loud  instrument,  and  upon  the 
harp.  For  thou,  Lord,  hast  made  me  glad  through  thy  works;  and  I  will 
rejoice  in  giving  praise  for  the  operations  of  thy  hands.  O  Lord,  how 
glorious  are  thy  works !  thy  thoughts  are  very  deep.  An  unwise  man  doth 
not  well  consider  this,  and  a  fool  doth  not  understand  it.  When  the  un- 
godly are  green  as  the  grass,  and  when  all  the  workers  of  wickedness  do 
flourish,  then  shall  they  be  destroyed  forever;  but  thou,  Lord,  art  the 
Most  Highest  for  evermore.  For  lo,  thine  enemies,  O  Lord,  lo,  thine 
enemies  shall  perish ;  and  all  the  workers  of  wickedness  shall  be  destroyed . 
But  mine  horn  shall  be  exalted  like  the  horn  of  an  unicorn;  for  I  am 


420  THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS) 

anointed  with  fresh  oil.  Mine  eye  also  shall  see  his  lust  of  mine  enemies, 
and  mine  ear  shall  hear  his  desire  of  the  wicked  that  arise  up  against  me. 
The  righteous  shall  nourish  like  a  palm-tree,  and  shall  spread  abroad  like 
a  cedar  in  Libanus.  Such  as  are  planted  in  the  house  of  the  Lord,  shall 
flourish  in  the  courts  of  the  house  of  our  God.  They  also  shall  bring  forth 
more  fruit  in  their  age,  and  shall  be  fat  and  well-liking;  that  they  may 
show  how  true  the  Lord  my  strength  is,  and  that  there  is  no  unrighteous- 
ness in  him. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  .  .  Glory  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  O  all- 
holy  Trinity,  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  {Thrice.)  Glory  .  .  .  now,  and 
ever,  .  Our  Father,  .  .  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  .  .  (See  the  Burial 
of  Laymen,  page  368.) 

Give  rest  with  the  Just,  O  Saviour,  unto  thy  servant,  and  establish 
him  in  thy  courts,  as  it  is  written:  Regarding  not,  in  that  thou  art  good, 
his  sins,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary,  and  all  things  committed 
either  with  knowledge  or  in  ignorance,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

In  the  place  of  thy  rest,  O  Lord,  where  all  thy  Saints  repose,  give  rest 
also  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant:  for  thou  only  lovest  mankind. 

O  Holy  Mother  of  the  Light  Ineffable,  with  songs  angelic  honouring, 
devoutly  do  we  magnify  thee. 

Then  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us:  and  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  .  .  .  (See 
page  369.) 

And  after  the  Exclamation,  the  last  kiss  is  given,  while  the  Choir  singeth: 

Come,  brethren,  let  us  give  the  last  kiss  unto  the  dead,  rendering 
thanks  unto  God.  For  he  hath  vanished  from  among  his  kin,  and  press- 
eth  onward  to  the  grave,  and  vexeth  himself  no  longer  concerning  van- 
ities, and  concerning  the  flesh,  which  suffereth  sore  distress.  Where  are 
now  his  kinsfolk  and  his  friends?  Lo,  we  are  parted.  Let  us  beseech  the 
Lord  that  he  will  give  him  rest. 

What  is  this  parting,  O  brethren?  What  is  this  wailing,  what  this 
weeping  at  the  present  hour?  Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  kiss  him  who 
was  but  lately  with  us;  for  he  is  committed  to  the  grave;  he  is  covered 
with  a  stone;  he  taketh  up  his  abode  in  the  gloom;  he  is  interred  among 
the  dead,  and  now  is  parted  from  all  his  kinsfolk  and  his  friends.  Let  us 
beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  unto  him  eternal  rest. 

Now  is  life's  artful  triumph  of  vanities  destroyed.  For  the  spirit  hath 
vanished  from  its  tabernacle;  its  clay  groweth  black.  The  vessel  is 
shattered,  voiceless,  bereft  of  feeling,  motionless,  dead.  Committing 
which  unto  the  grave,  let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  him  rest 
eternal. 

What  is  our  life  like  unto?  Unto  a  flower,  a  vapour,  and  the  dew  of 
the  morning,  in  very  truth.    Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  gaze  keenly  at  the 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS)      421 

grave.  Where  is  the  beauty  of  the  body,  and  where  its  youth?  Where 
are  the  eyes  and  the  fleshly  form?  Like  the  grass  all  have  perished,  all 
have  been  destroyed.  Come  ye,  therefore,  let  us  prostrate  ourselves  at 
the  feet  of  Christ  with  tears. 

A  great  weeping  and  wailing,  a  great  sighing  and  agony,  and  Hell  and 
destruction  is  the  departure  of  the  soul.  This  transitory  life  is  a  shadow 
unreal  and  an  illusive  dream ;  the  trouble  of  the  life  of  earth  is  a  phantasm 
importunate.  Let  us,  then,  flee  afar  from  every  earthly  sin,  that  we  may 
inherit  heavenly  things. 

As  we  gaze  on  the  dead  who  lieth  before  us,  let  us  all  accept  this  exam- 
ple of  our  own  last  hour.  For  he  vanisheth  from  earth  like  the  smoke; 
like  a  flower  he  is  faded;  like  the  grass  he  is  cut  down.  Swathed  in  a 
coarse  garment  he  is  concealed  in  the  earth.  As  we  leave  him  hidden 
from  sight,  let  us  beseech  Christ  that  he  will  give  unto  him  eternal  rest. 

Draw  nigh,  ye  descendants  of  Adam,  let  us  gaze  upon  him  who  is  laid 
low  in  the  earth,  made  after  our  own  image,  all  comeliness  stripped  off, 
dissolved  in  the  grave  by  decay,  by  worms  in  darkness  consumed,  and 
hidden  by  the  earth.  As  we  leave  him  hid  from  sight,  let  us  beseech 
Christ  that  he  will  give  unto  him  eternal  rest. 

When  the  soul  from  the  body  is  about  to  be  rent  with  violence  by 
Angels  dread,  it  forgetteth  all  its  kinsfolk  and  acquaintance,  and  is 
troubled  concerning  its  appearance  before  the  judgment  which  shall  come 
upon  the  things  of  vanity  and  much-toiling  flesh.  Come  ye,  then,  im- 
portuning'the  Judge,  let  us  implore  that  the  Lord  will  pardon  him  all  his 
deeds  which  he  hath  done. 

Come,  O  brethren,  let  us  gaze  into  the  grave  upon  the  dust  and  ashes 
from  which  we  are  made.  Whither  go  we  now?  What  are  we  become? 
Who  is  poor,  who  rich?  Who  is  the  master?  Who  a  freeman?  Are  not 
we'all  ashes?  The  beauty  of  the  countenance  is  mouldered,  and  Death 
hath  withered  up  all  the  flower  of  youth. 

Vanity  and  corruption,  of  a  truth,  are  all  the  illusions  and  the  inglori- 
ous things  of  life.  For  all  we  shall  pass  away:  all  we  shall  die,  kings  and 
princes,  judges  and  rulers,  rich  and  poor,  and  every  mortal  creature. 
For  now  they  who  were  erst  alive  are  cast  down  into  the  grave.  Where- 
fore, let  us  beseech  the  Lord  that  he  will  give  rest. 

Now  are  all  the  bodily  organs  seen  to  be  idle,  which  so  little  while  ago 
were  filled  with  motion ;  all  useless,  dead,  unconscious.  For  the  eyes  have 
withdrawn  inward,  the  feet  are  bound,  the  hands  lie  helpless,  and  the  ears 
withal;  the  tongue  is  imprisoned  in  silence,  committed  to  the  tomb.  Of 
a  verity,  all  mortal  things  are  vanity. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  thou  who  savest  those  who  fix  their 
hope  on  thee,  the  Mother  of  the  Sun  that  knoweth  no  setting,  O  Progene- 
trix  of  God ;  With  thy  prayers  entreat,  we  beseech  thee,  the  God  exceed- 
ing good,  that  unto  him  who  hath  now  been  translated,  he  will  give  re-

pose  where  the  souls  of  the  righteous  rest.  Manifest  him  an  heir  of 
divine  good  things  in  the  courts  of  the  Just,  unto  everlasting  memory, 
O  All-undefiled  One. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Tone  VI  As  ye  behold  me  lie  before  you  all  speechless  and  bereft  of 
breath,  weep  for  me,  0  friends  and  brethren,  O  kinsfolk  and  acquaintance. 
For  but  yesterday  I  talked  with  you,  and  suddenly  there  came  upon  me 
the  dread  hour  of  death.  But  come,  all  ye  who  loved  me,  and  kiss  me 
with  the  last  kiss.  For  nevermore  shall  I  walk  or  talk  with  you.  For  I 
go  hence  unto  the  Judge  with  whom  is  no  respect  of  persons.  For  slave 
and  master  stand  together  before  him,  king  and  warrior,  the  rich  and  the 
poor,  in  honour  equal.  For  according  to  his  deeds  shall  every  man  receive 
glory  or  be  put  to  shame.  But  I  beg  and  implore  you  all,  that  ye  will 
pray  without  ceasing  unto  Christ-God,  that  I  be  not  doomed  according 
to  my  sins,  unto  a  place  of  torment;  but  that  he  will  appoint  unto  me  a 
place  where  is  the  light  of  life. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

He  who  hath  been  translated  hence  hath  crossed  life's  ever-troubled 
sea,  and  hath  sailed  into  thy  haven  through  faith;  but  in  thy  tranquillity 
and  sweetness  immortal,  with  the  Saints  instructing  him,  give  rest,  O 
Christ,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant. 

Tone  IV.  To-day  is  fulfilled  the  all-praised  word  of  devout  David,  who 
said :  Man  is  like  the  grass,  his  days  are  as  the  flower  of  the  field  when  it  is 
withered.  For  erstwhile  we  beheld  him  living  and  speaking;  lo,  now  he 
lieth  dead,  motionless,  bereft  of  breath.  He  is  gone  forth,  and  hath  de- 
parted from  present  things,  thither  where  is  the  recompense  of  his  deeds; 
thither,  where  is  the  joy  of  all  the  Saints.  With  the  same  give  rest,  O 
God,  unto  him  that  is  gone  hence:  in  that  thou  art  merciful  and  lovest 
mankind. 

Tone  VIII.  Give  rest,  O  Lord  Almighty,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  in 
the  mansions  of  the  Just,  where  the  light  of  thy  countenance  shineth  upon 
all  that  are  worthy,  O  thou  who  alone  lovest  mankind. 

I  have  vanished  from  among  my  kin,  and  have  abandoned  the  residue 
of  my  life,  and  have  fled  unto  thee,  O  Lord :  Save  me. 

Through  the  prayers  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  give  peace  to  the  life  of 
us  who  cry  unto  thee:  O  Life-giver,  glory  to  thee! 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  {see  page  391),  and  the  rest  to  the  end  of 

the  Prayer:  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  by  his  divine  grace,  .  .     (See  page  392.) 

Then,  as  they  go  forth  to  the  grave,  the  Priests  sing  the  Theme-Songs  (Irmosi)  of  the 
Great  Canon  of  St.  Andrew  of  Crete. 

A  helper  and  protector  hath  revealed  himself  to  me  unto  salvation; 
He  is  my  God,  and  Him  will  I  glorify;  the  God  of  my  fathers,  and  Him 
will  I  exalt :  For  greatly  hath  he  glorified  himself. 

Hear,  ye  heavens;  I  will  proclaim  and  sing  praises  unto  Christ,  come 
in  the  flesh  through  a  Virgin. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS)     423 

On  the  rock  immovable  of  thy  statutes,  O  Christ,  establish  thou  ray 
thoughts. 

The  prophet  heard  of  thy  coming,  O  Lord,  and  was  affrighted,  that 
thou  shouldest  will  to  be  born  of  a  Virgin,  and  to  reveal  thyself  unto  men: 
and  he  said :  I  have  heard  thy  tidings,  and  was  sore  afraid :  Glory  to  thy 
might,  O  Lord. 

I  have  longed  for  thee  in  the  night-season,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind ; 
illumine  me,  1  beseech  thee,  and  guide  me  in  thy  commandments.  And 
teach  me,  O  Saviour,  to  do  thy  will. 

With  my  whole  heart  cried  I  unto  God,  rich  in  mercies,  and  he  heard 
me  from  the  nethermost  hell,  and  led  forth  my  life  from  corruption. 

We  have  sinned,  we  have  dealt  unlawfully,  we  have  wrought  evil  in  thy 
sight,  neither  have  we  observed,  neither  have  we  done  those  things  which 
thou  hast  commanded  us:  yet  cast  us  not  away  utterly,  O  God  of  our 
fathers. 

Him  whom  all  the  Hosts  of  heaven  glorify,  before  whom  tremble 
Cherubim  and  Seraphim,  praise  ye,  bless  ye,  and  magnify  forever,  every- 
thing that  hath  breath  and  every  creature. 

Passing  understanding  is  the  Nativity  of  seedless  conception,  incor- 
ruptible is  the  fruit  of  the  mother  unwedded;  for  the  birth  of  God  re- 
neweth  nature :  Wherefore  all  generations,  and  we  with  them,  right  glo- 
riously do  magnify  thee,  as  Bride  and  Mother  of  our  God. 

O  Holy  God,  .  .  Glory  now,  and  ever,  .  .  O  all-holy  Trinity,  .  . 
Lord,  have  mercy.  {Thrice.)  Glory  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  Our  Father, 
For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  .       In  the  place  of  thy  rest,  Thou  art 

the  God  who  didst  descend  into  Hell,  O  Only  Pure  and  Spotless 

Virgin,  .  .  {page  368).  And  the  Litany:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God: 
with  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  .  {page  369)  and  the  rest,  as  at  the 
Burial  of  Laymen.     {See  page  391.) 

With  this  difference:  That  in  the  Benediction,  and  in  the  "Eternal  memory,"  the 
name  of  the  Priest  is  mentioned.  The  Prayer  of  Absolution  is  read  by  the  Bishop 
{if  one  be  present) ,  or  by  the  Principal  Priest;  and  it  is  then  placed  in  the  hand  of 
the  dead  Priest  in  the  coffin  by  his  Confessor.

O  Thou  who,  with  wisdom  profound,  mercifully  orderest  all  things,  and 
givest  that  which  is  expedient  unto  all  men,  thou  Only  Creator:  Give 
rest,  O  Lord,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant  who  hath  fallen  asleep;  For  he 
(she)  hath  set  his  (her)  hope  on  thee,  our  Maker,  the  Author  of  our  being 
and  our  God. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

For  he  (she)  hath  set  his  (her)  hope  on  thee,  our  Maker,  the  Author  of

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

Then  Psalm  li.,  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  .  .     (See  page  380.) 

And  after  that  beginneth  the  Canon  for  the  Dead,  over  the  departed  child. 

Canticle  I.,  Tone  VIII. 
Theme-Song  (Irmos).  When  Israel  had  passed  through  the  water  as  it 
had  been  dry  land,  and  had  escaped  from  the  malice  of  the  Egyptians, 
they  cried:  Let  us  sing  praises  unto  our  deliverer  and  our  God. 
Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  O  Word  of  God,  who  didst  humble  thyself  even  unto  the 
flesh,  and  wast  graciously  pleased  to  become  a  babe,  yet  without  change: 

*  The  Order  for  the  Burial  of  a  Child  under  seven  years  of  age  differeth  from  that  of  Burial 
of  Adults,  inasmuch  as  it  is  celebrated  over  innocent,  sinless  beings. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  A  CHILD  425 

Ordain  thou  that  this  child  whom  thou  hast  accepted  may  be  received  into 
Abraham's  bosom,  we  beseech  thee. 

Thou  wast  beheld  a  little  child,  thou  who  existest  before  all  the  ages, 
and  forasmuch  as  thou  art  good,  unto  children  hast  promised  thy  king- 
dom :  Number  therein  this  child  here  present. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Thou  hast  taken  unto  thyself,  O  Christ  the  Saviour,  this  spotless  child, 
ere  he  (she)  had  been  tempted  of  earthly  pleasures,  bestowing  upon  him 
(her)  thine  eternal  good  things;  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  thou  who,  in  wise  inexpressible,  didst 
bear  the  Wisdom  and  Word  of  the  Father,  heal  thou  the  cruel  wound  of 
my  soul,  and  soothe  the  pang  of  my  heart. 

Canticle  III. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  O  Lord  Supreme  and  Creator  of  the  vault  of 
heaven,  and  Founder  of  the  Church,  establish  thou  me  in  thy  love,  O  thou 
who  alone  lovest  mankind ;  the  Summit  of  desire,  the  Confirmation  of  the 
faithful. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

O  Word  all-perfect,  who  as  perfect  child  didst  manifest  thyself,  thou 
hast  translated  unto  thyself  this  child  of  stature  unfulfilled.  Give  him 
(her)  rest  with  all  the  just  who  are  well-pleasing  unto  thee,  O  thou  who 
alone  lovest  mankind. 

This  uncorrupted  child,  whom  thou  hast  translated  through  thy  com- 
mand divine,  torn  hence  ere  he  (she)  had  tasted  the  sweets  of  earth,  show 
thou  forth  a  partaker  of  super-mundane  good  things,  we  beseech  thee,  O 
Beneficent  One. 

Glory  .     . 

A  partaker  of  heavenly  mansions,  and  of  radiant  rest,  and  of  the  holy 
Choir  of  the  Saints,  make  thou,  O  Lord,  this  child  most  pure,  whom  it 
hath  seemed  good  to  thee,  O  Saviour,  to  call  unto  thyself. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Bereft  of  all  things  I  flee  to  thy  sole 
shelter,  O  Lady  Most  Pure:  Succour  thou  me.    For  I  have  heaped  up  a 
treasure  of  iniquity,  and  am  all  filled  with  poverty  of  virtues. 
Then  the  Theme-Song:  O  Lord  Supreme  and  Creator  .  .  . 
Then  the  Priest  reciteth  the  following  Litany: 

Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  the  repose  of  this  blessed  child,  N.  And  that, 
according  to  his  word,  He  will  graciously  vouchsafe  unto  him  (her)  his 
heavenly  kingdom.

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  hast  promised  to  bestow  the  kingdom 
of  heaven  upon  them  that  have  been  born  of  water  and  of  the  Spirit,  and 
in  spotlessness  of  life  have  been  translated  unto  thee,  and  hast  said,  Suffer 
the  little  children  to  come  unto  me,  for  of  such  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven: 
We  humbly  entreat  thee  that  thou  wilt  give  unto  thy  servant,  the  spotless 
child,  X.,  now  departed  from  us,  the  inheritance  of  thy  kingdom,  accord- 
ing to  thine  unfailing  promise.  And  grant  that  we  may  continue  in  in- 
nocency  of  living,  and  make  a  Christian  ending  of  our  life,  and  attain  to 
an  abode  in  the  heavenly  mansions,  with  all  thy  Saints. 

For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life,  and  the  Repose  of  all  thy 
servants,  and  of  thy  servant,  this  child,  X.,  now  taken  from  us,  O  Christ 
our  God ;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who 
is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Hymn.  Of  a  truth,  all  things  are  vanity,  and  life  is  but  a  shadow  and 
a  dream.  For  in  vain  doth  every  one  who  is  born  of  earth  disquiet  him- 
self, as  saith  the  Scriptures.  When  we  have  acquired  the  world,  then  do 
лл*е  take  up  our  abode  in  the  grave,  where  kings  and  beggars  lie  down 
together  Wherefore,  O  Christ  our  God,  give  rest  to  thy  servant  departed 
this  life;  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Canticle  IV 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  I  have  heard  the  mystery  of  thy  dispensation, 
O  Lord,  and  have  considered  thy  works,  and  have  glorified  thy  divinity. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  Let  us  not  mourn  the  child,  but  rather  weep  heavily  for  our- 
selves who  sin  always;  that  we  may  be  delivered  from  Gehenna. 

Thou  hast  deprived  the  child  of  earthly  joys,  O  Master.  Grant  unto 
him  (her)  thy  heavenly  good  things ;  forasmuch  as  thou  art  he  who  judgeth 
righteously. 

Glory 

A  citizen  of  Paradise,  O  truly  blessed  child,  shall  he  make  thee  who 
hath  summoned  thee  from  earth,  and  numbereth  thee  with  the  company 
of  the  Saints. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  A  CHILD  427 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  All  we  who  are  illumined  know  thee, 
O  Birth-giver  of  God  most  pure.  For  thou  hast  borne  the  Sun  of  Right- 
eousness, O  Ever- Virgin  One. 

Canticle  V 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Wherefore  hast  thou  cast  me  away  from  thy 
countenance,  O  Light  which  knowest  no  setting?  And  why  hath  hostile 
darkness  encompassed  me,  the  wretched  one?  But  turn  thou  me  again,  and 
guide  thou  my  paths  in  the  light  of  thy  commandments,  I  beseech  thee. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  By  thy  righteous  judgment  hast  thou  mowed  down,  ere  like 
a  green  shoot  it  had  put  forth  buds,  the  child  whom  thou  has  called  to 
thyself,  O  Lord.  But  in  that  thou  hast  led  the  same  unto  the  mount  of 
blessings  everlasting,  implant  thou  him  (her)  firmly  there,  O  Word. 

The  sword  of  death  hath  come  and  cut  thee  off  like  a  tender  branch 
ere  thou  hadst  tasted  earthly  joys,  O  Blessed  One.  But  lo!  Christ  doth 
open  unto  thee  the  heavenly  gates,  numbering  thee  with  the  elect.  For 
he  is  full  of  loving-kindness. 

Glory 

Grieve  ye  not  for  me,  for  he  hath  ordained  nothing  worthy  of  grief. 
But  weep  ye  rather  always  for  yourselves  who  have  sinned  sore,  O  kin 
and  friends,  the  dead  child  crieth :  that  when  ye  shall  be  proved  ye  receive 
not  chastisement. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Of  myself  do  I  despair,  when  I  look 
upon  the  multitude  of  my  deeds.  But  when  I  take  thought  of  thee,  who 
beyond  understanding  didst  bear  the  Lord,  O  Mother  of  God,  I  am  re- 
freshed with  hope.    For  thee  alone  do  we  possess  as  our  Mediatrix- 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  I  will  pour  out  my  petition  unto  the  Lord,  and 
unto  him  will  I  proclaim  my  grief.  For  evil  hath  filled  my  soul,  and  my 
life  hath  drawn  nigh  unto  the  pit;  and  like  Jonah  will  I  pray:  Lead  me 
forth  from  corruption,  O  God. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  As  a  child  thou  wast  laid  in  a  manger,  and  didst  yield  thyself 
to  the  embrace  of  an  aged  man  who  had  begotten  babes  in  his  loins.  And 
ere  this  child  had  attained  unto  his  (her)  full  stature,  thou  has  translated 
him  (her)  into  life.     For  which  cause  we  glorify  thee  with  thanksgiving. 

Thou  didst  cry  unto  the  Apostles,  O  Word:  Suffer  the  little  children  to 
come  unto  me,  for  unto  such  as  are  like  unto  them  in  spirit  is  my  kingdom 
given.  Grant,  therefore,  thy  light  unto  the  child  who  hath  been  trans- 
lated unto  thee. 

Glory 

Thou  hast  despoiled  thy  child  of  earthly  good  things,  that  thou  mightest

manifest  him  {her)  a  partaker  of  thy  heavenly  good  things,  inasmuch  as 
he  (she)  hath  not  offended  against  thy  commands  divine.  Let  us  glorify 
the  depth  immeasurable  of  thy  providence,  O  Blessed  One. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thee  have  we  as  a  vast  wall  of  refuge, 
O  Maiden,  and  an  all-perfect  salvation  for  our  souls,  and  an  abiding-place 
in  sorrow;  and  in  thy  light  will  we  rejoice  evermore.  O  Lady,  save  us  now 
from  our  griefs  and  woes. 

Then  the  Theme-Song:  I  will  pour  out  my  petition     . 

Then  the  Priest  reciteth  the  Litany:  Again,  yet  again:  with  the  Prayer:  O  Lord  Jesus 
Christ  our  God,  and  the  Exclamation.     (See  page  425.) 

Then  is  sung  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  VIII. 

With  the  Saints  give  rest,  O  Christ,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  where 
there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  everlasting. 

The  Ikos. 

Thou  only  art  immortal,  who  hast  created  and  fashioned  man.  For 
out  of  the  earth  were  we  mortals  made,  and  unto  the  earth  shall  we  re- 
turn again,  as  thou  didst  command  when  thou  madest  me,  saying  unto 
me:  For  earth  thou  art,  and  unto  the  earth  shalt  thou  return.  Whither, 
also,  all  we  mortals  wend  our  way,  making  of  our  funeral  dirge  the  song: 
Alleluia. 

Also  the  following  Ikosi: 

Naught  is  more  pitiable  than  a  mother,  naught  more  wretched  than 
a  father;  for  their  affections  are  sore  distressed  when  they  send  their 
children  forth  before  them  to  the  grave.  Great,  also,  is  the  pang  of  their 
hearts  because  of  their  children,  and  yet  the  more  when  these  are  sweet 
of  speech,  as  they  call  to  mind  their  sayings  with  the  song:  Alleluia. 

Oft  do  they  beat  their  breasts  before  the  grave  and  say:  O  my  son,  and 
sweetest  child,  hearest  thou  not  what  thy  mother  crieth  unto  thee?  Be- 
hold, also,  the  womb  that  bare  thee.  Why  speakest  thou  not  with  us,  as 
thou  wert  wont  to  speak,  but  thus  boldest  thy  peace,  and  sayest  not  with 
us:  Alleluia. 

O  God,  O  God,  who  has  called  me  hence,  be  thou  the  consolation  of  my 
household  now;  for  a  great  affliction  hath  befallen  them.  For  all  hold 
their  gaze  fixed  steadfastly  on  me,  having  me  as  their  only-begotten  one. 
But  do  thou,  who  wast  born  of  a  Virgin  Mother,  refresh  the  bowels  of  my 
mother,  and  water  with  dew  the  heart  of  my  father,  even  with  this:  Alle- 
luia. 

Then  the  Collect-Hymn,  in  Tone  VIII. 

Wi+h  the  Saints  give  rest,  O  Christ,  to  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  where 
there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  everlasting. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  A  CHILD  429 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  The  Hebrew  Children  in  the  furnace  trod  boldly 
on  the  flames,  and  the  fire  was  transformed  into  dew  as  they  cried: 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God,  forevermore. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  Inscribe  thy  child  in  the  Book  of  the  Redeemed,  in  that  thou 
lovest  mankind,  O  Bountiful  One;  that,  rejoicing,  he  may  cry  aloud  to 
the  majesty  of  thy  glory:  Blessed  art  thou. 

With  the  radiant  light  of  thy  countenance  illumine  thou,  O  Word,  thy 
child  who,  in  the  faith,  hath  been  translated  unto  thee  in  unripe  age,  and 
singeth  unto  thee:  O  Lord  God,  blessed  art  thou. 

Glory 

A  cause  of  woe  doth  thy  going  hence  now  seem  to  those  who  love  thee ; 
but  of  a  surety  to  thee  a  cause  of  joy  and  gladness.  For  thou,  O  child, 
hast  inherited  life  unto  all  the  ages. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Behold,  O  Virgin,  the  affliction  which 
the  multitude  of  my  evil  deeds  hath  brought  upon  me;  and  ere  I  go 
hence,  give  me  refreshing  with  thy  maternal  prayers,  that  God  may  show 
mercy  upon  me. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  With  seven-fold  heat  did  the  Chaldsean  tyrant 
in  his  rage  cause  the  furnace  to  be  heated  for  the  Godly  Ones ;  but  when 
he  beheld  them  saved  by  a  better  power,  he  cried  aloud  unto  their  Maker 
and  Redeemer:  Ye  Children,  bless;  ye  Priests  sing  praises;  ye  People 
exalt  him  unto  all  the  ages. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  In  Abraham's  bosom,  in  the  mansions  of  rest,  where  abideth 
ever  the  joy  of  those  who  make  glad;  in  the  places  of  refreshing  where 
is  the  water  of  life,  may  Christ  establish  thee,  in  that  he  himself  became  a 
little  child  for  the  sake  of  us  who  continually  do  cry  unto  him :  Ye  Priests, 
sing  praises;  ye  People,  exalt  him  forevermore. 

Thy  going  hence  is,  of  a  truth,  the  all-sufficent  and  ever-memorable 
cause  of  our  grief  and  of  our  tears.  For  ere  thou  hadst  tasted  the  pleas- 
ant things  of  this  present  life,  thou  hast  left  the  earth,  and  thy  parents' 
bosom.  But  Abraham's  bosom  shall  receive  thee;  for  thou  art  but  a  little 
child,  and  hast  no  part  in  any  stain. 

Glory 

Why  mourn  ye  me,  the  child  translated  hence?  he  crieth  invisibly,  as 
dead  he  lieth.  There  is  no  cause  for  grief.  For  unto  children  who  have 
committed  no  deeds  worthy  of  tears  is  appointed  the  joy  of  all  the 
Righteous.  For  unto  Christ  they  sweetly  sing:  Ye  Priests,  sing  praises; 
ye  People  exalt  him  forevermore. 

Now,  and  ever,     .  . 


430  THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  A  CHILD 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Arise  to  my  succour,  O  Birth-giver  of 
God.  Receive  my  supplications,  and  deliver  me  from  condemnation 
dread,  from  rigorous  searching-out,  from  outer  darkness,  and  fire,  and 
from  gnashing  of  teeth;  from  the  spiteful  abuse  of  demons,  and  from 
every  distress,  O  Hope  of  the  hopeless,  O  Life  of  the  despairing. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  Heaven  was  affrighted,  and  the  ends  of  the  earth 
were  amazed:  For  God  revealed  himself  unto  men  in  the  flesh,  and  thy 
womb  became  more  spacious  than  the  heavens.  For  which  cause  the 
chieftains  of  men  and  of  Angels  do  glorify  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Refrain.  Give  rest  to  the  child,  O  Lord. 

Hymns.  O  Christ,  who  didst  become  a  little  child,  yet  without  change 
of  essence;  and  of  thine  own  good  will  didst  unite  thyself  unto  the  Cross; 
and  with  pity  didst  look  upon  the  maternal  sorrows  of  her  who  gave  thee 
birth:  Assuage  thou  the  sadness  and  sore  grief  of  the  faithful  parents  of 
the  dead  child :  that  unto  thy  majesty  we  may  sing  praises. 

O  King  of  all  men,  in  that  thou  hast  sent  from  on  high,  and  taken  this 
blessed  child,  like  a  pure  little  bird,  to  its  heavenly  nest,  thou  hast  saved 
this  soul  from  snares  of  many  kinds,  O  Lord,  and  hast  united  it  with  the 
spirits  of  the  righteous  who  enjoy  the  delights  of  thy  kingdom. 

Glory  .  . 

Thou  hast  bestowed  a  heavenly  abode,  O  Word  of  God,  upon  children 
who  have  wrought  no  evil :  for  thus  hath  it  seemed  good  in  thy  sight,  O 
Blessed  One.  With  the  same  number  thou  also  thy  creature,  the  child 
who  is  now  come  unto  thee.  Assuage  thou  the  grief  of  his  (her)  parents; 
forasmuch  as  thou  art  pitiful,  and  lovest  mankind. 

Now,  and  ever,     . 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  With  the  eye  of  the  heart  gazing  ever 
steadfastly  unto  thee,  who  makest  supplication  maternal  to  him  who  was 
born  of  thee,  I  implore  thee,  O  all-blameless  One:  Quench  thou  the  pas- 
sions of  my  soul;  move  me  betimes  to  penitence,  O  Virgin,  and  illumine 
me  with  thy  light. 

Then  the  Litany:  Again,  yet  again:  with  the  Prayer:  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God, 
.  .  .  and  the  Exclamation.     (See  page  425.)

Now  am  I  at  rest,  and  have  found  great  release ;  for  I  have  been  trans-

Lord.

And  straightway  the  Priest  shall  exclaim:

thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy

(.r  Cor.  xv.  39-46.)  Brethren :  All  flesh  is  not  the  same  flesh :  but  there  is 
one  kind  of  flesh  of  men,  another  flesh  of  beasts,  another  of  fishes,  and 
another  of  birds.  There  are  also  celestial  bodies,  and  bodies  terrestrial :  but 
the  glory  of  the  celestial  is  one,  and  the  glory  of  the  terrestrial  is  another. 
There  is  one  glory  of  the  sun,  and  another  glory  of  the  moon,  and  another 
glory  of  the  stars;  for  one  star  differeth  from  another  star  in  glory.  So 
also  is  the  resurrection  of  the  dead.  It  is  sown  in  corruption,  it  is  raised 
in  incorruption ;  it  is  sown  in  dishonour,  it  is  raised  in  glory:  it  is  sown 
in  weakness,  it  is  raised  in  power:  it  is  sown  a  natural  body,  it  is  raised  a 
spiritual  body.  There  is  a  natural  body,  and  there  is  a  spiritual  body. 
A.nd  so  it  is  written,  The  first  man  Adam  was  made  a  living  soul,  the 
last  Adam  was  made  a  quickening  spirit.

Priest.  Wisdom,  O  believers!  Let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel.  Peace 
be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  John. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

Priest.  Let  us  attend. 

{John  vi.  35-40.)  The  Lord  said  unto  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him: 
I  am  the  bread  of  life :  he  that  cometh  unto  me  shall  never  hunger,  and  he 
that  believeth  on  me  shall  never  thirst.  But  I  said  unto  you,  that  ye  also 
have  seen  me  and  believe  not.  All  that  the  Father  giveth  me  shall  come 
to  me:  and  him  that  cometh  unto  me,  I  will  in  no  wise  cast  out.  For  I 
came  down  from  heaven,  not  to  do  mine  own  will,  but  the  will  of  him  that 
sent  me.  And  this  is  the  Father's  will,  which  hath  sent  me,  that  of  all 
which  he  hath  given  me,  I  should  lose  nothing,  but  should  raise  it  up 
again  at  the  last  day. 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee,  who  hast  announced  the  good  tidings. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

And  straightway  the  last  kiss  is  given,  while  the  Choir  singeth  the  following  Stanzas 
(Sttkhiri) : 

Tone  VIII.  Who  would  not  weep,  my  child,  thy  lamentable  transla- 
tion from  this  life !  For  a  babe  immature  from  thy  mother's  arms,  like  a 
birdling  small,  now  hast  thou  flown  swiftly  hence,  and  hast  fled  unto  the 
Creator  of  all  men.  Who  would  not  wail,  O  child,  beholding  thy  rosy 
face  so  early  faded,  which  before  was  beautiful  as  the  crimson  lily  of  the 
field?  O,  who  would  not  wail,  my  child,  and  cry  aloud  with  weeping, 
because  of  thy  great  comeliness,  and  the  beauty  of  thy  pure  life?  For 
like  some  ship  that  leaveth  no  wake  behind,  with  equal  swiftness  hast 
thou  vanished  from  my  sight.  Come  ye,  my  friends,  my  kinsfolk,  and  my 
neighbours,  and  with  me  kiss  ye  him  {her)  whom  we  are  committing  to  the 
tomb. 

Death  is  a  release  for  babes;  for  they  are  not  accounted  sharers  in  life's 
evil,  and  have  attained  unto  rest  and  heavenly  gladness;  and  in  Abraham's 
bosom  they  rejoice,  and  now  with  choirs  divine  of  holy  children  they 
make  glad,  and  faithfully  exult:  because  from  sin's  corruption  pure  have 
they  escaped. 

Glory  .     . 

Tone  VI.  Painful  to  Adam  of  old  in  Eden  was  the  tasting  of  the  tree, 
vrhen  the  serpent  belched  forth  his  poison.  For  thereby  did  Death  uni- 
versal enter  in,  which  devoureth  man.  But  then  the  Master  came,  sub- 
dued the  dragon,  and  gave  us  rest.  For  which  cause  let  us  cry  aloud 
unto  him :  Spare,  O  Saviour,  and  give  rest  among  the  Saints  to  him  {her) 
whom  thou  hast  taken. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  Thou  who  art  the  Consolation  of

Then  the  Hymn. 

With  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dead  give  rest,  O  Saviour,  to  the  soul  of 
thy  servant,  preserving  it  unto  the  blessedness  which  is  with  thee,  O  thou 
who  lovest  mankind. 

Then  the  Litany:  Again,  yet  again,  .  .  .  (See  page  425.) 

Priest.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Then  the  Priest,  bowing  his  head,  readeth,  secretly,  this  Prayer:  O  Lord  Jesus 
Christ  our  God,  (See  page  426.) 

Aloud.  For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  .  .  .  (See  page  426.) 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Choir  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare  more 
glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest  God  the 
Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.)     Bless. 

And  the  Priest  bestoweth  the  Benediction. 

Do  thou  who  rose  again  from  the  dead,  and  hast  dominion  over  both 
the  quick  and  the  dead,  Christ  our  very  God,  through  the  prayers  of  thy 
most  holy  Mother,  and  of  all  thy  Saints;  establish  in  thy  holy  tabernacles 
the  soul  of  the  child,  N.,  who  hath  now  been  translated  from  us;  and 
number  him  (her)  among  the  Righteous :  Forasmuch  as  thou  art  good  and 
lovest  mankind. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  after  the  Benediction  the  Priest  saith: 

Eternal  be  thy  memory,  O  N.,  worthily-blessed  and  ever-memorable 
child! 

And  the  Choir  singeth:  Memory  eternal!  (Thrice.) 

Thereupon  the  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Priest.  O  Lord,  who  guardest  little  children  in  this  present  life,  and 
hast  prepared  for  them  in  the  life  which  is  to  come  a  spacious  place, 
even  Abraham's  bosom,  and  angelic  abodes  brightly  radiant  which  befit

their  purity,  wherein  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dwell:  Do  thou,  the 
same  Lord  Christ,  receive  the  soul  of  thy  servant,  the  child,  N.,  with 
peace.  For  thou  hast  said:  Suffer  the  little  children  to  come  unto  me, 
for  of  such  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory, 
honour  and  worship,  with  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  taking  up  the  body,  they  go  forth  to  the  grave,  preceded  by  the  Priest,  the  Deacon, 
and  the  Choir,  all  singing: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     {Thrice.) 

And  -when  the  body  hath  been  laid  in  the  grave,  the  Senior  Priest,  taking  the  shovel, 
scattereth  earth  into  the  grave,  saying: 

The  earth  is  the  Lord's,  and  the  fulness  thereof:  the  round  world,  and 
they  that  dwell  therein. 

And  so  they  depart,  giving  thanks  unto  God. 


THE  ORDER  FOR  THE  BURIAL  OF  THOSE  WHO 
DIE  AT  HOLY  EASTER,  AND  DURING  THE  WHOLE 
OF  THE  BRIGHT  WEEK* 

It  must  be  known  that  if  any  one  is  called  unto  God  at  Holy  Easter,  or  on  any  day  of 
the  Bright  Week,  up  to  St.  Thomas's  Sunday,  very  little  of  the  customary  Office  for 
the  Dead  is  sung,  because  of  the  majesty  and  honour  of  the  joyful  Feast  of  the 
Resurrection:  for  it  is  the  festival  of  joy  and  gladness,  not  of  lamentation.  And-  as 
all  who  have  died  in  the  risen  Christ,  in  the  hope  of  resurrection  and  of  life  eternal, 
have  been  taken  unto  God  through  Christ's  Resurrection  from  the  sorrowful  things  of 
this  world  to  things  joyful  and  blissful,  the  Church  proclaimeth  the  hymns  of 
Resurrection  over  these  dead.  And  by  a  few  fitting  hymns,  litanies  and  prayers  we 
bear  testimony  that  the  dead  person  hath  died  in  penitence;  but  if  he  hath  not  made 
satisfaction  for  his  sins,  they  are  remitted  to  him  through  the  prayers  of  the  Church, 
and  he  is  freed  from  detention. 

When  the  Priest  is  come,  with  his  assistants,  to  the  house  where  the  body  of  the  dead 
person  lieth,  and  hath  put  on  his  priestly  stole  and  chasuble,  and  hath  censed  the 
remains,  he  maketh  the  customary  beginning:  Blessed  is  our  God.  And  the  Choir 
chanteth:  Christ  is  risen  (see  page  226),  in  Tone  V.  And  the  Priest  saith  the 
customary  verses,  to  wit:  Let  God  arise  (see  page  226) :  and  the  rest.  And  when 
these  have  been  sung,  the  Priest  sprinkleth  the  body  of  the  dead  person  with  holy 
water;  as  also  his  coffin,  both  within  and  without.  And  the  dead  person  is  im- 
mediately laid  therein.  And  when  the  singing  is  finished,  the  Deacon  saith  the 
customary  litany  for  the  dead.  And  the  Priest  reciteth,  secretly,  the  Prayer:  0 
God  of  spirits,     .     (See  page  369.) 

After  the  Exclamation:  In  that  we  have  beheld  the  resurrection  of  Christ,  is  read, 
taking  up  the  remains  of  the  dead,  they  go  forth  to  the  Church,  the  Priest  leading, 
and  the  Deacon  and  all  the  Choir  and  the  laymen  following.  And  as  they  go,  the 
ecclesiastics  and  the  Choir  chant  the  Easter  Canon,  that  is  to  say:  The  Day  of 
Resurrection!  (see  page  227),  in  regular  order,  as  much  as  they  will,  until  the 
Church  is  reached. 

At  the  Church,  after  the  remains  have  been  set  down,  they  finish  the  Canon  which 
hath  been  begun,  the  Priest  censing  according  to  the  custom.  And  at  the  fourth 
Theme-Song  there  is  the  usual  Litany,  with  the  Prayer. 

Exclamation.   For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life,  .       (See  page  369.) 

Then:  When  they  who  with  the  Marys  came,  (See  page  228.) 

Then  the  fourth  Theme-Song  is  sang,  in  due  order.  After  the  sixth  Theme-Song, 
there  is  the  usual  Litany  for  the  dead,  with  the  Prayer. 

Exclamation.     For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life,  (See  page  369.) 

Then  the  Collect-Hymn:  With  the  Saints  give  rest,  And  the  Ikos:  Thou  only 

art  immortal,  (See  page  428.) 

And  in  place  of:  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  .  As  many  as  have  been  baptized 
into  Christ  have  put  on  Christ. 

The  Epistle  for  the  Day,  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles. 

*  The  full  text  of  the  litanies,  prayers  and  bymns  will  be  found  in  the  other  Burial  Orders 
and  in  the  Easter  Service.

Alleluia,  in  Tone  II. 

The  Gospel  for  the  first  Sunday. 

And  then:  In  that  we  have  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  Christ  (see  page  230):  and 
the  rest  of  the  Songs  of  the  Canon. 

And  when  the  Canon  is  completed,  the  Exapostildrion  is  read  or  sung:  After  that 
thou  hadst  fallen  asleep  in  the  Mesh,  (Twice.)     (See  page  233.) 

Then  is  sung:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord;  teach  me  thy  statutes.  The  company  of 
the  Angels  was  amazed,  (See  page  28.) 

Then  the  Easter  Canticles  (Stikhiri),  with  their  Verses.     (See  page  233.) 

Glory  .       now,  and  ever,  The  Day  of  Resurrection,  (Thrice.)     (See  page 

227.)     And:  Christ  is  risen  (Thrice) 

And  when  these  Canticles  have  been  sung,  there  is  the  customary  kissing  of  the  dead, 
as  they  say:  Christ  is  risen. 

And  after  the  Canticles,  the  usual  Litany  for  the  dead,  with  the  Prayer,  which  is  read 
aloud,  close  to  the  dead  person,  by  the  Bishop  or  Priest. 

Exclamation.     For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and  the  Life,  .  .  .  (See  page  369.) 

Then  the  customary  Benediction.     (See  page  391.) 

Then  the  concluding  Prayer:  May  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  .  .  .  (See  page 
392-) 

And  we  go  forth  to  the  grave,  bearing  the  body  of  the  dead  for  burial.  And  the  Priest, 
and  all  the  Choir,  going  before  the  remains,  chant:  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead, 
trampling  down  Death  by  death,  and  upon  those  in  the  tomb  bestowing  life. 

And  the  body  is  buried,  with  thanksgiving  and  joy,  all  things  having  been  done  and 
said  which  are  written  in  the  Burial  of  a  Layman. 

And  the  Hymn  (Tropdr)  having  been  sung:  Open,  O  earth,  and  receive  that  which 
*    was  made  from  thee. 


THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD  * 

(PANIKHIDl) 

The  Parastdsa,  that  is  to  say,  the  Great  Requiem  Service  (i )  for  all  our  fathers  and 
brethren  who  have  fallen  asleep  in  the  Lord,  and  for  all  Orthodox  Christians  de- 
parted this  life. 

{And  the  Office  for  Orthodox  Warriors,  who  have  died  in  battle  for  the  Faith  and  the 
Fatherland;  celebrated  on  August  29  {September  11,  N.  S.).) 

The  Priest,  vested  in  his  stole  and  chasuble,  and  the  deacon  in  his  dalmatic,  come 
forth  from  the  sanctuary  to  the  porch,  preceded  by  a  Reader  bearing  a  light.  And 
they  stand  in  their  wonted  places,  on  either  side  of  a  table,  upon  which  is  a  dish  of 
koliva.  (2)

us.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  .       now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the

and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  {Three 
reverences.) 

Psalm  xci. 

Whoso  dwelleth  under  the  defence  of  the  most  High,  shall  abide  under 
the  shadow  of  the  Almighty.  I  will  say  unto  the  Lord,  Thou  art  my  hope, 
and  my  strong  hold;  my  God,  in  him  will  I  trust.  For  he  shall  deliver 
thee  from  the  snare  of  the  hunter,  and  from  the  noisome  pestilence.  He 
shall  defend  thee  under  his  wings,  and  thou  shalt  be  safe  under  his  feath- 
ers; his  faithfulness  and  truth  shall  be  thy  shield  and  buckler.  Thou 
shalt  not  be  afraid  for  any  terror  by  night,  nor  for  the  arrow  that  fiieth 
by  day;  for  the  pestilence  that  walketh  in  darkness,  nor  for  the  sickness 
that  destroyeth  in  the  noon-day  A  thousand  shall  fall  beside  thee,  and 
ten  thousand  at  thy  right  hand;  but  it  shall  not  come  nigh  thee.  Yea, 
with  thine  eyes  shalt  thou  behold,  and  see  the  reward  of  the  ungodly. 
For  thou,  Lord,  art  my  hope;  thou  hast  set  thine  house  of  defence  very 
high.  There  shall  no  evil  happen  unto  thee,  neither  shall  any  plague 
come  nigh  thy  dwelling.  For  he  shall  give  his  angels  charge  over  thee, 
to  keep  thee  in  all  thy  ways.  They  shall  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  that 
thou  hurt  not  thy  foot  against  a  stone.  Thou  shalt  go  upon  the  lion  and 
adder;  the  young  lion  and  the  dragon  shalt  thou  tread  under  thy  feet. 
Because  he  hath  set  his  love  upon  me,  therefore  will  I  deliver  him;  I  will 
set  him  up,  because  he  hath  known  my  Name.  He  shall  call  upon  me, 
and  I  will  hear  him;  yea,  I  am  with  him  in  trouble;  I  will  deliver  him, 
and  bring  him  to  honour.  With  long  life  will  I  satisfy  him,  and  show 
him  my  salvation. 

Glory     .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  .  Alleluia.    {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  thee,  O  God.    {Thrice.) 

Then  the  Deacon,  taking  the  censer  from  the  Priest,  censeth  before  the  table,  reciting 
the  Great  Litany. 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.

Canticle  I. 

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  When  Israel  had  passed  through  the  water  as 
it  had  been  dry  land,  and  had  escaped  from  the  malice  of  the  Egyptians,

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 
Thou  didst  conceive  the  Word  of  the  Father,  uniting  Its  essence  to  the 
flesh  which  is  from  thee,  O  Virgin  all-undenled,  triumphing  over  Hell 
with  might  divine.     Beseech  thou  the  Same  that  he  will  give  life  unto 
him  {her.  them)  who  hath  {have)  died  in  the  faith. 

Canticle  III. 

Theme-Song  {Irmos).  O  Master  and  Creator  of  the  vault  of  heaven, 
and  Founder  of  the  Church,  establish  thou  me  in  thy  love,  O  Summit 
of  desires,  O  Confirmation  of  the  faithful,  who  alone  lovest  mankind. 

Hymns.  Having  washed  away  the  fall  of  our  forefather  of  old  by 
baptism  and  a  new  birth,  and  having  been  sprinkled  with  streams  of 
your  blood,  ye  shall  reign  in  Christ,  O  Blessed  Ones. 

Thou  who,  of  thine  own  good  will,  didst  lay  thyself  dead  in  the  grave, 
and  didst  call  forth  those  who  lay  in  the  graves,  O  Saviour:  Be  graciously 
pleased  to  establish  him  {her,  them)  whom  thou  hast  taken  from  us.  in 
the  mansions  of  thy  Righteous  Ones. 

Glory 

Thou  who  art  entreated  of  thy  loving-kindness  divine,  and  who, 
instructed  by  thy  dual  nature,  art  moved  to  mercy,  O  Master:  Grant 
remission  of  his  {her,  their)  sins  unto  thy  servant(Y),  O  Saviour;  and  give 
him  {her,  them)  rest. 

Now,  and  ever, 

Intercede,  we  beseech  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  with  him  who  was 
incarnate  in  thy  womb,  and  was  made  man:  and  who,  especially,  in 
that  he  alone  loveth  mankind,  doth  save  man  from  the  gates  of  death; 
that  he  will  grant  repose  with  his  saints  to  the  soul(s)  of  his  servant(s) 
who  hath  {who  have)  fallen  asleep. 

Then  the  Theme-Song  is  repeated,  and  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany:  Again,  yet  again, 
{See  page  441.)      While  the  Priest  saith,  secretly,  the  Prayer:  0  God  of

thou  art  the  Resurrection,  .       {See  page  439.) 

Then  the  Sitting-Hymn  {Syeddlen),  in  Tone  VI. 

Of  a  truth,  all  things  are  vanity,  and  life  is  but  a  shadow  and  a  dream. 
For  in  vain  doth  every  one  who  is  born  of  earth  disquiet  himself,  as, saith 
the  Scriptures.  When  we  have  acquired  the  world,  then  do  we  take  up 
our  abode  in  the  grave,  where  kings  and  beggars  lie  down  together. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ  our  God,  give  rest  to  thy  servant(s)  departed  this 
life;  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

O  all-holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  forsake  me  not  all  the  days  of  my  life,

Canticle  IV 

Theme-Song.  Thou  art  my  fortress,  O  Lord,  and  thou  art  my  strength: 
Thou  art  my  God,  thou  art  my  joy.  Thou  didst  not  leave  the  bosom  of 
the  Father,  yet  hast  thou  visited  our  wretchedness.  Wherefore,  with  the 
prophet  Habakkuk  cry  I  unto  thee:  Glory  to -thy  might,  O  thou  who 
lovest  mankind. 

Hymns.  May  thy  Martyrs  divine,  O  Lord,  who  with  patience  have 
endured  every  manner  of  torment,  radiantly  behold  and  in  heaven  receive 
the  brightness  of  thy  glory,  as  they  sing  unto  thee,  O  Christ:  Glory  to 
thy  might,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

Many  are  thy  mansions,  O  Saviour,  meted  out  in  inheritance  unto  all 
men  according  to  their  merits.  Wherefore,  O  Bountiful  One,  graciously 
vouchsafe  to  fill  the  same  with  those  who  have  departed  this  life  in  thy 
faith,  devoutly  crying  unto  thee:  Glory  to  thy  might,  O  thou  who  lovest 
mankind. 

Glory 

As  a  man  like  unto  us  hast  thou  revealed  thyself,  O  Immortal  One; 
and  like  unto  all  men  hast  thou  suffered  death,  and  hast  shown  us  the  way 
of  life.  Unto  him  {her,  them)  who  hath  {have)  departed  this  life  grant 
remission  of  his  {her,  their)  sins :  forasmuch  as  thou  lovest  mankind,  and  as 
Master  supreme  bestowest  gifts  and  givest  participation  in  the  light. 

Now,  and  ever,     .  . 

Thou  art  the  boast  of  the  faithful,  O  Un wedded  One;  thou  art  the 
Intercessor,  and  the  Refuge  of  Christians,  a  Wall  of  defence  and  a 
Stronghold.  Thou  bearest  petitions  to  thy  Son,  O  All-undefiled  One, 
and  savest  from  adversity  those  who,  with  faith  and  love,  acknowledge 
thee  to  be  the  pure  Birth-giver  of  God.  Entreat  thou  now  the  Same  that 
unto  this  person  who  hath  {these  persons  who  have)  departed  this  life  in 
the  faith,  he  will  grant  rest  with  the  Saints. 

Canticle  V 

Theme-Song.  Why  hast  thou  cast  me  away  from  thy  countenance,  O 
Light  which  knowest  no  setting,  and  why  hath  strange  darkness  covered 
me,  the  accursed  one?  But  turn  thou  me,  and  guide  my  paths  in  the  light 
of  thy  commandments,  I  beseech  thee. 

Hymns.  Mercifully  grant  thy  glory  ineffable,  and  thy  blessedness 
which  words  cannot  express,  in  the  mansions  of  the  Saints,  where  fair 
is  the  voice  of  those  who  keep  high  festival,  unto  him  {her,  them)  who 
hath  {have)  departed  hence;  recompensing  him  {her,  them)  unto  the  life 
that  knoweth  no  passion,  O  thou  who  alone  lovest  mankind.

Where  the  Angelic  hosts,  where  the  assembly  of  the  Righteous  rejoice, 
in  the  bosom  of  Abraham,  grant  an  abode  to  thy  servant^),  O  Saviour; 
and  graciously  vouchsafe  that  with  boldness  he  {she,  they)  may  stand 
before  thy  throne  dread  and  divine,  O  Compassionate  One. 

Glory  .     . 

As  purification  and  righteousness  and  deliverance  hast  thou  revealed 
thyself  unto  us;  and  by  thy  wounds  hast  thou  healed  our  infirmities. 
Wherefore,  O  Bountiful  One,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  gracious,  establish 
in  the  delights  of  Paradise  him  (her)  who  hath  (those  who  have)  departed 
hence. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Mercifully,  O  Merciful  One,  didst  thou  accept  the  stature  of  mankind ; 
and  having  endued  flesh  in  a  Virgin's  womb,  inspired  by  the  word,  and 
having  thereby  overthrown  Death,  thou  givest  life  unto  the  faithful. 
Wherefore,  through  the  intercessions  of  her  who  bare  thee,  grant  thou 
rest  with  the  Saints  unto  him  (her,  those)  who  hath  (have)  fallen  asleep. 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song.  Purge  me,  O  Saviour,  for  mine  iniquities  are  manifold; 
and  lead  me  forth  from  the  abyss  of  evil,  I  beseech  thee:  For  I  have  cried 
unto  thee.     And  hear  me,  O  God  of  my  salvation. 

Thy  Martyrs,  O  Christ,  endured  many  pains,  being  wounded  in  soul 
by  the  love  of  thee,  O  Holy  One,  and  desiring  thy  glory  everlasting,  and 
thy  sweet  communion.  Wherefore,  through  their  prayers,  grant  repose 
unto  the  soul (s)  of  him  (her,  them)  who  hath  (have)  fallen  asleep. 

Thou  didst  rend  the  belly  of  the  enemy  by  death,  O  Saviour,  and  didst 
raise  again  all  those  who  were  held  captive  therein,  bestowing  life  upon 
them.  Grant  the  same  also  unto  him  (her,  them)  who  is  (are)  gone  from 
us,  O  Beneficent  One. 

Glory     .  . 

From  the  tears  and  the  sighing  which  are  in  Hell  deliver  thy  servant(s), 
0  Saviour :  For  thou  alone  art  of  tender  mercy,  and  hast  wiped  away  all 
tears  from  the  faces  of  all  those  who,  with  faith,  do  bless  thee. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

He  who  is  the  Creator  of  all  Nature  doth  beget  in  thy  womb :  he  who 
is  full,  in  that  he  is  God,  doth  empty  himself,  O  All-undefiled  One.  The 
Only  Immortal  One  dieth  the  death  for  the  salvation  of  all  men,  and 
giveth  life  unto  those  who  die  in  the  faith. 

Purge  me,  O  Saviour  .  .  . 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany:  Again,  yet  again,  .     .  (See  page  441.)     While 
the  Priest  saith,  secretly,  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  .       (see  page  439) ;  and 
the  Fifth  Priest  saith,  aloud,  the  Exclamation:  For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,

where  there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  ever- 
lasting. 

The  Ikos. 

Thou  only  art  immortal,  who  hast  created  and  fashioned  man.  For 
out  of  the  earth  were  we  mortals  made,  and  unto  the  earth  shall  we 
return  again,  as  thou  didst  command  when  thou  madest  me,  saying  unto 
me:  For  earth  thou  art,  and  unto  the  earth  shalt  thou  return.  Whither 
also  all  we  mortals  wend  our  way,  making  of  our  funeral  dirge  the  song : 
Alleluia. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song.  The  Hebrew  Children  in  the  furnace  trod  boldly  upon 
the  flames,  and  the  fire  was  transmuted  into  dew  as  they  sang:  Blessed 
art  thou,  O  Lord  God,  forevermore. 

Hymns.  All  the  desire  of  the  Martyrs  reached  out  unto  the  only  Lord, 
in  love  united  unto  him,  and  singing:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God, 
forevermore. 

O  thou  who  givest  unto  those  who  have  departed  this  life  in  faith  the 
brightness  of  thy  kingdom  divine,  grant  also  the  robe  of  incorruption 
unto  those  who  cry  aloud:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God,  forever- 
more. 

Glory  .  . . 

Fill  with  joy  and  gladness  thy  servant(s)  whom  thou  hast  taken  from 
this  life,  O  Bountiful  One,  who  hast  enabled  him  (her,  them)  to  call  upon 
thee,  and  to  sing:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God,  forevermore. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Annulling  the  curse  of  Eve,  thou  didst  take  up  thine  abode  in  a  Virgin 
undefiled,  pouring  forth  a  fountain  of  blessing  upon  those  who  cry  aloud: 
Blessed,  O  most  holy  One,  is  the  fruit  of  thy  womb. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song.  The  Three  Children  obeyed  not  when  the  instruments 
of  music  sounded  in  harmony,  and  thousands  numberless  of  people 
bowed  down  before  the  image  on  Dura's  plain ;  but  praised  and  magnified 
the  Lord  unto  all  the  ages. 

Hymns.  The  Martyrs  true,  having  passed  through  earthly  feats  of 
might  and  received  heavenly  crowns,  cry  aloud  unto  thee  unceasingly: 
Praise  ye  the  Lord,  and  magnify  him  unto  all  the  ages. 

When  thou  hadst  descended  into  the  nethermost  pit,  thou  didst  raise 
again,  through  thy  life-giving  palm,  those  who  abode  in  the  grave. 
Grant  rest,  also,  by  the  same,  we  beseech  thee,  unto  thy  servant(s)  who 
before  us  hath  (have)  fallen  asleep  in  the  faith,  O  Bountiful  One. 

Let  us  praise  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Lord. 

Forasmuch  as  thou  art  the  Fountain  of  Life  everflowing  and  a  stream 
of  sweetest  pleasures,  grant  that  thy  servant(s)  who  hath  (have)  been 


THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD  447 

translated  to  thy  presence  may  devoutly  praise  and  magnify  thee  unto 
all  the  ages. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

O  Mary,  Virgin,  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  didst  bear  God  the  Saviour, 
as  man,  in  the  flesh:  Save  thou  those  who,  with  faith,  do  laud  thy  birth- 
giving,  and  extol  thee  throughout  all  the  ages. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song.  Every  ear  hath  been  amazed  at  the  unutterable  con- 
descension of  God;  for  of  his  own  good  will,  the  Most  High  hath  con- 
descended even  unto  the  flesh,  becoming  man  by  a  Virgin's  womb.  For 
which  cause  we  faithful  do  extol  the  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Hymns.  The  Martyrs  of  Christ,  having  a  stronghold  impregnable  and 
invincible,  brought  to  naught  the  godless  commands  of  their  tormentors; 
and  while  yet  in  the  flesh  were  visibly  granted  the  kingdom  of  heaven, 
being  illumined  by  the  beams  of  the  Trinity  who  is  all-worthy  of  praise. 

Hell  the  bitter  was  destroyed  when  thou  didst  destroy  it,  O  Thou  who 
lovest  mankind,  when  thou  didst  die,  and  didst  raise  from  the  dead 
those  who,  throughout  all  the  ages,  had  lain  asleep  therein.  But  do 
thou  now,  also,  mercifully  grant  unto  him  {her,  them)  who  is  {are)  come 
unto  thee,  in  that  thou  art  gracious,  thy  light  which  knoweth  no  setting, 
O  Tenderly-loving  One. 

Glory     .  . 

Thou  art  all  sweetness,  O  Saviour;  thou  art  all  desire  and  love,  in  very 
truth  inexhaustible;  thou  art  all  goodness  unspeakable.  Wherefore 
deign  thou  to  admit  him  {her,  those)  who  hath  {have)  now  appeared 
before  thee  to  delight  in  thy  beauty;  and  grant  thou  unto  him  {her,  them) 
thy  goodness  divine. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Save  me,  O  Mother  of  God,  who  hast  borne  Christ  my  Saviour,  both 
God  and  man,  two  in  nature  but  not  in  essence,  the  Only-begotten  of 
the  Father  and  of  thee,  the  First-born  of  all  created  beings.  And  for- 
asmuch as  thou  art  the  Mother  who  loveth  mankind,  entreat  thou  him 
that  he  will  grant  unto  him  {her,  them)  who  hath  {have)  departed  this 
life  repose  with  his  Saints. 

And  after  the  Ninth  Canticle  the  Priest  saith: 
The  Birth-giver  of  God  and  Mother  of  the  world  let  us  magnify  in  song. 
Choir.  The  spirits  and  souls  of  the  righteous  bless  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Theme-Song:  Every  ear  hath  been  amazed,  O  Holy  God,  Holy 
Mighty,  and  the  rest.  {See  page  437.)  Exclamation.  The  Priest.  For 
thine  is  the  kingdom,     .  . 

Then  the  Hymns,  in  Tone  IV. 
With  the  souls  of  the  righteous  dead,  give  rest,  O  Saviour,  to  the

which  is  with  thee,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind. 

In  the  place  of  thy  rest,  O  Lord,  where  all  thy  Saints  repose,  give  rest 
also  unto  the  soul (s)  of  thy  servant 0);  for  thou  only  lovest  mankind. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Thou  art  the  God  who  descended  into  Hell,  and  loosed  the  bonds  of 
the  captives:  Do  thou  give  rest  also  to  the  souK»  of  thy  servant^). 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God.  O  Virgin  alone  Pure  and  Undefiled, 
who  without  seed  didst  bring  forth  God,  pray  thou  that  his  {her)  soul 

{their  souls)  may  be  saved. 

Then  the  Litany. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  beseech 
thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Again  we  pray  for  the  repose  of  the  soul  of  N.  {NN.),  the  servant!» 
of  God,  departed  this  life,  and  that  he  {she,  they)  may  be  pardoned  all  his 
{her,  their)  sins,  both  voluntary  and  involuntary.    1$ 

That  the  Lord  God  will  establish  his  {her)  soul  {their  souls)  where  the 
Just  repose.    Ц 

The  mercies  of  God,  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  remission  of  his 
{her,  their)  sins,  let  us  ask  of  Christ,  our  King  immortal  and  our  God. 

Choir.  Grant  it,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Priest  saith,  aloud,  the  Prayer:  O  God  of  spirits,  .  .     {See  page  439.) 

And  the  Senior  Priest  maketh  the  Exclamation:  For  thou  art  the  Resurrection,  and 
the  Life,         see  page  439 ,  or  exclamation  for  Warriors;  see  page  440. 

A  Priest  or  the  Deacon  saith:  Wisdom ! 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Senior  Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  our  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.)     Bless. 

The  Benediction. 
Priest.  May  he  who  rose  again  from  the  dead,  Christ  our  true  God, 
through  the  prayers  of  his  all-pure  Mother;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and 
all-laudable  Apostles;  of  our  holy  and  God-bearing  Fathers,  and  of  all 
the  Saints,  establish  in  the  mansions  of  the  righteous  the  soul  {s)  of  his 
servant(s),  N  {NN.),  who  hath  {have)  been  taken  from  us  {or  the  souls

{her,  them)  with  the  Just;  and  have  mercy  upon  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is 
good  and  loveth  mankind. 

And  after  the  Benediction  the  Deacon  proclaimeth: 
Give  rest  eternal  in  blessed  falling  asleep,  O  Lord,  to  the  soul (s)  01 
thy  servant(V)  N.  (NN.),  departed  this  life  (or  of  his  servants,  the  Ortho-

O  Christ,  thou  didst  raise  up  again  with  thee  all  those  who  were  dead. 
Give  rest,  also,  O  Saviour,  to  those  who  have  been  translated  from  among 
us,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  bountiful. 

There  is  none  without  sin,  save  only  thee,  O  Master.  Wherefore

THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD  451 

Upon  thee,  O  Saviour,  did  they  set  their  hope  who  have  suffered  for 
thy  Holy  Church  and  the  Fatherland,  and  now  have  departed  from  us. 
Be  thou  bountiful  unto  them,  O  Lord,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  a  very  merci- 
ful God. 

Glory  .  .  . 

Illumine  thou,  O  thrice-holy  and  praised  Lord,  us  who  entreat  thee 
that  we  may  receive  thy  heavenly  peace.  And  establish  thou  in  the 
abodes  of  peace  the  souls  of  those  who  have  departed  from  things  tem-

Now,  and  ever,     . 

Entreat  thou  thy  Son,  O  Lady,  that  he  will  deliver  the  dead  from 
condemnation  to  stand  at  his  left  hand :  For  thou  art  the  Mother  of 
our  Saviour  and  our  God. 

Canticle  VI. 

Theme-Song.  I  will  pour  out  my  petition  unto  the  Lord,  and  unto 
him  will  I  confide  my  grief.  For  my  soul  is  filled  with  sorrow,  and  my 
life  hath  drawn  nigh  unto  Hell;  and  like  unto  Jonah  will  I  pray:  Lead 
thou  me  forth  from  corruption,  O  God. 

Hymns.  Thou  didst  overthrow  Hell,  O  Lord;  thou  didst  raise  up 
those  who  lay  dead  from  all  the  ages.  Those  who  have  died  for  thy 
Holy  Church  establish  thou  in  Abraham's  bosom,  O  Lord,  remitting  all 
their  transgressions;  forasmuch  as  thou  art  of  tender  compassion. 

If  we  have  sinned,  O  God,  against  the  commandment  which  thou 
gavest  us,  and  have  become  subject  unto  death,  nevertheless  do  thou, 
the  God  who  didst  descend  into  the  grave,  and  hast  raised  up  thence 
the  souls  of  all  the  ages,  revive  us  not  unto  torment,  but  unto  rest.  O 
Lord,  those  who  have  died  for  thy  Holy  Church  and  the  Fatherland 
cry  unto  thee  through  us,  O  thou  who  art  full  of  mercy. 

Glory 

We  entreat  thee,  O  Father,  who  art  from  everlasting,  and  O  Son  and 
O  Holy  Spirit,  reject  thou  not  into  the  abyss  of  Hell  the  souls  of  those 
who  were  infected  by  the  plague  of  the  soul-attainting  world,  and  now 
are  come  unto  thee,  the  Creator,  O  God  our  Saviour. 

Now,  and  ever, 

From  heaven  did  Christ  our  God  descend  upon  thee,  O  most  Pure 
One,  like  the  dew  upon  the  fleece,  slaking  the  thirst  of  all  the  world,  and 
drying  up  every  godless  water-spring,  and  flooding  the  whole  earth  with 
his  wisdom,  O  Ever-virgin  One.  Entreat  thou  him  that  unto  the  souls 
of  thy  servants  who  have  suffered  death  he  will  give  rest. 

Theme-Song:  I  will  pour  out  my  petition    .     ,  the  Litany  (see  page  441),  with  the 
Prayer  and  Exclamation.     (See  page  439.) 

The  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  in  Tone  VIII. 
With  the  Saints  give  rest,  O  Christ,  to  the  soul(s)  of  thy  servant (5), 
where  there  is  neither  sickness,  nor  sorrow,  nor  sighing,  but  life  ever- 
lasting. 


452  THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD 

The  Ikos. 
Thou  only  art  immortal,  who  hast  created  and  fashioned  man.  For 
out  of  the  earth  were  we  mortals  made,  and  unto  the  earth  shall  we 
return  again,  as  thou  didst  command  when  thou  madest  us,  saying  unto 
me:  For  earth  thou  art,  and  unto  earth  shalt  thou  return.  Whither,  also, 
all  we  mortals  wend  our  way,  making  of  our  funeral  dirge  the  song: 

Alleluia. 

Canticle  VII. 

Theme-Song.  The  Holy  Children,  sprung  from  the  Jews  of  yore,  in 
Babylon,  through  the  faith  of  the  Trinity  did  trample  under  foot  the 
fiery  furnace,  singing:  O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art  thou. 

Hymns.  O  Master,  Christ  our  God,  when  thou  shalt  come  to  judge 
the  world,  spare  thou  the  souls  of  thy  servants  who  have  suffered  for 
thy  Holy  Church  and  the  Fatherland,  and  whom  thou  hast  taken  from 
us,  crying:  O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art  thou. 

In  the  pastures  of  Paradise,  where  abide  the  souls  of  the  Righteous 
who  have  served  thee,  number  thou  also,  with  them,  O  Christ,  the  souls 
of  thy  servants  who  sing  unto  thee:  O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art 
thou. 

Glory  .  .  . 

O  thou  who  didst  save  the  three  Hebrew  Children  from  the  fire,  and  in 
Three  Persons  art  exalted,  deliver  from  fire  eternal  the  dead  who  in  faith 
do  laud  thee:  O  God  of  our  fathers,  blessed  art  thou. 

Now,  and  ever,  .  .  . 

Isaiah  called  thee  the  Sceptre,  O  most  Pure  One;  and  Daniel,  the 
Mount  Uncloven ;  and  Ezekiel,  the  Door  whence  issued  forth  Christ.  And 
we  also,  naming  thee  the  true  Mother  of  God,  do  magnify  thee. 

Canticle  VIII. 

Theme-Song.  With  a  furnace  seven  times  heated  did  the  Chaldsean  tor- 
mentor fiercely  scorn  the  God-fearing  Ones ;  but  when  he  beheld  the  same 
saved  by  a  better  power,  unto  their  Maker  and  Deliverer  he  cried:  Ye 
Children,  bless;  ye  Priests,  sing  praises;  ye  People,  magnify  forevermore. 

Hymns.  They  who  have  finished  their  course,  and  have  fled  for  refuge 
unto  thee,  O  Lord,  and  have  suffered  for  thy  Holy  Church,  now  cry  aloud 
unto  thee:  Pardon  our  iniquities,  O  Christ  our  God,  and  condemn  not, 
when  thou  shalt  come  to  judge  all  men,  us  who  with  faith  have  cried  unto 
thee:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  praise  ye  the  Lord  and  magnify  him  for- 
evermore. 

Establish  thou,  O  Lord,  those  who  have  borne  upon  their  shoulders, 
though  it  be  not  always,  thy  yoke  and  thy  burden  which  are  light.  Yea, 
in  the  place  of  thy  Saints,  establish  thou  the  souls  of  those  who  sing 
praises  unto  thee,  O  Christ  our  God:  Ye  Children,  bless;  ye  Priests,  sing 
praises;  ye  People,  magnify  forevermore. 

Let  us  bless  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Lord. 


THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD  453 

O  holy  Trinity,  who  art  from  everlasting,  God  the  Father,  the  Son,  and 
the  Holy  Spirit,  in  the  company  of  the  blessed  number  thou  the  souls 
of  thy  servants  who  have  suffered;  and  deliver  them  from  fire  eternal, 
that  they  may  laud  thee,  and  sing  praises  unto  thee  forever.  Ye  Chil- 
dren, bless;  ye  Priests,  sing  praises;  ye  People,  magnify  forevermore. 

Now,  and  ever, 

The  company  of  the  prophets  foretold  thee,  O  Virgin :  for  beholding  thee 
with  vision  perspicacious,  one  called  thee  the  Sceptre;  another,  the  Door 
of  the  East;  another,  the  Mount  Uncloven  of  Man.  And  we,  also,  con- 
fess thee  to  be  the  true  Mother  of  the  Lord,  who  hast  borne  the  God  of  all 
men.  Beseech  thou  him  that  unto  those  who  have  suffered  in  all  the  ages 
he  will  give  rest. 

Canticle  IX. 

Theme-Song.  The  heavens  marvelled  thereat,  and  the  ends  of  the  earth 
were  amazed,  when  God  manifested  to  men  himself  incarnate;  and  thy 
womb  was  more  spacious  than  the  heavens.  For  which  cause  the  chief- 
tains of  Angels  and  of  men  do  magnify  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Hymns.  O  Jesus,  God  and  Saviour,  thou  didst  take  upon  thee  Adam's 
sin,  and  didst  taste  of  death,  that  thou  mightest  deliver  men  therefrom, 
O  Compassionate  One.  For  which  cause  we  beseech  thee,  O  Merciful 
One:  In  the  courts  of  thy  Saints  give  rest  unto  those  who  have  suffered, 
in  that  thou  art  gracious:  For  thou  only  art  good,  and  lovest  mankind. 

There  is  none  among  men  who  sinneth  not,  O  Compassionate  One, 
save  only  thee,  O  Jesus  Christ,  who  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  whole 
world.  Wherefore,  after  that  thou  hast  purged  thy  servants  from  their 
iniquities,  establish  thou  them  in  the  courts  of  thy  Saints :  For  thou  art 
the  Life,  and  the  Rest,  and  the  Light,  ana  the  Joy  of  all  who  are  well- 
pleasing  in  thy  sight. 

Glory  .  .  . 

All  mortal  nature  marvelled  thereat,  that  thou,  the  Only-begotten  Son 
of  the  Father  who  is  from  everlasting',  from  a  Virgin,  through  the  opera- 
tion of  the  Holy  Spirit  didst  take  flesh,  and  as  man  didst  suffer,  and  didst 
give  life  unto  those  who  were  dead.  Wherefore,  we  fervently  entreat 
thee,  forasmuch  as  thou  art  good :  In  the  land  of  the  living  establish  thou 
those  who  have  suffered  for  thy  Holy  Church  and  the  Fatherland. 

Now,  and  ever,  . 

We  call  thee  the  Bride  of  the  Father  Invisible,  O  most  Pure  One,  and 
Mother  of  the  Son  who  by  the  Holy  Spirit  was  incarnate  of  thee :  And  we 
offer  unto  thee  our  supplications  on  behalf  of  those  who  have  suffered  for 
the  Church  of  thy  Son,  and  for  their  Fatherland.  For  in  thee  we,  who 
are  of  the  earth,  have  a  Mediatrix,  and  singing  with  love  thy  praises,  we 
magnify  thee. 


THE  OFFICE  FOR  RECEIVING  INTO  THE  ORTHO- 
DOX FAITH  SUCH  PERSONS  AS  HAVE  NOT  PRE- 
VIOUSLY BEEN  ORTHODOX, 

BUT  HAVE  BEEN  REARED  FROM  INFANCY  OUTSIDE  THE  ORTHODOX  CHURCH, 
YET  HAVE  RECEIVED  VALID  BAPTISM,  IN  THE  NAME  OF  THE  FATHER, 
AND  OF  THE  SON,  AND  OF  THE  HOLY  SPIRIT  * 

The  power  of  granting  absolution  to  such  persons,  and  of  uniting  them  to  the  Church, 
properly  devolveth  on  a  Bishop.  Nevertheless,  that  the  converts  to  Orthodoxy  may 
not  be  tempted  to  return  to  their  heresy  by  reason  of  delay,  it  is  wiser  and  more 
expedient  that  the  Bishop  should  delegate  his  power,  and  grant  his  blessing  there- 
with, to  a  Priest  well  versed  in  divine  lore,  and  who  is  competent  to  instruct  such  a 
person  in  the  articles  of  the  Orthodox  faith,  and  to  correct  his  erroneous  opinions. 

Therefore,  first  of  all,  the  penitent  shall  be  examined  with  due  caution  (either  by  the 
Bishop  or  by  the  person  to  whom  he  hath  delegated  his  authority)  as  to  the  particu- 
lars of  his  errors. 

Then  must  he  be  convinced  of  them. 

Thereafter,  he  shall  be  instructed  in  the  doctrine  of  the  Orthodox  faith,  and  confirmed 
therein. 

And  when  the  appointed  examination  and  instruction  have  been  completed,  with  all 
precaution  shall  the  Bishop  require  from  the  penitent  the  confession  of  all  his  sins, 
which  he  can  recall,  from  his  youth  up. 

And  the  Bishop  shall  not  immediately  thereafter  grant  him  absolution;  but  after  the 
confession  and  exhortation,  he  shall  go  with  him  into  the  Church,  and  shall  place 
him  before  the  church  doors,  in  the  church  porch. 

And  the  Bishop,  vested  in  his  priestly  stole  and  pall  (omofor) and  mitre,  and  having 
in  his  left  hand  his  pastoral  staff,  shall  take  his  seat  upon  his  throne  {but  if  a 
Priest  holding  power  to  this  end  from  the  Bishop  officiate,  he  shall  be  vested  in  his 
priestly  stole  and  chasuble,  and  shall  stand  at  the  door  of  the  Church). 

And  if  the  convert  cometh  to  the  Orthodox  Faith  from  the  Roman-Latin  Confession 
{or  from  a  Protestant  Confession),  the  Bishop  shall  question  him,  and  shall  say: 

Wilt  thou  renounce  the  errors  and  false  doctrines  of  the  Roman-Latin 
{or  Armenian,  or  Lutheran,  or  Reformed)  Confession? 

And  he  shall  reply:  I  will. 

Then  the  Bishop  demandeth  of  him,  from  whatever  confession  he  may  come: 
Dost  thou  desire  to  enter  into  and  abide  in  the  communion  of  the 
Orthodox-Catholic  Faith? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Then  the  Bishop,  rising,  signeth  him  with  his  right  hand,  in  the  form  of  a  cross 
saying: 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Amen.

THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS  455 

And  laying  his  hand  upon  the  bowed  head  of  the  convert,  he  shall  recite  the  following 
Prayer: 

The  Deacon  saith:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

The  Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

In  thy  Name,  O  Lord  God  of  truth,  and  in  the  Name  of  thine  Only-begot- 
ten Son,  and  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  look  upon  thy  servant,  N.,  whom  thou  hast 
graciously  enabled  to  have  recourse  unto  thy  Holy  Orthodox  Church,  and 
to  take  refuge  under  the  shadow  of  her  wings.  Remove  far  from  him  (her) 
his  (her)  former  errors,  and  fill  him  (her)  with  the  true  faith,  and  hope, 
and  love  which  are  in  thee.  Enable  him  (her)  to  walk  in  all  thy  com- 
mandments, and  to  fulfil  those  things  which  are  well-pleasing  unto  thee; 
for  if  a  man  do  these  things,  he  shall  also  find  life  in  them.  Inscribe  him 
(her)  in  thy  Book  of  Life,  and  unite  him  (her)  to  the  flock  of  thine  inherit- 
ance: and  may  thy  holy  Name  be  glorified  in  him  (her),  together  with  that 
of  thy  beloved  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  of  thy  Life-giving  Spirit. 
Let  thine  eyes  ever  look  upon  him  (her)  with  mercy,  and  let  thine  ears 
alway  receive  the  voice  of  his  (her)  supplication.  Make  him  (her)  to  re- 
joice in  the  work  of  his  (her)  hands,  and  in  all  his  (her)  generation,  that 
he  (she)  may  confess  thee,  worshipping  thee  and  glorifying  thy  great  and 
exalted  Name,  and  magnify  thee  alway,  all  the  days  of  his  (her)  life. 

Exclamation.  For  all  the  Powers  of  heaven  sing  praises  unto  thee,  and 
thine  is  the  glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

After  the  Prayer,  the  Bishop  (or  Priest)  shall  say  to  the  convert: 
Wherefore  renounce  now,  with  all  thy  heart,  thine  errors,  and  false  doc- 
trines, and  mistakes  of  j  udgment,  and  confess  the  Orthodox-Catholic  Faith . 
(or,  without  specific  renunciation:  Hast  thou  renounced:  page  457.) 

And  the  Bishop  questioneth  the  convert  from  the  Roman-Latin  Confession.        ~ 

Dost  thou  renounce  the  false  doctrine  that,  for  the  expression  of 
the  dogma  touching  the  Procession  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  declara- 
tion of  our  Saviour  Christ  himself:  "who  proceedeth  from  the 
Father":  doth  not  suffice;  and  that  the  addition,  of  man's  inven- 
tion: "and  from  the  Son":  is  required? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  that  it  doth  not  suffice 
to  confess  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  as  the  head  of  the  Universal 
Church;  and  that  a  man,  to  wit,  the  Bishop  of  Rome,  can  be  the  head 
of  Christ's  Body,  that  is  to  say,  of  the  whole  Church? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  that  the  holy 
Apostles  did  not  receive  from  our  Lord  equal  spiritual  power,  but 
that  the  holy  Apostle  Peter  was  their  Prince:  And  that  the  Bishop 
of  Rome  alone  is  his  successor:  And  that  the  Bishops  of  Jerusalem,

Alexandria,  Antioch  and  others  are  not,  equally  with  the  Bishop 
of  Rome,  successors  of  the  Apostles? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  of  those  who 
think  that  the  Pope  of  Rome  is  superior  to  the  CEcumenical  Councils, 
and  infallible  in  faith,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  several  of  the 
Popes  have  been  heretics,  and  condemned  as  such  by  the  Councils? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  all  the  other  doctrines  of  the  West- 
ern Confession,  both  old  and  new,  which  are  contrary  to  the  Word 
of  God,  and  to  the  true  tradition  of  the  Church,  and  to  the  decrees  of 
the  seven  CEcumenical  Councils? 

Answer.  I  do.  _ 

The  convert  from  the  Armenian   Confession  is  questioned  as  follows   by  the 
Bishop: 

Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  that  in  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ  there  are  not  two  natures,  Divine  and  human,  but  one  only; 
the  human  nature  being  swallowed  up  by  the  Divine? 

Answer.  I  do. 

The  Bishop  questioneth  the  convert  from  the  Lutheran  Confession  thus: 

Dost  thou  renounce  the  false  doctrine  that,  for  the  expression  of  the 
dogma  touching  the  Procession  of  the  Holy  Ghost  the  declaration 
of  our  Saviour  Christ  himself:  "who  proceedeth  from  the  Father": 
doth  not  suffice;  and  that  the  addition,  of  man's  invention:  "and 
from  the  Son":  is  required? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  that  in  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Holy  Eucharist  the  bread  is  not  transmuted  into 
the  Body  of  Christ,  and  doth  not  become  the  Body  of  Christ;  and 
that  the  wine  is  not  transmuted  into  the  Blood  of  Christ,  and  doth 
not  become  the  Blood  of  Christ;  but  that  the  presence  of  Christ's 
Body  only  for  a  short  time  doth  touch  the  bread,  which  remaineth 
simple  bread? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  of  the  teachers 
who  do  not  accept  as  Sacraments  Chrismation,  Marriage,  Anoint- 
ing with  Oil,  and  the  Priesthood  itself,  which  administereth  the 
other  Sacraments,  and  presume  to  administer  Baptism  and  the  Euchar- 
ist, never  having  received,  through  the  laying-on  of  hands  by  a 
Bishop,  that  Ordination  which  hath  been  transmitted  from  one  to 
another,  even  from  the  holy  Apostles? 

Answer.  I  do.

who  receive  not  the  traditions  of  the  Holy  Church,  reverence  not 
the  Saints,  and  deprive  the  dead  of  spiritual  aid  and  the  living  of 
spiritual  consolation,  in  that  they  reject  prayers  for  the  dead? 
Answer.  I  do. 

The  Bishop  questioneth  the  convert  from  the  Reformed  Confession  after  this  wise: 

Dost  thou  renounce  the  false  doctrine  that,  for  the  expression  of 
the  dogma  touching  the  Procession  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  declara- 
tion of  our  Saviour  Christ  himself:  "who  proceedeth  from  the 
Father":  doth  not  suffice;  and  that  the  addition,  of  man's  invention: 
"and  from  the  Son":  is  required? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  false  doctrine,  that  the  predesti- 
nation of  men  to  their  salvation,  or  their  rejection,  is  not  in  accord- 
ance with  the  Divine  foreknowledge  of  the  faith  and  good  works  of 
the  former,  or  of  the  unbelief  and  evil  deeds  of  the  latter;  but  in 
accordance  with  some  arbitrary  destiny,  by  reason  of  which  faith 
and  virtue  are  robbed  of  their  merit,  and  God  is  held  accountable 
for  the  perdition  of  sinners? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  that  in  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Holy  Eucharist  the  bread  and  wine  are  not  trans- 
muted into  the  Body  and  Blood  of  Christ,  and  are  merely  emblems  of 
the  Body  and  Blood  of  Christ? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  of  the  Reformed 
teachers,  who  reject  five  Sacraments:  Chrismation,  Confession,  Mar- 
riage, Anointing  with  Oil,  and  the  Priesthood  itself,  which  admin- 
istereth  the  other  Sacraments,  and  presume  to  administer  Baptism 
and  the  Eucharist,  never  having  received,  through  the  laying-on  of 
hands  by  a  Bishop,  that  Ordination  which  hath  been  transmitted  from 
one  to  another,  even  from  the  holy  Apostles? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  renounce  the  erroneous  belief  of  the  Reformed 
teachers  who  receive  not  the  traditions  of  the  Holy  Church,  rever- 
ence not  the  Saints,  and  deprive  the  dead  of  spiritual  aid,  and  the 
living  of  consolation,  in  that  they  reject  prayers  for  the  dead? 

Answer.  I  do. 

And  after  these  special  questions,  appointed  for  the  converts  from  different  Confes- 
sions, the  Bishop  shall  proceed  with  the  catechizing  which  is  common  to  all,  and 
shall  ask: 

Bishop.  Hast  thou  renounced  all  ancient  and  modern  heresies  and 
false  doctrines  which  are  contrary  to  the  teachings  of  the  Holy 
Orthodox-Catholic  Eastern  Church? 

Answer.  I  have. 


458  THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  desire  to  be  united  unto  the  Holy  Orthodox- 
Catholic  Eastern  Church? 

Answer.  I  desire  it  with  all  my  heart. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  in  one  God,  who  is  adored  in  the  holy 
Trinity,  the  Father,  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit:  and  dost  thou  worship 
him  as  thy  King  and  thy  God? 

Answer.  I  believe  in  one  God  who  is  glorified  and  adored  in  the  Trinity, 
the  Father,  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit;  and  I  worship  him  as  my  King 
and  my  God. 

Then  he  maketh  one  lowly  reverence,  kneeling  and  bowing  his  head  to  the  earth,  and 
reciteth  the  Creed. 

I  believe  in  one  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth, 
And  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible: 

And  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  only-begotten  Son  of  God,  Begotten 
of  his  Father  before  all  worlds;  Light  of  Light,  Very  God  of  very  God, 
Begotten,  not  made;  Being  of  one  Essence  with  the  Father;  By  whom 
all  things  were  made;  Who,  for  us  men,  and  for  our  salvation,  came 
down  from  heaven,  And  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Ghost  of  the  Virgin 
Mary,  And  was  made  man.  And  was  crucified  also  for  us  under  Pontius 
Pilate,  and  suffered  and  was  buried.  And  the  third  day  he  rose  again, 
according  to  the  Scriptures.  And  ascended  into  heaven,  And  sitteth  on 
the  right  hand  of  the  Father.  And  he  shall  come  again  with  glory  to 
judge  both  the  quick  and  the  dead;  Whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end. 

And  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Lord  and  Giver  of  Life,  Who  proceedeth 
from  the  Father,  Who  with  the  Father  and  the  Son  together  is  worshipped 
and  glorified,  Who  spake  by  the  Prophets.  In  one  Holy  Catholic  and 
Apostolic  Church.  I  acknowledge  one  Baptism  for  the  remission  of 
sins.  And  I  look  for  the  Resurrection  of  the  dead,  And  the  Life  of  the 
world  to  come.     Amen. 

Bishop.  Blessed  is  God,  who  enlighteneth  every  man  that  cometh. 
into  the  world. 

Or  the  Bishop  {or  Priest)  may,  at  his 
discretion,  use  the  Shorter  Office,  as  fol- 
loweth: 


And  again  the  Bishop  saith: 
Dost  thou  accept  the  Apostolical 
and  Ecclesiastical  Canons  framed 
and  established  at  the  Seven  Holy 
Universal  and  Provincial  Councils, 
and  the  other  traditions  and  ordi- 
nances of  the  Orthodox  Church? 
Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  acknowledge 
that  the  Holy  Scriptures  must  be

dox Church,  our  Mother,  hath  al- 
ways held  and  still  doth  hold? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  and 
confess  that  there  are  seven  Sacra- 
ments of  the  New  Testament,  to 
wit:  Baptism,  Chrismation,  the 
Eucharist,  Confession,  the  Priest- 
hood, Marriage,  and  Anointing 
with  Oil,  instituted  by  the  Lord 
Christ  and  his  Church,  to  the  end 
that,  through  their  operation  and 
reception,  we  may  obtain  blessings 
from  on  high? 

Answer.  I  believe  and  confess  it. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  and 
confess  that  in  the  Divine  Liturgy, 
under  the  mystical  forms  of  the 
holy  bread  and  wine,  the  faithful 
partake  of  the  Body  and  Blood  of 
our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  unto  the 
remission  of  sins,  and  unto  life 
eternal  ? 

Answer.  I  believe  and  confess  it. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  and 
confess  that  it  is  proper  to  rever- 
ence and  invoke  the  Saints  who 
reign  on  high  with  Christ,  accord- 
ing to  the  interpretation  of  the 
Holy  Orthodox  Church;  and  that 
their  prayers  and  intercessions  be- 
fore God  avail  with  the  beneficent 
God  unto  our  salvation:  and  that 
it  is  well-pleasing  in  the  sight  of 
God  that  we  should  do  homage 
to  their  relics,  glorified  through  in- 
corruption,  as  precious  memorials 
of  their  virtue? 

Answer.  I  believe  and  confess  it. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  confess  that 
the  images  of  our  Saviour  Christ; 
and  of  the  Ever-virgin  Mother  of 
God,  and  of  the  other  Saints  are 
worthy    of    being    possessed    and 


Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Apostolic 
Church  of  the  East,  its  rules  and 
ordinances;  and  I  likewise  will 
accept  and  understand  Holy  Scrip- 
ture in  accordance  with  the  inter- 
pretation which  the  Holy  Orthodox- 
Catholic  Church  of  the  East,  our 
Mother,  hath  held,  and  doth  hold. 

I  believe  and  confess  that  there 
are  Seven  Sacraments  of  the  New 
Testament,  to  wit:  Baptism,  Chris- 
mation, the  Eucharist,  Confession, 
the  Priesthood,  Marriage,  and 
Anointing  with  Oil,  instituted  by 
the  Lord  Christ  and  his  Church,  to 
the  end  that,  through  their  opera- 
tion and  reception,  we  may  receive 
blessings  from  on  high. 

I  believe  and  confess  that,  in 
the  Divine  Liturgy,  under  the 
mystical  forms  of  bread  and  wine, 
the  faithful  partake  of  the  true 
Body  and  Blood  of  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  unto  the  remission  of  their 
sins,  and  unto  life  eternal. 

I  believe  and  confess  that  it  is 
proper  to  reverence  and  invoke 
the  Saints  who  reign  on  high  with 
Christ,  according  to  the  interpreta- 
tion of  the  Holy  Orthodox-Catholic 
Church  of  the  East;  and  that  their 
prayers  and  intercessions  avail  with 
the  beneficent  God  unto  our  salva- 
tion: Likewise  that  it  is  well- 
pleasing  in  the  sight  of  God  that 
we  should  do  homage  to  their 
relics,  glorified  through  incorrup- 
tion,  as  the  precious  memorials 
of  their  virtues. 

I  acknowledge  that  the  images 
of  our  Saviour  Christ,  and  of  the 
Ever- virgin  Mother  of  God,  and 
of  other  Saints  are  worthy  to  be 
possessed  and  honoured;  not  unto

that,  through  contemplation  there- 
of, we  may  be  incited  unto  piety, 
and  unto  emulation  of  the  deeds  of 
the  holy  persons  represented  by 
these  images? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  confess  that 
the  prayers  of  the  faithful  which 
are  offered  up  to  God,  and  more 
especially  when  accompanied  by 
the  oblation  of  the  unbloody  sac- 
rifice, for  the  salvation  of  those 
who  have  departed  this  life  in 
the  faith,  are  favourably  received, 
through  the  mercy  of  God? 

Answer.  I  do. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  and 
confess  that  power  hath  been  given 
by  our  Saviour  Christ  unto  the 
Orthodox-Catholic  Church  to  bind 
and  to  loose :  and  that  whatsoever, 
by  virtue  of  that  power,  is  bound 
or  loosed  on  earth  will  be  bound 
or  loosed  in  heaven? 

Answer.  I  believe  and  confess  it. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  believe  and 
confess  that  the  Foundation,  Head, 
and  Great  High  Priest  and  Chief 
Shepherd  of  the  Holy  Orthodox-

Christ;  and  that  Bishops,  Pastors 
and  Teachers  are  appointed  by  him 
to  rule  the  Church;  and  that  the 
Guide  and  Pilot  of  this  Church  is 
the  Holy  Spirit? 

Answer.  I  believe  and  confess 
that  this  Church  is  the  Bride  of 
Christ,  and  that  therein  is  true 
salvation,  which  was  in  the  Ark  of  Noah  at  the  Flood. 

Bishop.  Dost  thou  promise  true  obedience,  unto  thy  life's  end,  in 
guidance  which  is  salutary  unto  the  soul,  to  the  Most  Holy  Synod;  to 
the  Most  Holy  Patriarch,  the  Equal-of- the- Apostles  (or  to  the  Ecclesias- 
tical Authorities  of  the  Autocephalous  Provincial  Church) ;  and  to  the 


templation  thereof,  we  may  be 
incited  unto  piety,  and  unto  emula- 
tion of  the  deeds  of  the  holy  persons 
represented  by  those  images. 

I  confess  that  the  prayers  of  the 
faithful,  which  are  offered  up  to 
God  for  the  salvation  of  those  who 
have  departed  this  life  in  the  faith, 
are  favourably  received,  through 
the  mercy  of  God. 

I  believe  and  confess  that  power 
hath  been  given  by  our  Saviour 
Christ  unto  the  Holy  Orthodox- 
Catholic  Church,  to  bind  and  to 
loose:  and  that  whatsoever,  by 
virtue  of  that  power,  is  bound  or 
loosed  on  earth  will  be  bound  or 
loosed  in  heaven. 

I  believe  and  confess  that  the 
Foundation,  Head,  and  Great  High 
Priest  and  Chief  Shepherd  of  the 
Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Church 
is  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ:  and  that 
Bishops,  Pastors  and  Teachers  are

Pilot  of  this  Church  is  the  Holy 
Spirit. 

I  confess  that  this  Church  is  the 
Bride  of  Christ,  and  that  therein 
is  true  salvation. 

I  promise  true  obedience,  unto 
my  life's  end,  to  the  Most  Holy 
Synod  (if  it  be  in  a  Diocese,  then  the 
Bishop  of  that  Diocese  is  named), 
as  the  true  Pastor  of  the  Orthodox 
Church,  and  to  the  Priests  ap- 
pointed by  them. 


THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS  461 

Bishop  of  this  Diocese,  as  the  true  Pastors  appointed  by  the  Holy  Spirit; 
and  to  the  Priests  ordained  by  them? 
Answer.  I  promise  it,  with  heart  unfeigned. 

Then  the  Bishop  giveth  him  the  end  of  his  pall  (omofor)  (if  a  Priest  officiate,  he 
giveth  him  the  end  of  his  priestly  stole  (epitrakhil))  in  his  right  hand,  saying: 

Enter  thou  into  the  Orthodox  Church;  and  cast  away  all  the  errors 
and  false  doctrines  wherein  thou  hast  dwelt:  and  honour  the  Lord  God, 
the  Father  Almighty,  and  his  Only-begotten  Son  Jesus  Christ,  and  the 
Holy  Spirit,  one  true  and  living  God,  the  holy  Trinity,  one  in  Essence 
and  indivisible. 

And  having  thus  spoken,  he  leadeth  the  convert  into  the  Church,  holding  the  end  of  the 
pall  (or  of  the  priestly  stole),  and  placeth  him  in  front  of  the  tribune,  where,  upon 
a  table,  is  laid  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels:  and  when  he  hath  taken  his  place,  the 
convert  immediately  looseth  the  end  of  the  pall  from  his  hand.  And  as  they  enter 
the  Church,  the  Reader  shall  read: 

Psalm  lxvii. 
God  be  merciful  unto  us,  and  bless  us,  and  show  us  the  light  of  his 
countenance,  and  be  merciful  unto  us;  that  thy  way  may  be  known  upon 
earth,  thy  saving  health  among  all  nations.  Let  the  people  praise  thee, 
0  God;  yea,  let  all  the  people  praise  thee.  O  let  the  nations  rejoice  and 
be  glad;  for  thou  shalt  judge  the  folk  righteously,  and  govern  the  nations 
upon  earth.  Let  the  people  praise  thee,  O  God;  yea,  let  all  the  people 
praise  thee.  Then  shall  the  earth  bring  forth  her  increase;  and  God, 
even  our  own  God,  shall  give  us  his  blessing.  God  shall  bless  us;  and 
all  the  ends  of  the  world  shall  fear  him. 

And  when  the  Psalm  is  finished,  the  Bishop  commandeth  the  convert  to  kneel  down 
before  the  Holy  Gospels. 

And  when  he  hath  done  this,  the  Bishop  reciteih  the  following  Verses: 

Send  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  they  shall  be  created;  and  renew  the  face 
of  the  earth. 

Turn  again,  O  Lord,  how  long?    And  be  entreated  for  thy  servant. 

The  crooked  places  shall  be  made  straight,  and  the  rough  ways  plain. 

O  Lord  my  God,  save  thy  servant,  who  putteth  his  trust  in  thee. 

Be  thou  unto  him,  O  Lord,  a  pillar  of  strength  against  the  face  of  the 
enemy - 

Let  the  enemy  in  nowise  prevail  against  him,  and  let  not  the  son  of 
iniquity  go  about  to  offend  him. 

Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  let  the  voice  of  my  cry  come  unto  thee. 

Then  immediately  the  Deacon  shall  say: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. — ■ — Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  the  Bishop,  with  all  devoutness,  shall  recite  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Lord  God  Almighty,  who  alone  art  holy,  and  restest  in  the  Saints; 
who,  because  of  thy  great  and  incalculable  love  toward  mankind,  dost 


462  THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS 

alway  offer  unto  them  that  have  sinned  divers  manners  of  repentance, 
and  dost  show  unto  them  that  have  wandered  from  the  truth  the  right 
path  unto  knowledge  of  thee,  the  only  true  God,  who  art  glorified 
and  adored  in  the  Trinity,  that  not  one  of  them  should  perish,  but  that 
all  may  be  saved,  and  come  unto  the  knowledge  of  the  truth:  We  thank 
thee,  we  glorify  thee,  and  we  magnify  thee,  for  that  thou  hast  now  shed 
down  into  the  heart  of  this,  thy  reason-endowed  creature,  N.,  the  light 
which  is  unto  the  knowledge  of  thy  truth;  and  hast  graciously  enabled 
him  {her)  to  have  recourse  unto  thy  Holy  Apostolic  Orthodox-Catholic 
Church.  Illumine  his  {her)  heart,  O  Lord,  we  humbly  beseech  thee, 
with  the  perfect  light  of  the  grace  of  thy  Holy  Spirit  unto  the  enlighten- 
ing of  his  {her)  mind  in  the  truth  of  thy  Holy  Gospel.  Grant  that  he 
{she)  may  unfeignedly,  irrevocably  and  without  hypocrisy  unite  himself 
{herself)  unto  thy  Holy  Catholic  Church,  and  truly  accept  and  confess 
the  Orthodox-Catholic  faith.  Number  him  {her)  with  thy  chosen  flock, 
and  unite  him  {her)  to  the  body  of  thy  Holy  Church.  Make  him  {her) 
a  vessel  of  honour,  and  the  temple  of  thy  Holy  Spirit;  that,  being  ever 
nourished  and  guided  by  the  Same,  he  {she)  may  keep  thy  saving  com- 
mandments; and  that  doing  thy  gracious,  acceptable  and  perfect  will, 
he  {she)  may  be  counted  worthy  to  receive  thy  heavenly  good  things, 
together  with  all  those  who  are  well-pleasing  in  thy  sight.  For  thou  art 
the  God  of  mercy  and  compassion  and  love  toward  mankind,  and  wiliest 
that  all  men  should  be  saved;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 

ages  of  ages. Choir.  Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  the  Bishop  commandeth  him  to  stand,  saying: 

Rise,  and  stand  aright:  stand  with  fear. 

And  he,  rising,  saith: 

This  true  faith  of  the  Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Church,  which  I  now 
voluntarily  confess  and  unfeignedly  hold,  I  will  firmly  maintain  and 
confess  whole  and  in  its  fulness  and  integrity,  until  my  last  breath, 
God  being  my  helper;  and  will  teach  it  and  proclaim  it,  so  far  as  in  me 
lieth;  and  will  strive  to  fulfil  its  obligations  cheerfully  and  with  joy, 
preserving  my  heart  in  purity  and  virtue.  And  in  confirmation  of  this, 
my  true  and  sincere  profession  of  faith,  I  now  kiss  the  word  and  cross  of 
my  Saviour.     Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  giveth  him  the  Holy  Gospels  and  the  cross  to  kiss.    And  after  he  hath 
kissed  them,  he  saith: 

Blessed  is  God,  who  willeth  that  all  men  should  be  saved,  and  should 
come  unto  the  knowledge  of  the  truth:  Blessed  is  he  forevermore. 
Choir.  Amen. 

Then  he  saith  to  the  convert: 

Bow  thy  knees  before  the  Lord  God,  whom  thou  hast  confessed,  and 
receive  remission  of  thy  sins. 


THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS  463 

And  the  convert  kneeleth  down  and  boweth  his  head,  having  his  eyes  cast  down.  Then 
the  Bishop  (or  he  who  hath  received  this  power  from  him),  pronounceth  the  absolu- 
tion thus: 

(The  form  of  absolving  such  a  convert  from  Excommunication,  and  from  his  sins,  and 
of  joining  him  unto  the  Holy  Catholic  Church.) 

Our  Lord  and  God  Jesus  Christ  committed  unto  his  Apostles  the 
keys  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  bestowed  upon  them  full  power 
through  his  grace,  both  to  bind  and  to  loose  a  man  from  his  sins  upon 
earth:  May  the  same,  through  his  unspeakable  mercy,  pardon  and  ab- 
solve thee.  And  I,  by  his  almighty  power,  given  unto  me,  an  unworthy 
Bishop  (or  Priest),  through  his  holy  Apostles  and  their  successors,  do 
pardon  and  absolve  thee,  my  child  (N.),  from  all  thy  sins:  and  do  unite 
thee  unto  the  fellowship  of  the  faithful,  and  unto  the  body  of  Christ's 
Church:  and  do  communicate  thee  with  the  Divine  Sacraments  of  the 
Church:  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit.     Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  saith  to  him: 

Rise,  brother  (sister),  and  as  a  faithful  servant  of  Jesus  Christ  pray 
thou  unto  him  with  us,  that  he  will  vouchsafe  unto  thee,  through  anoint- 
ment with  the  holy  Chrism,  to  receive  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

And  rising,  the  convert  standeth  with  all  emotion. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  ANOINTMENT  WITH  THE  HOLY  CHRISM 
INTO  THE  ORTHODOX  FAITH  OF  THOSE  WHO  HAVE  BEEN 
CONVERTED  AND  HAVE  UNITED  THEMSELVES  WITH  THE

When  the  foregoing  Office  hath  been  completed,  one  of  the  Priests,  or  a  Proto-Deacon

and  a  sponge,  and  a  wand  and,  in  a  small  vessel,  warm  water  for  wetting  the  sponge, 
that  the  places  anointed  with  the  holy  Chrism  may  be  wiped  off,  setteth  them  on  the 
table  which  hath  been  prepared,  upon  which,  also,  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels 
shall  be  laid,  and  the  Life-giving  Cross;  and  on  which,  also,  shall  be  placed  two 
lighted  tapers,  in  candlesticks. 

And  when  these  things  have  been  made  ready,  the  Bishop  (or  the  Priest)  maketh  three 
reverences  toward  the  east,  as  do  all  those  who  are  present. 

The  Deacon  saith: 
Bless,  Master. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of 
the  Holy  Spirit. Choir.     Amen. 

Then  shall  be  sung,  in  Tone  VI. 
O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save 
our  souls,  O  Good  One.

of  Righteousness,  who  sheddest  forth  upon  them  that  were  in  darkness 
the  light  of  salvation,  through  the  manifestation  of  thine  Only-begotten

soul  in  purity  and  uprightness,  through  the  saving  fear  of  thee;  that  he 
{she)  may  please  thee  in  every  deed  and  word,  and  may  be  a  child  and 
heir  of  thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

For  thou  art  our  God,  the  God  whose  property  it  is  to  show  mercy 
and  to  save ;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the 
Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.  — ■ — ■  Choir    Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  after  this  Prayer,  the  Priest  straightway  anointeth  the  Convert  with  the  holy 
Chrism,  making  the  sign  of  the  cross  upon  his  brow  and  eyes,  and  nostrils  and  lips, 
and  on  both  ears,  and  breast,  and  hands  and  feet,  saying: 

The  seal  of  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

And  when  this  hath  been  done,  he  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  graciously  vouchsafed  to  show  this  thy 
servant,  N.,  perfect,  through  the  true  faith  which  is  in  thee,  and  through 
the  seal  of  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  in  thy  holy  and  most  heavenly 
anointing:  Do  thou,  O  Lord  of  all,  maintain  in  him  {her)  the  true  faith; 
train  him  {her)  in  righteousness  and  verity;  and  adorn  him  {her)  with 
all  thy  gifts. 


466  THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS 

For  thou  art  our  God,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  sponge,  and  dipping  it  in  the  warm  water,  he  wipeth  the  places 
which  have  been  anointed  with  the  holy  Chrism,  saying: 

Thou  art  justified.  Thou  art  illumined.  Thou  art  sanctified;  in  the 
Name  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  by  the  Spirit  of  our  God.  Thou 
hast  received  anointment  with  the  holy  Chrism,  in  the  Name  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  all  bow  their  heads,  and  the  Priest  recitetk,  secretly,  the  following  Prayer: 
He  (she)  who  hath  put  on  thee,  O  Christ  and  our  God,  now  boweth  his 
(her)  head  with  us  unto  thee.     Keep  him  (her)  always  a  warrior  invincible 
in  every  attack  of  those  who  assail  him  (her)  and  us:  and  make  us  all 
victors  even  unto  the  end,  through  thy  crown  incorruptible. 

Exclamation. 

For  thy  property  it  is  to  show  mercy  and  to  save  ;  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine 
all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Litany.

And  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  Benediction. 
He  who  hath  received  Anointment  with  the  holy  Chrism  is  blessed  unto  the  reception 
of  the  Most  Holy  Sacrament  of  the  Body  and  Blood  of  the  Lord  at  the  Divine  Lit- 
urgy.    For  these  things  are  done  before  the  Liturgy. 

(There  are  several  differences  in  this  Office,  as  celebrated  in  the  Greek  Church ; 
but  they  are  not  important.) 


THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  INTO  THE  ORTHODOX 
CHURCH  OF  JEWS,  MAHOMETANS  (SARACENS)  AND  HEA- 
THENS 

Differeth  from  that  for  persons  who  have  already  received  holy  Baptism. 
After  the  Choir  hath  sung  Psalm  xxxiv.  : 
I  will  alway  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord;  his  praise  shall  ever  be  in 
my  mouth  My  soul  shall  make  her  boast  in  the  Lord ;  the  humble  shall 
hear  thereof,  and  be  glad.  O  praise  the  Lord  with  me,  and  let  us  mag- 
nify his  Name  together.  I  sought  the  Lord,  and  he  heard  me;  yea,  he 
delivered  me  out  of  all  my  fear.  They  had  an  eye  unto  him,  and  were 
lightened;  and  their  faces  were  not  ashamed.  Lo,  the  poor  crieth,  and 
the  Lord  heareth  him;  yea,  and  saveth  him  out  of  all  his  troubles.  The 
angel  of  the  Lord  tarrieth  round  about  them  that  fear  him,  and  deliv- 
ered! them.  O  taste,  and  see,  how  gracious  the  Lord  is:  blessed  is  the 
man  that  trusteth  in  him.  O  fear  the  Lord,  ye  that  are  his  saints;  for 
they  that  fear  him  lack  nothing.  The  lions  do  lack,  and  suffer  hunger; 
but  they  who  seek  the  Lord  shall  want  no  manner  of  thing  that  is  good. 
Come,  ye  children,  and  hearken  unto  me;  I  will  teach  you  the  fear  of  the 
Lord.  What  man  is  he  that  lusteth  to  live,  and  would  fain  see  good  days? 
Keep  thy  tongue  from  evil,  and  thy  lips,  that  they  speak  no  guile.  Es- 
chew evil,  and  do  good;  seek  peace,  and  ensue  it.  The  eyes  of  the  Lord 
are  over  the  righteous,  and  his  ears  are  open  unto  their  prayers.  The 
countenance  of  the  Lord  is  against  them  that  do  evil,  to  root  out  the  re- 
membrance of  them  from  the  earth.  The  righteous  cry,  and  the  Lord 
heareth  them,  and  delivereth  them  out  of  all  their  troubles.  The  Lord 
is  nigh  unto  them  that  are  of  a  contrite  heart,  and  will  save  such  as  be  of 
an  humble  spirit.  Great  are  the  troubles  of  the  righteous;  but  the  Lord 
delivereth  him  out  of  all.  He  keepeth  all  his  bones,  so  that  not  one  of 
them  is  broken.     But  misfortune  shall  slay  the  ungodly;  and  they  that 


к* 


468  THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS 

hate  the  righteous  shall  be  desolate.     The  Lord  delivereth  the  souls  of 
his  servants;  and  all  they  that  put  their  trust  in  him  shall  not  be  destitute. 

The  Bishop,  or  Priest,  inquireth,  at  the  door  of  the  Church: 

Who  art  thou? 

Answer.  I   am  one  who  desireth  to  know  the  true  God,  and  seeketh 
salvation. 

Priest.  Why  art  thou  come  to  the  Holy  Church? 

Answer.  That  I  may  learn  from  her  the  true  faith,  and  unite  myself 
unto  her. 

Priest.  What  profit  dost  thou  hope  to  receive  from  the  true  faith? 

Answer.  Life  eternal  and  blessed. 

The  Catechumen  is  then  asked  to  renounce  his  errors  and  confess  his  belief. 

The  Jew  renounceth:  The  blasphemies  of  the  Jews  against  Jesus 
Christ  our  Saviour,  his  most  holy  Mother  and  his  Saints;  circum- 
cision; the  observance  of  Saturday,  and  all  Jewish  festivals  and 
ceremonies;  the  Rabbinical  interpretation  of  the  Scriptures  con- 
tained in  the  Talmud  and  ancient  and  modern  writings;  the  doc- 
trine that  the  Messiah  is  not  yet  come;  and  the  vain  expectation  of 
his  coming.  _ 

{The  Jew  accepteth  the  belief:  That  the  Father,  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit  are  one 
God,  divided  in  three  Persons,  but  in  Essence  undivided;  that  Jesus  Christ,  the 
Only-begotten  Son  of  God,  was  incarnate  by  the  Holy  Spirit  of  the  Virgin  Mary  for 
the  sake  of  our  salvation,  and  became  very  man,  yet  remaining  very  God,  one  in 
Essence,  but  in  two  Persons,  divine  and  human;  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  of  his 
own  free  will,  in  very  truth,  and  not  in  appearance  only,  suffered  for  us  in  the  flesh, 
but  not  in  his  divinity,  and,  having  died  and  been  buried  as  man,  rose  again  by 
virtue  of  his  divinity,  and  ascended  into  heaven  in  the  flesh;  that  the  Virgin  Mary 
was  and  remained  truly  Virgin,  and  truly  is  worthy  of  reverence  as  the  chief  inter- 
cessor for  us  with  God;  and  that  the  Cross  of  Christ  was  the  instrument  and  emblem 
of  our  salvation.) 

The  Mahometan  renounceth:  The  Mahometan  faith,  and  its  Soph- 
istries; Mahomet,  as  being  a  false  prophet;  the  Koran  and  all  false 
legends,  laws  and  traditions  therein  contained;  the  pilgrimage  to 
Mecca  for  worship,  as  salutary  to  the  soul ;  the  inculcation  of  polyg- 
amy in  this  life,  and  the  teaching  as  to  sensual  pleasures  in  Paradise; 
and  the  blasphemies  which  Mahometans  utter  touching  Christ  our 
Saviour,  his  most  holy  Mother,  and  Christians. 

{He  accepteth  all  the  points  set  forth  for  the  Jew,  and  in  addition  the  belief  that  the 
Holy  Scriptures  contained  in  the  Old  and  New  Testaments,  as  accepted  by  the 
Church,  are  the  Word  of  God,  given  for  our  salvation,  and  were  written  by  the  holy 
men  of  God  who  were  illumined  by  the  Holy  Spirit;  that  the  traditions,  regulations 
and  prayers  which  have  come  down  from  the  Apostles  and  the  holy  Fathers  of  the 
Church  are  salutary  for  the  soul;  and  that  the  Apostles,  Martyrs,  and  all  the  Saints 
revered  by  the  Holy  Church  are,  in  very  truth,  Saints  of  God,  abide  with  Christ  in 
the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  pray  for  us  sinners.  He  also  professeth  belief  touching 
the  holy  images  {see  page  459)  required  from  all  converts.)

THE  OFFICE  FOR  THE  RECEPTION  OF  CONVERTS  469 

The  Heathen  renounceth:  Heathen  superstitions;  the  adoration 
of  created  things;  the  worship  of  material  statues,  and  bowing 
down  to  idols;  the  offering  and  eating  of  sacrifices  unto  idols;  idola- 
trous priests  and  magicians,  and  their  superstitious  deeds  and  sooth- 
saying. 

(He  accepteth  the  same  as  the  Mahometan.) 
The  Convert  then  maketh  oath  of  allegiance. 

I,  N.,  who  to-day  am  come  to  enter  the  Christian  faith  from  Judaism 
(Mahometanism,  Heathenism)  to  the  Christian  faith,  take  my  oath  before 
omniscient  God,  that  I  renounce  the  false  doctrine  of  the  Jews  (Mahome- 
tans, Heathens),  and  all  the  heresies  and  calumnies  therein  contained,  and 
enter  the  saving  faith  of  Christ,  not  because  of  any  compulsion  or  fear, 
nor  because  of  the  oppression  of  my  fellow-believers,  and  not  for  the  sake 
of  gain,  neither  by  reason  of  any  hidden  guilt  on  my  part,  but  solely  for 
the  salvation  of  my  soul.  Being  convinced  of  the  very  truth  of  this  faith, 
and  drawn  by  the  love  of  my  heart  unto  Christ  the  Saviour,  I  desire  to 
become  a  Christian,  and  that  holy  Baptism  may  be  vouchsafed  unto  me. 
And  if  I  now  assert  these  things  through  hypocrisy,  and  come  not  unto 
Christ  my  God  through  the  desire  of  my  heart ;  and  if  I  shall  hereafter 
dare  to  renounce  the  Christian  faith,  and  return  unto  Judaism  (Mahom- 
etanism, Heathenism),  may  the  wrath  of  God  and  everlasting  damnation 
befall  me. 

And  after  this,  he  receiveth  Baptism,  Chrismation  and  the  Holy  Communion. 


THE  LESSER  BLESSING  OF  WATER 

A  small  table,  covered  with  a  cloth,  is  placed  in  the  centre  of  the  church,  at  the  cus- 
tomary spot,  and  water  thereon  in  a  vessel.  And  the  Priest,  putting  on  his  priestly 
stole  and  his  chasuble,  and  holding  in  his  hand  the  precious  cross  and  a  sprinkler 
for  the  holy  water,  is  preceded  by  the  Deacon  with  the  censer,  and  by  two  taper- 
hearers  with  tapers.  And  when  he  cometh  to  the  table,  he  layeth  the  cross  thereon, 
and  taking  the  censer,  he  censeth  the  water  in  cross-form,  and  maketh  the  usual 
beginning.  (See  page  479:  Blessed  is  our  God  .  .  .  to  end  of  the  Lord's  Prayer.) 
And  after  the  Priest  hath  pronounced  the  blessing,  the  Deacon  beginneth: 

Psalm  cxliii. 

Reader-  Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  consider  my  desire ;  hearken  unto 
me  for  thy  truth  and  righteousness'  sake.  And  enter  not  into  judgment 
with  thy  servant;  for  in  thy  sight  shall  no  man  living  be  justified.  For 
the  enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul;  he  hath  smitten  my  life  down  to 
the  ground ;  he  hath  laid  me  in  the  darkness,  as  the  men  that  have  been 
long  dead.  Therefore  is  my  spirit  vexed  within  me,  and  my  heart  within 
me  is  desolate.  Yet  do  I  remember  the  time  past:  I  muse  upon  all  thy 
works;  yea,  I  exercise  myself  in  the  works  of  thy  hands.  I  stretch  forth 
my  hands  unto  thee;  my  soul  gaspeth  unto  thee  as  a  thirsty  land.  Hear 
me,  O  Lord,  and  that  soon;  for  my  spirit  waxeth  faint:  hide  not  thy  face 
from  me,  lest  I  be  like  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit.  O  let  me  hear  thy 
loving-kindness  betimes  in  the  morning;  for  in  thee  is  my  trust:  show 
thou  me  the  way  that  I  should  walk  in ;  for  I  lift  up  my  soul  unto  thee. 
Deliver  me,  O  Lord,  from  mine  enemies;  for  I  flee  unto  thee  to  hide  me. 
Teach  me  to  do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee;  for  thou  art  my  God:  let 
thy  loving  Spirit  lead  me  forth  into  the  land  of  righteousness.  Quicken 
me,  O  Lord,  for  thy  Name's  sake,  and  for  thy  righteousness'  sake  bring 
my  soul  out  of  trouble.  And  of  thy  goodness  slay  mine  enemies,  and 
destroy  all  them  that  vex  my  soul ;  for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Deacon.  God  is  the  Lord,  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us.  Blessed 
is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord.     (Thrice.)     In  Tone  IV. 

And  these  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  IV 

Unto  the  Birth-giver  of  God  let  us  sinners  and  humble  ones  now 
diligently  have  recourse,  and  let  us  bow  down,  in  penitence  exclaiming, 
from  the  bottom  of  our  souls:  O  Sovereign  Lady,  help  us,  having  compas- 
sion upon  us!  Make  haste  to  help,  for  we  perish  with  the  multitude  of 
our  sins;  turn  not  thy  servants  empty  away:  for  we  have  thee  as  our  only 
hope.     (Twice.)     Glory     .  .  now,  and  ever  .     . 

Never,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  will  we  unworthy  ones  cease  to  proclaim 
thy  powers:  for  if  thou  didst  not  come  to  our  aid,  making  intercession,  who 


THE  LESSER  BLESSING  OF  WATER  47I 

would  deliver  us  from  our  manifold  adversities?  Who  would  have  pre- 
served us  free  unto  this  day?  We  will  not  forsake  thee,  O  Lady:  for  thou 
ever  savest  thy  servants  from  all  ruthless  foes. 

Then  Psalm  li.:  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,       .  (See  page  380.) 

Then  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari)  are  sung,  in  Tone  VI. 

O  Virgin  who  didst  receive  from  the  Angel  "Hail!"  and  didst  there- 
after give  birth  to  thy  Creator,  save  thou  those  who  magnify  thee. 

(This  First  Hymn  is  sung  twice.) 

We  sing  thy  Son,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  cry  aloud:  From  all  ad- 
versities save  thou  thy  servants,  O  Lady  all-pure. 

The  Eulogy  of  kings,  prophets,  apostles  and  martyrs  art  thou,  and 
Intercessor  for  the  world,  O  АН-undefiled  One. 

Every  tongue  of  right  believers  laudeth,  and  blesseth,  and  glorifieth 
thine  all-pure  birth-giving,  O  Mary,  Bride  of  God. 

Give  unto  me  also,  though  unworthy,  O  my  Christ,  remission  of  my 
trespasses,  I  beseech  thee,  through  the  prayers  of  her  who  hath  borne 
thee,  in  that  thou  art  compassionate. 

Upon  thee  have  I  set  my  trust,  O  Birth-giver  of  God :  save  me  by  thy 
prayers,  granting  unto  me  remission  of  my  sins. 

Quicken  me,  O  thou  who  hast  borne  the  Life-giver  and  Saviour:  save, 
through  thy  prayers,  O  Blessed  Hope  of  our  souls. 

O  Virgin  undefiled,  who  didst  conceive  in  thy  womb  the  Creator  of  all 
men,  through  thy  prayers,  save  thou  our  souls. 

O  Birth-giver  of  God  all-lauded,  who  through  the  word  of  the  Angel, 
in  manner  which  no  word  can  utter,  didst  give  birth  to  the  Word,  pray 
thou  the  Same  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Through  thy  prayers,  O  Lady,  make  thou  thy  Son  to  be  a  merciful 
judge  of  me  who  am  a  sinner  above  all  other  men. 

In  duty  bound  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee:  Hail,  O  pure  Birth-giver  of 
God  ever- virgin !     Through  thy  prayers  are  saved  those  who  pray. 

Deliver  me  from  fire  eternal,  and  the  torments  which  await  me,  O 
Birth-giver  of  God,  forasmuch  as  I  magnify  thee. 

Despise  not  the  petitions  of  thy  servants,  we  beseech  thee,  O  All-praised 
Lady,  that  we  may  be  delivered  from  every  assault. 

From  infirmities  and  every  malady  deliver  thou  us,  who  have  recourse 
to  thy  holy  protection. 

Marvellous  was  the  wonder  shown  in  thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God :  For 
for  our  sakes  the  Creator  of  all  and  our  God  was  born  of  thee,  and  like 
unto  us. 

Thy  temple,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  was  shown  forth  a  remedy  without 
price  for  ills,  and  a  consolation  for  wounded  souls. 

O  Birth-giver  of  God  all-holy,  who  hast  borne  the  Saviour,  save  thou 
thy  servants  from  all  adversities  and  from  all  other  necessities. 


472  THE  LESSER  BLESSING  OF  WATER 

Deliver  thy  servants  from  every  ban  under  which  they  lie,  and  from 
every  ailment,  both  spiritual  and  bodily,  O  Lady  all-holy. 

Through  thy  prayers,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  save  thou  all  who 
have  recourse  unto  thee;  and  deliver  them  from  all  necessity  and  sorrow. 

Who  that  hath  recourse  unto  thy  temple,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  doth 
not  receive  speedy  healing,  both  of  soul  and  of  body,  O  All-pure  One? 

Entreated  by  all  the  high  and  holy  Heavenly  Powers,  O  Bountiful 
One,  through  her  who  hath  borne  thee,  cleanse  thou  me. 

Spare,  O  Saviour,  the  souls  of  our  brethren  who  have  died  in  the  hope 
of  life;  and  loose,  remit  their  sins. 

Hail,  O  Virgin,  Mercy-seat  of  the  world!  Hail,  thou  Haft  and  Can- 
delabrum all-golden,  thou  Manna  and  Light  Divine,  O  Bride  of  God! 

We  sing  thee,  One  God  in  Three  Persons,  crying  aloud  the  Thrice- 
Holy  song,  entreating  that  we  may  receive  salvation. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

O  Virgin,  who  hast  borne  the  Saviour,  and  Sovereign  and  Lord  of  the 
world,  pray  thou  him  that  he  will  save  our  souls. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hail,  O  Mount!  Hail,  O  Bush  that  burned  and  yet  was  not  con- 
sumed! Hail,  O  Gate!  Hail,  O  Ladder!  Hail,  O  Altar  divine!  Hail, 
O  Sovereign  Lady,  the  helper  of  all  men. 

Through  the  prayers  of  thine  all-holy  Mother,  and  of  all  thy  Saints,  O 
Merciful  One,  grant  thy  mercies  unto  thy  people. 

Through  the  prayers  of  the  glorious  Archangels,  and  Angels,  and  of 
the  Heavenly  Hosts,  preserve  thou  mightily  thy  servants,  O  Christ  my 
Saviour. 

Through  the  prayers  of  thine  honourable  and  glorious  Baptist,  Prophet 
and  Forerunner,  and  of  all  thy  Saints,  grant  thou  thy  mercies  unto  thy 
people. 

Through  the  prayers  of  the  glorious  Apostles  and  Martyrs,  and  of  all 
thy  Saints,  grant  thou  thy  mercies  unto  thy  people. 

Through  the  prayers  of  the  glorious  Unmercenaries,  O  Birth-giver  of 
God,  preserve  thou  thy  servants,  in  that  thou  art  the  Intercessor  and  the 
Confirmation  of  the  world. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 

The  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit  do  we  glorify,  saying: 
O  Holy  Trinity,  save  thou  our  souls. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Virgin,  who  in  wise  ineffable  didst,  in  the  latter  days,  conceive  and 
bring  forth  thy  Creator,  save  thou  those  who  magnify  thee. 

Then:  Open  unto  us  the  door  of  thy  loving-kindness,  O  Blessed  Birth- 
giver  of  God.  In  that  we  set  our  hope  on  thee  may  we  not  fail,  but 
through  thee  may  we  be  delivered  from  all  adversities;  for  thou  art  the 
salvation  of  all  Christian  people. 


THE  LESSER  BLESSING  OF  WATER  473 

Then:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Priest.  For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  and  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory, 
honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  these  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  VI. 

Now  is  drawn  nigh  the  time  which  sanctifieth  all  men,  and  a  just 
Judge  awaiteth  us;  but  turn  thou,  O  my  soul,  unto  repentance,  like  the 
adulteress  crying  with  tears:  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord. 

O  Christ,  the  Fountain,  who  dost  bedew  with  the  waters  of  healing,  in 
the  all-honourable  temple  of  the  Virgin,  thou  to-day,  through  the  sprink- 
ling of  thy  blessing,  dost  expel  the  maladies  of  the  ailing,  O  thou 
Physician  of  our  souls  and  bodies. 

As  a  Virgin  who  had  not  known  man  thou  didst  give  birth,  and  as 
Mother  unwedded  a  Virgin  didst  remain,  O  Mary,  Birth-giver  of  God: 
Entreat  thou  Christ  our  God  that  he  will  save  us. 

O  all-holy  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  guide  thou  aright  the  works  of 
our  hands,  and  entreat  thou  pardon  for  our  transgressions,  when  we 
chant  the  angelic  song :  — 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

And  when  the  Thrice-Holy  hath  been  sung,  in  the  usual  manner,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Reader.  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Third  Tone.  The  Lord  is  my 
light  and  my  Saviour;  whom  shall  I  fear? 

Verse:  The  Lord  is  the  defender  of  my  life;  of  whom  shall  I  be  afraid? 

Reader.  The  Lesson  from  the  Epistle  of  the  holy  Apostle  Paul  to  the 
Hebrews. 

(Heb.  ii.  11-18.)  Brethren:  Both  he  that  sanctifieth  and  they  who  are 
sanctified  are  all  of  one:  for  which  cause  he  is  not  ashamed  to  call  them 
brethren;  saying,  I  will  declare  thy  name  unto  all  my  brethren;  in  the 
midst  of  the  church  will  I  sing  praises  unto  thee.  And  again,  I  will  put 
my  trust  in  him.  And  again,  Behold  I  and  the  chijdren  which  God  hath 
given  me.  Forasmuch  then  as  the  children  are  partakers  of  flesh  and 
blood,  he  also  himself  likewise  took  part  of  the  same;  that  through  death 
he  might  destroy  him  that  had  the  power  of  death,  that  is,  the  devil :  and 
deliver  them  who  through  fear  of  death  were  all  their  life-time  subject  to 
bondage.  For  verily  he  took  not  on  him  the  nature  of  angels ;  but  he  took 
on  him  the  seed  of  Abraham.  Wherefore  in  all  things  it  behoved  him  to 
be  made  like  unto  his  brethren,  that  he  might  be  a  merciful  and  faithful 
high  priest  in  things  pertaining  to  God,  to  make  reconciliation  for  the  sins 
of  the  people.  For  in  that  he  himself  hath  suffered  being  tempted,  he  is 
able  to  succour  them  that  are  tempted. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  thee. Reader.  And  with  thy  spirit.

People.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  John. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

{John  v.  1-4.)  At  that  time  Jesus  went  up  to  Jerusalem.  Now  there 
is  at  Jerusalem  by  the  sheep  market,  a  pool,  which  is  called  in  the  Hebrew 
tongue  Bethesda,  having  five  porches.  In  these  lay  a  great  multitude  of 
impotent  folk,  of  blind,  halt,  withered,  waiting  for  the  moving  of  the 
water.  For  an  angel  went  down  at  a  certain  season  into  the  pool,  and 
troubled  the  water:  whosoever  then  first  after  the  troubling  of  the  water 
stepped  in,  was  made  whole  of  whatsoever  disease  he  had. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany  (Ekteniya). 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  this  Prayer: 

0  Lord  our  God,  who  art  mighty  in  counsel,  and  wonderful  in  thy  deeds, 
the  Creator  of  all  things,  who  keepest  thy  covenant  and  thy  mercy  unto 
those  who  love  thee  and  keep  thy  commandments,  and  receivest  the  con- 
trite tears  of  all  who  are  in  distress :  (For  for  this  cause  thou  didst  come 
in  the  similitude  of  a  servant,  scorning  not  our  image,  but  giving  true 
health  to  the  body,  and  saying:  Lo,  thou  art  healed,  sin  no  more;  and 
with  clay  thou  didst  make  the  man's  eyes  whole,  and  having  commanded 
him  to  wash,  didst  make  him,  by  thy  word,  to  rejoice  in  the  light,  putting 
to  confusion  the  floods  of  passion  of  enemies,  and  drying  up  the  bitter  sea 
of  the  life  of  the  same,  and  subduing  the  waves  of  sensual  desires  heavy 
to  be  endured) :  Do  thou,  the  same  King  who  lovest  mankind,  who  hast 
granted  unto  us  to  clothe  ourselves  in  the  garment  of  snowy  whiteness, 
by  water  and  the  Spirit,  send  down  upon  us  thy  blessing,  through  par- 
taking of  this  water,  and  through  sprinkling  therewith,  washing  away

Save,  O  Lord,  and  have  mercy  upon  the  Most  Holy  Synod  {or  the

Lord,  both  those  who  hate  us,  and  those  who  love  us,  the  brethren  who 
serve  with  us,  the  people  who  are  here  present,  and  those  who  for  a 
cause  worthy  of  blessing  have  gone  forth  and  have  empowered  us,  un- 
worthy though  we  be,  to  pray  for  them.  Have  in  remembrance,  O  Lord, 
our  brethren  who  are  in  captivity  and  affliction,  and  show  mercy  upon 
them,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  delivering  them  from  all  distress.

And  the  Priest  saith,  secretly,  this  Prayer: 

Bow  thine  ear,  and  hearken  unto  us,  O  Lord,  who  didst  deign  to 
be  baptized  in  Jordan,  and  didst  sanctify  the  water:  and  bless  all 
of  us  who  by  the  bowing  of  our  necks  do  show  forth  our  apprehen- 
sion that  we  are  thy  servants ;  and  grant  that  we  may  be  filled  with 
thy  sanctification,  through  partaking  of  this  water;  and  let  it  be  to 
us,  O  Lord,  for  the  health  of  soul  and  body.

beginning,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  honourable  cross,  he  blesseth  the  water  thrice,  in  cross-form,  dipping 
it  and  moving  it  in  due  fashion,  and  chanting  the  following  Hymn  {Tropdr)  in 
Tone  I.     (Thrice.) 

O  Lord,  save  thy  people  and  bless  thine  inheritance,  granting  to  the 
most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  victory  over  all  adversaries,  and  by  thy 
Cross  preserving  thine  Estate. 

Then  the  following  Hymn,  in  Tone  II.,  is  sung: 
Make  us  worthy  of  thy  gifts,  O  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God,  disregarding 
our  transgressions,  and   bestowing  healing,   through  faith,  upon  those 
who  accept  thy  blessing,  O  All-pure  One. 

Then  the  Priest  kisseth  the  honourable  cross,  and  so  do  likewise  all  the  people;  and  he 
sprinkleth  them  all  with  the  holy  water,  and  all  the  Sanctuary  and  the  Church. 
And  the  people  sing  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari),  in  Tone  IV.: 

O  holy  Unmercenaries,  who  have  a  fountain  of  healing,  give  ye  healing 
unto  all  who  ask  it,  in  that  ye  have  been  vouchsafed  gifts  most  excellent 
from  the  everflowing  fountain  our  Saviour.  For  the  Lord  saith  unto 
you,  as  unto  your  fellow-zealots  the  Apostles:  Lo,  I  have  given  unto  you 
power  over  unclean  spirits,  that  ye  may  drive  them  out,  and  heal  every 
infirmity,  and  every  wound.  Wherefore,  abiding  fully  in  that  command, 
freely  ye  have  received,  freely  do  ye  give,  healing  the  passions  of  our 
souls  and  bodies. 

Have  regard  to  the  prayers  of  thy  servants,  O  All-undefiled  One,  allay- 
ing the  fierce  risings  against  us,  assuaging  our  every  woe;  for  in  that  we 
have  thee  as  a  confirmation  certain  and  renowned,  and  have  acquired 
thy  intercession,  we  shall  not  be  put  to  shame,  O  Lady,  when  we  call 
upon  thee.  Strive  thou  earnestly  for  the  petition  of  those  who  faithfully 
cry  unto  thee:  Hail,  O  Lady,  O  Help  of  all  men,  O  Joy  and  Protection 
and  Salvation  of  our  souls. 

Receive,  O  Lady,  the  prayers  of  thy  servants,  and  deliver  us  from 
every  distress  and  sorrow. 

And  after  the  Sprinkling,  the  Litany  (Ekteniya). 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  beseech 
thee:. hearken,  and  have  mercy  - 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Furthermore  we  pray  that  he  will  preserve  this  city  and  this  holy 
Temple,  and  every  city  and  land  from  pestilence,  famine,  earthquake, 
flood,  fire,  the  sword,  the  invasion  of  enemies,  and  from  civil  war:  and 


478  THE  LESSER  BLESSING  OF  WATER 

that  our  good  God,  who  loveth  mankind,  will  be  graciously  favourable 
and  easy  to  be  entreated,  and  will  turn  away  from  us  all  the  wrath  stirred 
up  against  us,  and  deliver  us  from  all  his  righteous  chastisement  which 
impendeth  against  us,  and  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Forty  times.) 

Then  the  Priest  exclaimeth: 

Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the  earth,  and 
of  those  who  are  far  off  upon  the  sea;  and  show  mercy,  show  mercy,  O 
Master,  upon  our  sins,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God  and  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Let  us  bow  our  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest  readeth,  in  a  loud  voice,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  greatly  merciful  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  favourably 
fulfil  our  prayer;  through  the  prayers  of  our  all-pure  Birth-giver  of  God 
and  ever- virgin  Mary;  through  the  might  of  the  honourable  and  life- 
giving  Cross;  through  the  intercession  of  the  honourable  Bodiless  Powers

John ;  of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles ;  of  the  holy,  glorious

menical  great  teachers  and  saints,  Basil  the  Great,  Gregory  the  Theologian, 
and  John  Chrysostom;  of  our  Father  among  the  Saints,  Nicholas,  Arch- 
bishop of  Myra  in  Lycia,  the  Wonder-worker;  (of  our  Holy  Fathers  of  All- 
Russia,  Wonder-workers,  Peter,  Alexis,  Jonah  and  Philip) ;  of  the  right- 
eous Ancestors  of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna  {and  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the 
Temple) ;  and  of  all  thy  Saints:  Grant  us  remission  of  our  sins.  Cover  us 
with  the  shelter  of  thy  wing;  root  out  from  us  every  foe  and  adversary; 
render  tranquil  our  life;  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  thy  world,  O  Lord,  and 
save  our  souls,  forasmuch  that  thou  art  gracious  and  lovest  mankind. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Benediction. 

May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  all-holy  Mother, 
and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  for  he  is  good  and 
loveth  mankind. 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A 

CHURCH 

(the  laying  of  the  corner-stone) 

No  one  may  found  a  church,  either  of  stone  or  of  wood,  except  the  Bishop  himself, 
or  an  Archpriest  or  one  of  the  Priests  whom  it  shall  please  him  to  send,  with  his 
special  blessing,  for  that  purpose.  But  if  any  one  shall  dare  to  begin  the  building 
of  a  church  without  the  Bishop's  blessing,  he  shall  incur  the  penalty  of  being  de- 
posed, as  a  contemner  of  the  Bishop's  authority. 

And  the  Founding  shall  be  after  this  wise:  If  the  church  is  to  be  of  stone,  trenches  are 
dug  at  the  place  where  the  corner-stone  is  to  be  laid,  and  stones  and  mortar  shall  be 
prepared;  and  on  one  square  stone  there  shall  be  depicted  or  carved  a  cross;  and 
below  the  cross  (if  the  Bishop  or  his  representative  so  desireth),  a  place  shall  be 
prepared  for  the  insertion  of  Holy  Relics.  And  the  following  inscription  shall  be 
put  on  the  stone:  In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  this  church  is  founded,  in  honour  and  memory  of  {here  the  name  of  a 
Feast,  or  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Temple  is  inserted) ;  in  the  rule  of  the  most 
God-fearing  Ruler,  N.  If  it  be  in  a  foreign  land,  the  title  and  name  of  the  Ruler 
are  here  inserted) ;  in  the  Episcopacy  of  the  Right  {or  Most)  Reverend  N.,  of 
N.;  in  the  Year  of  the  World  .  ,  and  from  the  Birth  in  the  flesh  of  God  the 
Word         (with  the  month  and  day). 

A  church  may  be  founded  without  the  Relics  of  a  Saint  and  the  above-mentioned 
inscription,  but  not  without  the  square  stone.  In  addition  to  this,  a  large  wooden 
cross  is  prepared,  and  this  cross  is  planted  in  a  trench  dug  at  the  spot  where  the 
altar  is  to  be. 

But  if  the  church  is  to  be  of  wood,  no  excavations  are  made,  with  the  exception  of  one 
under  the  wall  of  the  Sanctuary,  at  the  eastern  extremity,  wherein  to  set  the  square 
stone,  and  another  for  the  planting  of  the  cross  at  the  spot  where  the  altar  is  to  be. 
The  beams,  or  planks  whereon  the  church  is  to  rest,  are  also  prepared. 

All  these  preparations  having  been  made,  the  Bishop  or  his  representative,  having 
vested  himself  in  the  church  which  is  nearest  the  place  where  the  Laying  of  the 
corner-stone  is  to  be,  cometh  forth  with  all  the  clergy,  preceded  by  a  Deacon  with 
the  censer,  and  a  Priest  with  the  cross,  two  and  two.  And  the  clergy  chant  the 
Stanzas  (Stikhiri)  of  the  Litiyd  *  for  the  Temple  of  the  future  church.  And  on 
arriving  at  the  place,  they  lay  upon  the  table  there  prepared  the  book  of  the  Holy 
Gospels,  and  the  cross;  and  the  Rector,  having  taken  the  censer,  and  having  censed 
therewith  the  table,  in  cross-form,  thrice,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Bless,  Master. 

And  the  Rector  beginneth,  as  usual: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save 
our  souls,  O  Good  One.

And  until  the  singing  is  finished,  the  Rector  standeth  in  front  of  the  book  of  the  Holy 
Gospels,  censing  it.  Then  he  censeth  all  the  trenches,  where  the  foundation  is  to  lie, 
beginning  from  the  first  wall  of  the  Sanctuary,  and  proceeding  against  the  sun, 
until  he  cometh  back  to  the  place  whence  he  began.  Then  he  censeth  the  Clergy  and 
the  People.     And  the  Reader  readeth: 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     {Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Glory         now,  and  ever, 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver 
us  from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 

Psalm  cxliii. 
Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  consider  my  desire;  hearken  unto  me 
for  thy  truth  and  righteousness'  sake.  And  enter  not  into  judgment 
with  thy  servant;  for  in  thy  sight  shall  no  man  living  be  justified.  For 
the  enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul;  he  hath  smitten  my  life  down  to 
the  ground;  he  hath  laid  me  in  the  darkness,  as  the  men  that  have  been 
long  dead.  Therefore  is  my  spirit  vexed  within  me,  and  my  heart  within 
me  is  desolate.  Yet  do  I  remember  the  time  past;  I  muse  upon  all  thy 
works;  yea,  I  exercise  myself  in  the  works  of  thy  hands.  I  stretch  forth 
my  hands  unto  thee;  my  soul  gaspeth  unto  thee  as  a  thirsty  land.  Hear 
me,  O  Lord,  and  that  soon;  for  my  spirit  waxeth  faint:  hide  not  thy  face 
from  me,  lest  I  be  like  unto  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit.  O  let  me 
hear  thy  loving-kindness  betimes  in  the  morning;  for  in  thee  is  my  trust: 
show  thou  me  the  way  that  I  should  walk  in ;  for  I  lift  up  my  soul  unto 
thee.  Deliver  me,  O  Lord,  from  mine  enemies;  for  I  flee  unto  thee  to 
hide  me.  Teach  me  to  do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee;  for  thou  art  my 
God :  let  thy  loving  Spirit  lead  me  forth  into  the  land  of  righteousness. 
Quicken  me,  O  Lord,  for  thy  Name's  sake;  and  for  thy  righteousness*

mies, and  destroy  all  them  that  vex  my  soul ;  for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.

unto  Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Rector  maketh  the  Exclamation: 
For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of

Choir.  Amen. 

And  the  Choir  chanteth: 

God  is  the  Lord,  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us.  .  .  .  (And  the  Verses. 
See  page  515.) 

If  the  Temple  is  to  be  named  after  the  Lord,  this  is  sung  in  the  Tone  of  the  Hymn  for 
the  Feast;  and  after  the  Hymn  for  the  Day,  at  the  Glory  the  Hymn  of  the  Feast 
of  Foundation  is  sung:  at  the  Now,  and  ever,  the  Flymn  of  the  Feast. 

But  if  the  Temple  is  not  to  be  named  after  the  Lord,  then  the  God  is  the  Lord  is  sung 
in  Tone  II.,  and  the  Hymn  of  Foundation: 

O  God,  the  Maker  and  Creator  of  all  things,  speedily  guide  aright 
with  thy  blessing  the  work  of  our  hands,  which  hath  been  begun  unto 
thy  glory,  and  through  thy  might  bring  thou  the  same  presently  unto 
completion;  forasmuch  as  thou  alone  art  almighty,  and  alone  lovest 
mankind. 

But  if  the  Temple  is  to  he  named  after  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  the  Hymn  of  Foundation 
is  sung  twice,  repeating  at  the  Glory         the  Hymn  of  the  Temple.

(See  page  380.)

Then  two  vessels  are  brought  and  placed  on  the  table,  one  containing  pure  water  and 
the  other  oil.  And  when  the  Psalm  is  finished,  the  following  Hymn  is  sung,  in 
Tone  VI.,  thrice: 

Send  down  grace  from  heaven,  O  Life-giver,  and  sanctify  this  water, 
and  show  it  to  be  a  purification  of  all  uncleanness. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir,  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Rector  readeth  over  the  water  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God  greatly-exalted,  the  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  alone 
workest  wonders  which  cannot  be  numbered:  whose  voice  is  on  many 
waters,  and  beholding  whom  the  waters  are  afraid,  and  the  deeps  are 
thrown  into  confusion,  and  the  water  roareth  greatly;  whose  way  is  in 
the  sea,  and  his  path  in  the  great  waters,  and  his  footsteps  are  not  known ; 
Who,  through  the  baptism  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son  incarnate,  and  the 
descent  upon  him  of  the  all-holy  Spirit  in  the  form  of  a  dove,  and  thy 
voice  as  the  Father  hast  sanctified  the  streams  of  Jordan :  To  thee  do  we, 
thine  unworthy  servants,  now  make  our  supplications,  and  implore  thee; 
Send  thou  the  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit  upon  this  water,  and  with  thy 
heavenly  benediction  bless,  purify  and  hallow  it,  and  give  unto  it  the 
grace  and  the  blessing  of  Jordan,  and  the  might  which  purifieth  all  un- 
cleanness, and  healeth  every  infirmity,  and  expelleth  the  assaults  of  all 
demons  and  their  snares.  And  show  it  forth  through  the  power,  and 
effectual  operation,  and  grace  of  the  all-holy  Spirit,  unto  all  thy  servants 
who,  with  faith,  shall  drink  of  the  same,  receive  it,  and  be  sprinkled 
therewith,  to  be  for  a  remission  of  sins,  a  release  from  passions,  an  expel- 
ling of  every  evil  thing,  an  increase  of  virtue,  a  healing  of  infirmity,  and  a 
blessing  to  homes  and  to  every  place,  a  driving  away  of  all  hurtful  and 
pernicious  breezes,  and  the  acquirement  of  thy  grace.  For  thou  art  he 
who  blesseth  and  sanctifieth  all  things,  O  our  God,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thine  all-holy, 
good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now.  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Priest  readeth,  secretly,  this  Prayer: 

Incline  thine  ear,  O  Lord,  and  hear  me,  thou  who  didst  sanctify 
the  waters  of  Jordan  by  the  manifestation  of  thy  Christ;  and  bless 
all  us  who,  by  the  bending  of  our  necks,  express  obedience  unto 
thee;  and  enable  us  to  fulfil  thy  sanctification  by  the  reception  of 
this  water;  and  may  the  same  be  unto  us  for  health  to  our  souls 
and  bodies. 

Exclamation.  For  thou  art  our  sanctification,  and  unto  thee  do  we

ascribe  glory,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thine  all-holy, 
and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

And  the  Rector,  taking  the  cross,  dippeth  it  in  the  water,  in  cross-form,  chanting  the 
Hymn,  in  Tone  VIII.: 

O  Lord,  save  thy  people  and  bless  thine  inheritance,  granting  to  our 
most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  victory  over  all  adversaries,  and  by  thy 
Cross  preserving  thine  Estate.     {Thrice.) 

Then  he  blesseth  the  oil,  thrice,  with  his  right  hand,  saying: 
In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Priest  then  reciteth  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  God  of  our  fathers,  unto  whom  the  pouring  out  of  the  oil  that 
Jacob  poured  upon  the  stone,  which  he  set  up  for  a  pillar  and  called  the 
house  of  God,  was  well-pleasing  and  acceptable:  Look  thou  now  also,  in 
mercy,  we  beseech  thee,  upon  this  oil,  and  bless  it  with  thy  heavenly 
blessing,  and  sanctify  it  and  bestow  upon  it  power  through  the  grace  of 
thine  all-holy  Spirit,  that  every  thing  which  shall  be  anointed  therewith  to 
thy  glory  may  be  consecrated  and  blessed,  well-pleasing  and  acceptable 
unto  thee:  Through  the  bounties  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom 
thou  art  glorified,  together  with  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Rector  taketh  the  holy  water,  and  sprinkleth  therewith  the  place  where  the 
cross  is  to  be  planted,  saying: 

Graciously  vouchsafe,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  with  the  dread 
emblem  and  might  of  thy  Cross  to  guard  this  place,  to  the  glory  of  thee, 
our  crucified  God,  and  of  thy  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  of 
thine  all-holy  Spirit:  and  may  the  all-pernicious  Angel  and  adverse  powers 
withdraw  therefrom.  For  thine  is  the  majesty,  and  thine  are  the  king- 
dom and  the  power  and  the  glory  of  our  great  God  and  Saviour  Jesus 
Christ,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  the  Priests,  taking  the  cross,  plant  it  in  the  place  which  hath  been  prepared  for  it, 
chanting,  with  the  Rector,  this  Hymn,  in  Tone  II.: 

Through  the  planting  of  the  cross  on  earth  hath  the  assault  of  foes 
perished  and  been  utterly  annulled:  and  man,  who  before  was  cast  out, 
entereth  again  into  Paradise:  But  glory  to  thee,  our  only  God,  for  so  was 
it  well-pleasing  unto  thee. 

Then  they  sing  the  Collect-Hymn  (Konddk)  for  the  Foundation,  in  Tone  VI.: 
O  thou  who  art  speedy  to  succour  and  strong  to  help,  manifest  thyself 
now  through  the  grace  of  thy  might,  and  having  blessed,  strengthen, 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH        485 

and  bring  to  an  auspicious  conclusion  the  works  of  thy  servants:  For 
whatsoever  things  thou  wiliest  thou  canst  perform,  in  that  thou  art  God 
Almighty. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Protection  of  Christians  that  maketh  not  ashamed,  O  Mediatrix 
never-failing  with  the  Creator:  Despise  not  the  sinners'  voice  of  supplica- 
tion; but  in  that  thou  art  good,  come  speedily  to  the  aid  of  us  who  faith- 
fully call  upon  thee;  make  haste  to  our  petition  and  further  our  prayer, 
0  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  ever  protectest  them  that  do  thee  honour. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy - 

The  Rector  then  readeth  the  following  Prayer,  in  front  of  the  cross  which  hath  been 
planted,  looking  toward  the  east  the  while: 

O  Lord  God  Almighty,  who  didst  foreshadow  by  the  staff  of  Moses  the 
precious  and  life-giving  Cross  of  thy  beloved  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ: 
Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  bless  and  sanctify  this  place,  through  the  power 
and  effectual  operation  of  that  precious  and  life-giving  Tree  (upon  which 
thou  hast  bestowed  a  sprinkling  of  the  precious  blood  of  thy  Son),  unto 
the  expelling  of  demons,  and  of  every  adverse  power,  preserving  this 
place,  and  those  who  shall  serve  thee  here  unhurt  of  every  evil  thing; 
through  the  prayers  of  our  all-glorious  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever- 
virgin  Mary,  and  of  Saint  N.  {the  Saint  who  is  to  be  the  Patron  of  the 
Temple) . 

For  blessed  and  glorified  be  thy  kingdom,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

The  Rector  then  goeth  to  the  trench  where  the  laying  of  the  corner-stone  is  to  take  place, 
and  the  square  stone  which  hath  been  prepared  lieth  before  him  on  a  table.  And  the 
Choir  singeth: 

Psalm  lxxxiv. 

O  how  amiable  are  thy  dwellings,  thou  Lord  of  hosts!  My  soul  hath  a 
desire  and  longing  to  enter  into  the  courts  of  the  Lord;  my  heart  and 
my  flesh  rejoice  in  the  living  God.  Yea,  the  sparrow  hath  found  her  an 
house,  and  the  swallow  a  nest,  where  she  may  lay  her  young;  even  thy 
altars,  O  Lord  of  hosts,  my  King  and  my  God.  Blessed  are  they  that 
dwell  in  thy  house;  they  will  be  alway  praising  thee.  Blessed  is  the  man 
whose  strength  is  in  thee ;  in  whose  heart  are  thy  ways.  Who  going 
through  the  vale  of  misery  use  it  for  a  well ;  and  the  pools  are  filled  with 
water.  They  will  go  from  strength  to  strength,  and  unto  the  God  of 
gods  appeareth  every  one  of  them  in  Zion.  O  Lord  God  of  hosts,  hear 
my  prayer;  hearken,  O  God  of  Jacob.  Behold,  O  God  our  defender,  and 
look  upon  the  face  of  thine  Anointed.  For  one  day  in  thy  courts  is  better 
than  a  thousand.    I  had  rather  be  a  door-keeper  in  the  house  of  my  God, 


486        THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH 

than  to  dwell  in  the  tents  of  ungodliness.  For  the  Lord  God  is  a  light  and 
defence ;  the  Lord  will  give  grace  and  worship ;  and  no  good  thing  shall  he 
withhold  from  them  that  live  a  godly  life.  O  Lord  God  of  hosts,  blessed  is 
the  man  that  putteth  his  trust  in  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia.     {Thrice.) 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir    Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Recto?  then  readeth  over  the  stone  this  Prayer: 
O  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  the  living  God,  who  art  the  true  God  and 
the  Brightness  and  Image  of  the  Father  which  is  from  everlasting,  and  the 
Life  Everlasting;  and  art  the  Corner-stone,  hewn  without  the  aid  of  seed 
of  man  from  the  Virgin  Mount;  as  also  the  Foundation  immovable  of  thy 
Church;  who  also,  through  the  shedding  of  thy  precious  blood,  hast 
founded  thy  Church,  and  hast  raised  it  up  by  thy  death,  and  perfected  it 
by  thy  Resurrection  and  blessed  it  by  thine  Ascension,  and  hast  sanctified 
and  enlarged  it  by  the  descent  of  thy  Holy  Spirit :  Unto  thee  do  we  now 
humbly  pray :  Send  down  the  grace  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  bless  the  lay- 
ing of  this  stone,  and  all  the  foundation  of  the  building  which  is  now  begun 
to  the  glory  of  thine  all-holy  Name  (and  if  it  be  a  Feast  of  the  Lord,  he 
saith:)  and  in  honour  and  memory  of  thy  holy  (Nativity,  or  whatever  it 
may  be;  or:  of  the  Falling-asleep  (Assumption)  of  thine  all-holy  Mother, 
or  of  whatsoever  other  Feast  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God  or  Saint  it  may  be, 
mentioning  it  by  name).  And  be  thou,  who  art  the  Alpha  and  the  Omega, 
the  beginning  and  the  end,  who  from  eternity  hast  created  all  things,  the 
beginning,  the  increase,  and  the  completion  of  this  work ;  bless  the  ward- 
ens and  the  workers,  and  prosper  thou  the  work  of  their  hands,  and  by 
thy  divine  providence  abundantly  multiply  all  things  necessary  for  the 
building  and  completion  of  this  Temple :  that  the  Temple  may  be  perfect 
and  filled  with  thy  glory,  and  that  in  it  may  be  glorified  thy  great  and  all- 
holy  Name,  together  with  thy  Father  and  thine  all-holy  Spirit,  always, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

And  the  Principal  Priest,  taking  the  holy  water,  sprinkleth  the  stone  therewith,  say- 
ing: 

This  stone  is  blessed  through  the  sprinkling  of  this  holy  water,  unto 
the  foundation  imperishable  of  the  Temple  erected  in  the  Name  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

And  if  the  relics  of  Saints  are  to  be  inserted,  one  of  the  Priests  readeth  the  inscription, 
and  layeth  the  relics  in  the  place  prepared  for  them,  saying: 

O  praise  God  in  his  saints,  praise  him  in  the  firmament  of  his  power, 
For  the  righteous  shall  praise  thee  in  glory,  and  shall  rejoice  on  their  beds 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH        487 

And  when  he  hath  said  this,  he  cover eth  them.  But  if  there  be  no  relics,  nothing  of  this 
is  done.  And  the  Rector,  taking  the  stone  in  his  hands,  layeth  it  in  the  mortar 
which  is  prepared  in  the  trench,  saying: 

This  Church  is  founded  to  the  glory  of  our  great  God  and  Saviour 
Jesus  Christ,  in  honour  and  memory  of  {the  name  of  the  Feast  of  the  Lord,  or 
of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  or  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Temple) ,  in  the  Name 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then,  taking  the  oil,  he  saith: 
The  Most  High  God,  who  hath  founded  this  Church,  is  in  the  midst  of 
it,  and  it  shall  not  be  removed.     God  shall  help  it,  and  that  right  early. 

And  he  pour  eth  the  oil  on  the  stone,  set  in  its  place,  saying: 
Blessed  and  illustrious  be  this  place  for  a  house  of  prayer,  to  the 
honour  and  glory  of  God,  glorified  in  the  Holy  Trinity,  of  the  Father,  and 
of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Amen. 

Then,  with  the  whole  Choir,  he  singeth  the  following,  in  Tone  VI.: 
Jacob  rose  up  early  in  the  morning,  and  took  the  stone  that  he  had  put 
for  his  pillow,  and  set  it  up  for  a  pillar,  and  poured  oil  upon  the  top  of  it, 
and  said :  Surely,  the  Lord  is  in  this  place,  and  I  knew  it  not;  how  dreadful 
is  this  place!  this  is  none  other  but  the  house  of  God,  and  this  is  the  gate 
of  heaven. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia. 

If  the  foundation  be  for  a  wooden  church,  when  all  the  foregoing  hath  been  performed, 
the  Rector,  taking  an  axe,  smiteth  it  thrice  into  the  central  beam  of  the  Sanctuary, 
saying:  » 

This  work  is  begun  in  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  in  honour  and  memory  of  (the  name  of  wooden 
the  Feast  or  of  the  Saint).     Amen. 

Then  he  beginneth  to  sprinkle  all  the  foundations  round  about,  starting  from  the 

northern  side,  against  the  sun,  and  saying: 
In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit- 
Amen. 

While  the  Choir  singeth  Psalm  lxxxvii- 

Her  foundations  are  upon  the  holy  hills :  the  Lord  loveth  the  gates  of 
Zion  more  than  all  the  dwellings  of  Jacob.  Very  excellent  things  are 
spoken  of  thee,  thou  city  of  God.  I  will  think  upon  Rahab  and  Babylon, 
with  them  that  know  me.  Behold,  yea  the  Philistines  also,  and  they  of 
Tyre,  with  the  Morians;  lo,  there  was  he  born.  And  of  Zion  it  shall  be 
reported  that  he  was  born  in  her;  and  the  Most  High  shall  stablish  her. 
The  Lord  shall  rehearse  it,  when  he  writeth  up  the  people,  that  he  was 
born  there.  The  singers  also  and  trumpeters  shall  he  rehearse:  All  my 
fresh  springs  shall  be  in  thee.

And  the  workman  shall  immediately  begin  their  labour  with  speed,  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord.  And  when  the  Rector  hath  passed  over  the  first  portion  of  the  foundation,  on 
the  northern  side,  he  shall  stand  with  his  face  to  the  north;  and  when  the  Psalm  is 
finished,  and  the  Deacon  hath  said:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord:  and  the  Choir  hath 
answered:  Lord,  have  mercy: 

The  Rector  shall  read  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  made  the  North  and  the  sea,  and  all  things; 
whom  heaven  and  earth  are  not  able  to  contain ;  who  didst  deign  to  have 
for  thyself  on  earth  a  Temple  for  the  perpetual  praise  of  thine  all-holy 
Name:  Humbly  falling  down  before  thee  we  entreat  thy  loving-kindness: 
bless  thou  the  foundations  of  this  Temple,  and  its  whole  edifice;  and  es- 
tablish it  by  thy  might,  and  make  it  immovable  and  impregnable,  to  the 
glory  of  thee,  the  only  God  glorified  in  the  Trinity,  to  the  Father,  and  to 
the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  if  the  church  is  to  be  of  wood,  he  taketh  the  axe  again, 
Church!  and  smiteth  therewith  the  central  beam,  saying  the  same  as  at  the  first 

smiting. 

Then  he  goeth  on,  sprinkling  the  second  portion  of  the  foundation,  and  saying: 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen. 

And  the  Choir  chanteth  Psalm  cxxvii 

Except  the  Lord  build  the  house,  their  labour  is  but  lost  that  build  it. 
Except  the  Lord  keep  the  city,  the  watchman  waketh  but  in  vain.  It  is 
but  lost  labour  that  ye  haste  to  rise  up  early,  and  so  late  take  rest,  and  eat 
the  bread  of  carefulness;  for  so  he  giveth  his  beloved  sleep.  Lo,  children, 
and  the  fruit  of  the  womb,  are  an  heritage  and  gift  that  cometh  of  the 
Lord.  Like  as  the  arrows  in  the  hand  of  the  giant,  even  so  are  the  young 
children.  Happy  is  the  man  that  hath  his  quiver  full  of  them;  they  shall 
not  be  ashamed  when  they  speak  with  their  enemies  in  the  gate. 

And  having  come  to  the  western  side,  and  standing  with  his  face  toward  the  west,  after 
the  Psalm  is  finished,  and  the  Deacon  hath  said:  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord:  and  the 
Choir  hath  responded:  Lord,  have  mercy:  the  Rector  reciteth  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  whose  Name  is  praised  from  the  rising  of  the  sun  even 
unto  the  going  down  of  the  same,  and  who,  by  thy  divine  providence, 
hast  chosen  this  place  for  an  abode  for  thyself:  Send  now,  we  humbly  pray 
thee,  thy  heavenly  blessing  upon  it,  and  bless  the  beginning  of  this 
building,  and  strengthen  and  establish  it,  and  bring  it  to  successful  com- 
pletion. For  thou  art  he  who  doeth  all  things  for  the  profit  of  our  souls, 
and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to 
the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH        489 

And  after  this  Prayer,  he  again  smiteth  thrice  with  the  axe,  if  the  church  is  to 

be  of  wood,  saying  the  same  as  before.  Chvxob 

Then  he  goeth  and  sprinkleth  the  third  part  of  the  foundation,  and  saith: 
In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen. 

And  the  Choir  singeth,  the  while,  Psalm  cxxii. 

I  was  glad  when  they  said  unto  me,  We  will  go  into  the  house  of  the 
Lord.  Our  feet  shall  stand  in  thy  gates,  O  Jerusalem.  Jerusalem  is 
built  as  a  city  that  is  at  unity  in  itself.  For  thither  the  tribes' go  up, 
even  the  tribes  of  the  Lord,  to  testify  unto  Israel,  to  give  thanks  unto 
the  Name  of  the  Lord.  For  there  is  the  seat  of  judgment,  even  the  seat 
of  the  house  of  David.  O  pray  for  the  peace  of  Jerusalem,  they  shall 
prosper  that  love  thee.  Peace  be  within  thy  walls,  and  plenteousness 
within  thy  palaces.  For  my  brethren  and  companions'  sakes  I  will  wish 
thee  prosperity.  Yea,  because  of  the  house  of  the  Lord  our  God  I  will 
seek  to  do  thee  good. 

And  coming  to  the  southern  side  of  the  foundation,  and  standing  with  his  face  to  the 
south,  when  the  Psalm  is  finished,  and  the  Deacon  hath  said:  Let  us  pray  to  the 
Lord:  and  the  Choir  hath  responded:  Lord,  have  mercy:  the  Rector  reciteth  this 
Prayer: 

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  didst  come  from  the  south  for  our 
salvation,  and  from  the  shady  Virgin  Mount  as  holy  didst  reveal  thyself, 
and  didst  dwell  among  men:  Look  with  mercy,  we  beseech  thee,  upon 
the  wardens  of  the  Temple,  the  building  whereof  hath  been  begun  in  thy 
Name,  and  bless  them  in  all  things;  and  give  them  strength  and  stead- 
fastness, together  with  vigour  and  abundance  of  health,  and  prosper 
them  in  all  ways,  unto  the  completion  of  the  work  which  hath  been  begun 
to  thy  glory.  For  thou  art  the  God  of  mercy,  and  bounties,  and  of  love 
toward  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy 
Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life- 
giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

After  this  Prayer  he  doth  as  before.  And  he  goeth  and  sprinkleth  the  fourth  portion 
of  the  foundation,  saying: 

In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen. 

While  the  Choir  chanteth  Psalm  cxxxii. 

Lord,  remember  David,  and  all  his  trouble:  how  he  sware  unto  the 
Lord,  and  vowed  a  vow  unto  the  Almighty  God  of  Jacob;  I  will  not  come 
within  the  tabernacle  of  mine  house,  nor  climb  up  into  my  bed ;  I  will 
not  suffer  mine  eyes  to  sleep,  nor  mine  eyelids  to  slumber;  neither  the 
temples  of  my  head  to  take  any  rest;  until  I  find  out  a  place  for  the  tem- 
ple of  the  Lord;  an  habitation  for  the  Mighty  God  of  Jacob.  Lo,  we 
heard  of  the  same  at  Ephrata,  and  found  it  in  the  wood.     We  will  go 


490        THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH 

into  his  tabernacle,  and  fall  low  on  our  knees  before  his  footstool.  Arise, 
O  Lord,  into  thy  resting-place;  thou,  and  the  ark  of  thy  strength.  Let 
thy  priests  be  clothed  with  righteousness;  and  let  thy  saints  sing  with 
joyfulness.  For  thy  servant  David's  sake,  turn  not  away  the  presence 
of  thine  Anointed.  The  Lord  hath  made  a  faithful  oath  unto  David, 
and  he  shall  not  shrink  from  it;  of  the  fruit  of  thy  body  shall  I  set  upon 
thy  seat.  If  thy  children  will  keep  my  covenant,  and  my  testimonies 
that  I  shall  learn  them;  their  children  also  shall  sit  upon  thy  seat  for- 
evermore.  For  the  Lord  hath  chosen  Zion  to  be  an  habitation  for  him- 
self; he  hath  longed  for  her.  This  shall  be  my  rest  forever;  here  will  I 
dwell,  for  I  have  a  delight  therein.  I  will  bless  her  victuals  with  increase: 
and  will  satisfy  her  poor  with  bread.  I  will  deck  her  priests  with  health, 
and  her  saints  shall  rejoice  and  sing.  There  shall  I  make  the  horn  of 
David  to  flourish:  I  have  ordained  a  lantern  for  mine  Anointed.  As  for 
his  enemies,  I  shall  clothe  them  with  shame;  but  upon  himself  shall  his 
crown  flourish. 

And  when  he  is  come  to  the  place  where  he  began  to  sprinkle,  he  stoppeth,  and  standing 
in  front  of  the  cross  planted  in  the  earth,  with  his  face  toward  the  east,  when  the 
Psalm  is  finished,  the  Rector  beginneth,  with  all  emotion,  to  sing,  accompanied  by 
all  the  Choir: 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain;  and  save 
our  souls,  O  Good  One. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Then  the  Rector  readeth  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  deigned  at  this  place,  and  upon  the  stone 
laid  thereon  and  blessed  in  thy  Name,  to  found  for  thyself  a  Church, 
mercifully  accept  those  who  bring  unto  thee  thine  own  of  thine  own, 
for  the  erection  to  thy  glory  of  the  Temple  which  hath  been  founded 
in  honour  and  memory  of  N.  (the  Feast  or  the  Saint) :  Requite  thou  the 
same  with  the  multitude  of  thy  heavenly  and  earthly  good  things;  grant- 
ing also  unto  all  who  shall  lend  their  aid  in  the  building  and  completion 
of  this  church  bodily  health  and  spiritual  salvation.  Strengthen  the 
labourers,  preserving  them  unharmed  of  every  evil  thing;  and  preserve 
these  foundations  indestructible  and  immovable,  and  bring  this  thy 
Temple  speedily  to  completion :  that  therein  unceasingly,  with  all-exalting 
hymns  and  praises  and  unbloody  sacrifices,  we  may  glorify  and  sing 
thee,  our  only  true  God.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and 
worship,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

The  Rector.  Peace  be  with  you  all. Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 


THE  OFFICE  USED  AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  CHURCH       491 
And  the  Deacon,  with  all  emotion,  saith: 
Again,  yet  again,  on  bended  knees  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

And  all  kneel  down.     And  the  Rector,  himself  kneeling,  readeth  with  emotion  this 
Prayer: 

We  praise  thee,  O  Lord  God  of  hosts,  our  Saviour,  that  because  of 
the  great  multitude  of  thy  goodness  and  loving-kindness  toward  man- 
kind, thou  hast  chosen  and  sanctified  this  place,  and  hast  founded  thereon 
a  church  to  the  glory  of  thine  all-holy  Name,  through  us,  thine  unworthy 
servants.  Wherefore,  bowing  the  knees  of  our  souls  and  bodies,  we 
humbly  beseech  thee :  Graciously  vouchsafe  to  found  also  upon  this  place 
an  Altar  for  the  offering  up  of  the  unbloody  sacrifice  of  the  all-holy  Body 
and  the  precious  Blood  of  thy  Christ,  unto  thy  glory,  and  unto  the  salva- 
tion of  our  souls.  And  bring  thou  this  Temple,  and  this  Altar,  which 
have  now  been  begun,  speedily  to  completion  by  thy  divine  might;  that 
therein  and  thereon,  even  until  the  end  of  the  ages,  the  praise  of  thine 
all-holy  Name,  and  thine  unbloody,  supersensual  sacrifices  may  be  offered 
up  and  performed  unto  thee  unceasingly  without  hindrance,  by  thine 
Orthodox  people:  For  with  thee  all  things  are  possible;  and  unto  thee  do 
we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  thine  all-holy, 
and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  all  standing,  the  Deacon  saith  this  Litany: 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy:  fy 

Here  follow  petitions  for  the  Ruler  of  the  Land  and  for  all  the  Authorities,  accord- 
ing to  the  elements  and  nationalities  of  which  the  Parish  is  constituted. 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  our  Most  Holy  Synod  (or  Patriarch) ;  for 
our  Bishop  (or  Archbishop  or  Metropolitan),  N.,  for  the  honourable 
Presbytery,  the  Diaconate  in  Christ;  for  all  the  clergy  and  the 
laity:  1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  that  the  Lord  our  God  will  hearken  unto 
the  voice  of  our  petition,  and  will  bless  the  work  of  our  hands:  and 
let  us  all  say:  O  Lord,  hearken,  and  have  mercy,  fy 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  the  God-fearing  Wardens,  and  for  the 
founders  to  the  glory  of  God,  of  the  Temple,  N.,  which  hath  been 
begun  and  is  to  be  built  to  the  glory  of  God ;  and  for  the  prosperous 
forwarding  of  their  holy  work,  and  for  their  health,  salvation,  and 
the  remission  of  their  sins:  and  let  us  all  say:  O  Lord,  hearken,  and 
have  mercy    1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  that  he  will  appoint  to  this  holy  work  an 
Angel,  a  guardian  against  every  evil  assault  of  foes  both  visible  and 
invisible,  who  shall  deliver  from  impediments,  and  shall  defend  and 
strengthen  the  labourers:  and  let  us  all  say:  O  Lord,  hearken,  and 
have  mercy.  1$

And  the  Rector  exclaimeth: 

Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the  earth,  and 
of  those  who  are  far  off  upon  the  sea;  and  show  mercy,  show  mercy,  O 
Master,  unto  us  sinners,  and  be  merciful  unto  us,  and  unto  the  founders 
of  this  Temple:  For  thou  art  a  merciful  God  and  lovest  mankind,  and 
unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the 
Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  he  pronounceth  the  Benediction  appropriate  to  the  Temple.  And  having  blessed 
the  People,  the  Bishop  or  the  Archpriest,  if  he  hath  come  with  the  Litiyd,  as  said 
above,  retitrneth  also  with  the  Litiyd  to  the  Church  whence  he  hath  come,  while  the 
Choir  sing  the  Stanzas  of  the  Temple,  or  whatsoever  else  they  wish,  to  the  glory 
of  God. 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A 
CHURCH  WHEN  PERFORMED  BY  A  BISHOP  (i)  * 

When  the  Church  is  finished,  there  cometh  a  person,  sent  from  the  Bishop,  one  day  or 
more  beforehand,  and  prepareth  those  things  which  are  necessary  for  the  Consecra- 
tion, not  only  within  the  Sanctuary,  but  also  in  all  the  Church.  And  especially  he 
is  careful  that  the  Altar  shall  stand  upon  four  columns,  with  a  fifth  column  bearing 
a  small  coffer,  in  the  middle;  and  the  coffer  must  be  in  the  centre,  under  the  Altar, 
about  fourteen  inches  high,  and  the  Altar  thirty-eight  inches  in  height,  and  its 
width  in  proportion  to  the  Sanctuary,  and  the  top  of  the  Altar  in  proportion  to  the 
Altar. 

The  Table  of  Oblation,  also,  shall  be  of  the  same  height,  width  and  length,  in  propor- 
tion to  the  Sanctuary.  In  the  top  of  the  Altar-columns  cavities  are  holloived  out,  a 
couple  of  inches  in  depth,  where  the  wax-mastic  is  to  be:  in  these  same  columns,  six 
inches  from,  the  floor,  notches  shall  be  cut  for  holding  the  cord;  and  round  about  the 
table  of  the  Altar,  a  couple  of  inches  from  the  top,  other  such  notches  shall  be  cut,  for 
holding  the  cord;  and  holes  are  to  be  bored  in  the  corners  of  the  tables  for  the  Altar 
and  the  Table  of  Oblation  where  the  nails  are  to  be,  and  hollow  spaces  shall  be  pre- 
pared where  the  heads  of  the  nails  are  to  be,  so  that  the  heads  of  the  nails  may  lie  on  a 
level  with  the  table  of  the  Altar;  and  the  columns  are  to  be  pierced  in  such  a  manner 
that  the  nails  shall  enter  them  straight.  The  following  things  are  required:  For 
making  fast  the  table  of  the  Altar,  four  nails,  and  as  many  more  are  required  for  the 
Table  of  Oblation;  four  stones,  wherewith  to  drive  the  nails;  one  altar-cloth  for 
draping  the  Altar,  and  another  for  the  Table  of  Oblation;  upper  altar-cloths,  for 
covering  the  Altar  and  the  Table  of  Oblation;  veils;  cloths  wherewith  to  wipe  the 
Altar;  a  curtain  for  the  Holy  Door;  two  palls,  for  the  Altar  and  the  Table  of  Obla- 
tion; one  glass  each  of  rose-water  and  of  church  wine;  holy  Chrism,  and  an  anoint- 
ing brush;  a  sponge  for  the  corporal;  a  sponge  for  the  sacred  chalice;  a  small  leaden 
box  for  the  holy  relics  under  the  Altar;  tapers  for  the  Bishop,  and  for  distribution 
among  the  other  Ecclesiastics  and  the  laity;  incense,  both  of  the  finest  sort,  and  also 
of  the  ordinary  sort;  two  large  tapers,  for  carrying  in  procession;  the  church  banners, 
if  there  be  any.     And  round'  about  the  Church  it  must  be  clean. 

Then  the  table-board  shall  be  taken  from  the  Altar,  and  placed  against  the  wall,  on  the 
right-hand  side,  and  note  must  be  taken  beforehand  of  the  position  in  which  it  lay 
upon  the  Altar  columns. 

Then  a  table  is  placed  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door,  and  upon  it  is  spread  an  altar-cloth: 
And  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  the  precious  cross,  and  the  sacred  vessels  are 
set  thereon;  the  spoon,  the  spear,  the  altar-cloths,  together  with  the  veils,  the  cord,  the 
covering  of  the  Altar  and  of  the  Table  of  Oblation,  the  nails,  and  the  sponges;  ana 
they  are  covered  with  an  altar-cloth;  and  four  candlesticks  are  set  there,  one  at  each 
corner;  and  another  small  table  is  placed  within  the  Sanctuary,  near  the  Bishop's 
throne,  and  an  altar-cloth  is  spread  thereon;  and  upon  this  table  are  placed  the  holy 
Chrism,  the  church-wine  and  the  rose-water  in  their  glasses,  an  anointing-brush,  an 
aspergillus,  the  stones  wherewith  the  nails  are  to  be  driven,  and  the  wax-mastic. 

And  the  holy  relics  are  placed  upon  the  paten,  covered  with  the  star-cover  and  the  veil, 
and  on  the  eve  of  the  Consecration  are  set  upon  a  lectern  before  the  holy  picture  of  the 
Saviour,  by  the  side  of  the  Holy  Door,  in  the  Church  itself;  and  outside  the  Sanctuary 

*  See  Appendix  B,  XIII. 


494         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

is  celebrated  the  Vigil  Office,  by  whomsoever  the  Bishop  shall  appoint.  And 
before  the  blessing  of  the  water,  the  relics  shall  be  borne  thence,  with  all  reverence,  to  a 
neighbouring  Church,  after  an  early  Liturgy,  and  there  placed  upon  the  holy  Altar; 
and  the  book  of  the  Gospels  shall  be  placed  from  the  east  over  the  holy  relics;  and  a 
candlestick  shall  be  placed  before  the  holy  relics.  But  if  there  be  no  other  church  in 
the  vicinity,  then  they  shall  stand  in  the  same  spot  until  they  are  used. 

THE  BEGINNING  OF  THE  CONSECRATION 

When  the  time  for  the  Divine  Liturgy  is  come,  and  the  Bishop  hath  entered  the 
Church  which  is  to  be  consecrated,  he  vesteth  himself  in  his  episcopal  robes, 
and  addeth  thereto  a  special  white  garment  (sratchitza) .  (2)  And  thus  arrayed  he 
entereth  the  holy  Sanctuary ;  and  the  Priests  who  are  to  serve,  wearing  similar 
garments  over  their  priestly  vestments,  bear  before  the  Bishop  the  table  with  all 
things  needful  for  the  Consecration,  and  set  it  on  the  right-hand  side.  And  the 
Bishop,  giving  his  pastoral  staff  to  a  Sub-Deacon  as  he  cometh  to  the  Holy  Doors, 
entereth  the  Sanctuary:  and  after  he  hath  prayed,  he  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  in 
blessing  over  those  who  are  serving,  on  both  sides.  At  this  time  the  Deacon  bringeth 
holy  waiter  (3)  to  the  Bishop,  and  the  Bishop,  taking  the  aspergillus,  sprinkleth  the 
columns  with  the  holy  water.  Then  the  Sacristan  bringeth  the  hot  wax-mastic  to 
the  Bishop,  and  the  Bishop  sprinkleth  the  wax-mastic  with  holy  water,  and  taketh 
the  vessel  with  the  wax-mastic,  and  poureth  it  upon  the  columns,  in  the  form  of  a 
cross,  to  the  requisite  amount,  compassing  them  about;  then  he  giveth  the  vessel  to  the 
Sacristan,  and  again  sprinkleth  the  columns  with  holy  water,  that  the  wax-mastic 
may  harden  quickly;  and  the  Priests  breathe  upon  the  columns  where  the  wax- 
mastic  is,  until  it  is  hard.  (4) 

And  when  this  is  finished,  the  Archdeacon  saith: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
The  Priests.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  the  Bishop  reciteth  this  Prayer,  in  the  hearing  of  all: 

0  Lord  God  our  Saviour,  who  createst  all  things  and  makest  the  race 
of  man  for  salvation,  accept  the  prayer  of  us,  thine  unworthy  servants; 
and  enable  us  at  this  present  hour  without  condemnation  to  accomplish 
the  consecration  of  this  Temple,  founded  to  thy  praise  in  the  name  of 
Saint  N.;  and  to  consummate  the  erection  therein  of  an  Altar. 

Exclamation.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship, 
to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages. Priests.  Amen. 

Then  the  Priests  bring  the  table  of  the  Altar,  and  the  Bishop  sprinkleth  it  on  all  sides, 
and  layeth  it  upon  the  columns  of  the  Altar. 

And  while  this  is  being  done,  the  following  Psalm  is  sung: 

Psalm  cxlv. 

1  will  magnify  thee,  O  God,  my  King;  and  I  will  praise  thy  Name 
forever  and  ever.  Every  day  will  I  give  thanks  unto  thee;  and  praise 
thy  Name  forever  and  ever.  Great  is  the  Lord,  and  marvellous  worthy 
to  be  praised ;  there  is  no  end  of  his  greatness.  One  generation  shall 
praise  thy  works  unto  another,  and  declare  thy  power.  As  for  me,  I  will 
be  talking  of  thy  worship,  thy  glory,  thy  praise,  and  wondrous  works;  so 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH         495 

that  men  shall  speak  of  the  might  of  thy  marvellous  acts;  and  I  will 
also  tell  of  thy  greatness.  The  memorial  of  thine  abundant  kindness 
shall  be  showed;  and  men  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  The  Lord  is 
gracious  and  merciful ;  long-suffering,  and  of  great  goodness.  The  Lord 
is  loving  unto  every  man ;  and  his  mercy  is  over  all  his  works.  All  thy 
works  praise  thee,  O  Lord ;  and  thy  saints  give  thanks  unto  thee.  They 
show  the  glory  of  thy  kingdom,  and  talk  of  thy  power;  that  thy  power, 
thy  glory,  and  mightiness  of  thy  kingdom,  might  be  known  unto  men. 
Thy  kingdom  is  an  everlasting  kingdom,  and  thy  dominion  endureth 
throughout  all  ages.  The  Lord  upholdeth  all  such  as  fall,  and  lifteth 
up  all  those  that  are  down.  The  eyes  of  all  wait  upon  thee,  O  Lord;  and 
thou  givest  them  their  meat  in  due  season.  Thou  openest  thine  hand, 
and  fillest  all  things  living  with  plenteousness.  The  Lord  is  righteous  in 
all  his  ways,  and  holy  in  all  his  works.  The  Lord  is  nigh  unto  all  them 
that  call  upon  him;  yea,  all  such  as  call  upon  him  faithfully.  He  will 
fulfil  the  desire  of  them  that  fear  him;  he  also  will  hear  their  cry,  and 
will  help  them.  The  Lord  preserveth  all  them  that  love  him;  but  scat- 
tereth  abroad  all  the  ungodly.  My  mouth  shall  speak  the  praise  of  the 
Lord ;  and  let  all  flesh  give  thanks  unto  his  holy  Name  forever  and  ever. 

And  when  the  Psalm  is  finished,  the  Bishop  saith: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.. 

The  Priests.  Amen. 

And  when  the  wax-mastic  hath  become  hard,  and  the  places  upon  which  it  flowed  have 
been  cleaned,  they  say  Psalm  xxiii. 

The  Lord  is  my  shepherd;  therefore  can  I  lack  nothing.  He  shall 
feed  me  in  a  green  pasture,  and  lead  me  forth  beside  the  waters  of  com- 
fort. He  shall  convert  my  soul,  and  bring  me  forth  in  the  paths  of 
righteousness  for  his  Name's  sake.  Yea,  though  I  walk  through  the 
valley  of  the  shadow  of  death,  I  will  fear  no  evil;  for  thou  art  with  me; 
thy  rod  and  thy  staff  comfort  me.  Thou  shalt  prepare  a  table  before 
me  against  them  that  trouble  me;  thou  hast  anointed  my  head  with  oil, 
and  my  cup  shall  be  full.  But  thy  loving-kindness  and  mercy  shall 
follow  me  all  the  days  of  my  life;  and  I  will  dwell  in  the  house  of  the 

Lord  forever. 

Then  the  Bishop: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Priests.  Amen. 

The  Sacristan  bringeth  four  nails,  and  layeth  them  on  the  Altar;  (5)  and  the  Bishop 
sprinkleth  them  with  holy  water  and  placeih  them  in  the  columns.  Again,  the 
Sacristan  bringeth  the  four  stones;  and  the  Bishop  having  taken  one  stone  and  the 
officiating  ecclesiastics  the  others,  they  make  firm  the  Altar.  And  when  the  Altar 
hath  been  established,  the  carpet  is  immediately  spread  before  the  Holy  Door,  and 
{the  Holy  Door  being  now  opened),  the  upper  end  is  laid  in  place.  And  when  the 
Bishop  is  come  forth  from  the  Sanctuary,  the  Deacon  shall  exclaim: 


496         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

Again,  yet  again,  on  bended  knees,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  Priests  within  the  Sanctuary  chant:  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.)  After 
which  the  Bishop,  kneeling,  saith  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God,  without  beginning  and  eternal,  who  callest  all  things  into 
being  from  nothingness;  who  dwellest  in  light  unapproachable,  and  hast 
the  heavens  for  thy  throne,  and  the  earth  for  thy  footstool;  who  didst 
give  a  law  and  pattern  unto  Moses,  and  didst  inspire  Bezaleel  with  the 
spirit  of  wisdom,  and  didst  enable  them  to  complete  the  perfect  building 
of  the  Tabernacle  of  thy  Covenant,  wherein  ordinances  of  divine  worship 
were  instituted,  which  were  the  images  and  types  of  the  true;  who  didst 
bestow  upon  Solomon  breadth  and  greatness  of  heart,  and  thereby 
didst  rear  of  old  the  Temple ;  and  upon  thy  holy  and  all-laudable  Apostles 
didst  renew  the  service  in  the  Spirit,  and  the  grace  of  the  true  Tabernacle, 
and  through  the  same,  O  Lord  of  Hosts,  didst  plant  thy  churches  and 
thine  altars  in  all  the  earth,  that  there  might  be  offered  unto  thee  con- 
secrated and  unbloody  sacrifices;  who,  also,  hast  graciously  been  pleased 
to  found  this  Temple,  in  the  name  of  Saint  N.,  to  thy  glory,  and  to  the 
glory  of  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  and  of  thine  all-holy  Spirit:  Do  thou, 
the  same  immortal  and  munificent  King,  call  to  mind  thy  bounties  and 
thy  mercies,  which  are  from  everlasting,  and  abhor  not  us  who  are  defiled 
with  a  multitude  of  sins,  neither  annul  thou  thy  Covenant  because  of 
our  uncleanness;  but  disregard  thou  now  our  iniquities,  and  strengthen 
us  with  the  grace  and  inspiration  of  thy  life-giving  and  holy  Spirit,  that 
without  condemnation  we  may  accomplish  the  renewal  of  this  Temple, 
and  fulfil  the  consecration  of  the  Altar(s)  therein;  that  therein  blessing 
thee  in  Psalms,  and  songs,  and  mystical  rites  we  may  always  magnify 
thy  loving-kindness.  Yea,  O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  the  hope  of  all  the 
ends  of  the  earth,  hear  us  sinners  who  make  our  supplications  unto  thee, 
and  send  down  thine  all-holy,  and  adorable,  and  almighty  Spirit,  and 
sanctify  this  Temple  and  this  Altar  (these  Altars):  Fill  it  (them)  with  the 
light  everlasting:  elect  it  (them)  for  thy  dwelling-place;  make  it  (them) 
the  abode  of  thy  glory.  Adorn  it  (them)  with  thy  divine  and  supernal 
gifts.  Appoint  it  (them)  for  a  haven  of  the  tempest-tossed,  for  a  healing 
of  passions,  for  a  refuge  of  the  weak,  for  an  expelling  of  evil  spirits.  Let 
thine  eyes  be  open  upon  it  (them)  day  and  night,  and  let  thine  ears  be 
heedful  of  the  prayer  of  those  who  shall  enter  therein  in  thy  fear  and  in 
devoutness,  and  shall  call  upon  thine  all-honourable  and  adorable  Name ; 
that  whatsoever  they  shall  ask  of  thee,  thou  wilt  hear  it  in  heaven  above, 
and  wilt  show  mercy  and  be  gracious  unto  them.  Preserve  it  indestructi- 
ble even  unto  the  end  of  the  ages,  and  show  forth  the  holy  Altar(^)  therein, 
the  Altar(s)  of  thy  Holy  Things  through  the  power  and  effectual  opera- 
tion of  thy  Holy  Spirit.  Glorify  it  (them)  above  the  Mercy-Seat  accord- 
ing to  the  Law;  that  the  holy  offices  which  shall  be  celebrated  thereon 
may  attain  unto  thy  holy,  and  most  heavenly,  and  supersensual  Altar,

and  obtain  for  us  the  grace  of  thy  most  pure  over-shadowing;  for  we 
trust  not  in  the  service  of  our  unworthy  hands,  but  in  thine  unspeakable 
goodness. 

And  when  the  Prayer  is  finished,  the  Bishop  standeth,  and  goeth  into  the  Sanctuary, 
to  the  holy  Altar;  and  the  Proto-Deacon,  within  the  holy  Sanctuary,  saith  (the  Holy 
Door  being  closed) : 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

The  Priests.  Lord,  have  mercy.

Exclamation.

The  Priests.  Amen. 

Then  a  porringer  is  brought,  filled  with  warm  water,  and  red  wine  and  rose-water. 
And  the  Proto-Deacon  saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop,  bowing  his  head,  saith  this  Prayer  over  the  water  and  the  wine: 
O  Lord  our  God,  who  didst  sanctify  the  streams  of  Jordan  by  thy 
redeeming  manifestation:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  send  down  now  also 


498         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

the  grace  of  thy  Holy  Spirit;  and  bless  this  water  and  this  wine,  unto 
the  sanctifi cation  and  completion  of  this  thine  Altar  {these  thy  Altars): 
For  blessed  art  thou  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer,  he  poureth  the  warm  water,  thrice,  upon  the  Altar,  saying: 
In  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen. 

And  mingling  the  red  wine  and  the  rose-water,  he  poureth  them  into  one  vessel. 

Then  the  Sacristan  bringeth  four  cloths.  And  the  Bishop,  taking  one  of  them,  blesseth 
his  fellow-ministers  to  take  the  others;  and  they  wipe  the  Altar  therewith. 

And  when  these  things  are  finished,  Psalm  lxxxiv.  is  said. 

O  how  amiable  are  thy  dwellings,  thou  Lord  of  Hosts!  My  soul  hath 
a  desire  and  longing  to  enter  into  the  courts  of  the  Lord ;  my  heart  and 
my  flesh  rejoice  in  the  living  God.  Yea,  the  sparrow  hath  found  her  an 
house,  and  the  swallow  a  nest,  where  she  may  lay  her  young;  even  thy 
altars,  O  Lord  of  Hosts,  my  King  and  my  God.  Blessed  are  they  that 
dwell  in  thy  house;  they  will  be  alway  praising  thee.  Blessed  is  the 
man  whose  strength  is  in  thee ;  in  whose  heart  are  thy  ways.  Who  going 
through  the  vale  of  misery  use  it  for  a  well ;  and  the  pools  are  filled  with 
water.  They  will  go  from  strength  to  strength,  and  unto  the  God  of 
gods  appeareth  every  one  of  them  in  Zion.  O  Lord  God  of  Hosts,  hear 
my  prayer;  hearken,  O  God  of  Jacob.  Behold,  O  God  our  defender, 
and  look  upon  the  face  of  thine  Anointed.  For  one  day  in  thy  courts 
is  better  than  a  thousand.  I  had  rather  be  a  door-keeper  in  the  house 
of  my  God,  than  to  dwell  in  the  tents  of  ungodliness.  For  the  Lord  God 
is  a  light  and  defence ;  the  Lord  will  give  grace  and  worship ;  and  no  good 
thing  shall  he  withhold  from  them  that  live  a  godly  life.  O  Lord  God 
of  Hosts,  blessed  is  the  man  that  putteth  his  trust  in  thee. 

And  when  the  Altar  hath  been  washed  and  wiped,  the  Bishop  saith: 
Glory  to  our  God  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Priests.  Amen. 

The  Bishop  then  taketh  from  the  Sacristan  the  red  wine  mingled  with  rose-water,  and 
poureth  it  upon  the  Altar,  thrice,  in  cross-form,  liberally,  and  they  wet  the  Altar 
abundantly,  stretching  forth  their  hands:  and  with  this  same  mixture  the  Bishop 
sprinkleth  the  other  holy  corporals.  (6)  And  as  he  doth  this,  he  saith  at  each 
sprinkling: 

Thou  shalt  sprinkle  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be  clean:  thou  shalt 
wash  me,  and  I  shall  be  whiter  than  snow. 

And  after  the  Altar  and  the  corporals  have  been  sprinkled,  the  following  shall  be 
added  (Psalm  li.  verses  8-19): 

Thou  shalt  make  me  hear  of  joy  and  gladness,  that  the  bones  which 
thou  hast  broken  may  rejoice.  Turn  thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  put 
out  all  my  misdeeds.     Make  me  a  clean  heart,  O  God,  and  renew  a  right 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH         499 

spirit  within  me.  Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  presence,  and  take  not 
thy  holy  Spirit  from  me.  O  give  me  the  comfort  of  thy  help  again,  and 
stablish  me  with  thy  free  Spirit.  Then  shall  I  teach  thy  ways  unto  the 
wicked,  and  sinners  shall  be  converted  unto  thee.  Deliver  me  from 
blood-guiltiness,  O  God,  thou  that  art  the  God  of  my  health;  and  my 
tongue  shall  sing  of  thy  righteousness.  Thou  shalt  open  my  lips*  O  Lord, 
and  my  mouth  shall  show  thy  praise.  For  thou  desirest  no  sacrifice, 
else  would  I  give  it  thee;  but  thou  delightest  not  in  burnt-offerings.  The 
sacrifice  of  God  is  a  troubled  spirit:  a  broken  and  contrite  heart,  O  God, 
shalt  thou  not  despise.  O  be  favourable  and  gracious  unto  Zion;  build 
thou  the  walls  of  Jerusalem.  Then  shalt  thou  be  pleased  with  the  sacri- 
fice of  righteousness,  with  the  burnt-offerings  and  oblations;  then  shall 
they  offer  young  bullocks  upon  thine  altar. 

Then  the  Sacristan  bringeth  the  sponges.  The  Bishop  taketh  one  sponge,  and  his 
fellow-ministers  take  the  others;  and  they  wipe  the  Altar  with  the  sponges.  Then 
they  spread  the  corporal  (or  the  corporals)  at  the  upper  edge  of  the  Altar.  Then  the 
Bishop  saith: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Priests.  Amen. 

Then  the  Sacristan  bringeth  the  holy  Chrism.  The  Bishop,  taking  the  brush,  anoint- 
eth  the  Altar,  in  cross-form.  The  Proto-Deacon  saith,  for  the  Altar,  and  for  each 
corporal:  Let  us  attend.  The  Bishop  maketh  upon  the  Altar  three  crosses,  one  in 
the  middle,  and  one  on  each  side,  a  little  lower  down,  saying:  Alleluia,  thrice,  at 
each.  And  he  anointeth  also  the  pillars  of  the  Altar,  on  two  sides,  and  on  the  mid- 
dle, and  on  the  edges.  Thereafter  the  Priests  take  the  corporal  (corporals)  and  lay 
it  (them)  on  the  Altar,  one  by  one,  below  the  crosses,  which  are  traced  with  the  holy 
Chrism,  that  these  crosses  be  not  erased.  The  Bishop  maketh  three  crosses  on  each 
corporal  (antimins)  (7)  with  the  holy  Chrism,  which  is  on  the  Altar.  And  when 
this  is  accomplished,  Psalm  cxxxiii.  is  read: 

Behold,  how  good  and  joyful  a  thing  it  is,  brethren,  to  dwell  together 
in  unity!  It  is  like  the  precious  ointment  upon  the  head,  that  ran  down 
unto  the  beard,  even  unto  Aaron's  beard,  and  went  down  to  the  skirts 
of  his  clothing.  Like  as  the  dew  of  Hermon,  which  fell  upon  the  hill  of 
Zion.     For  there  the  Lord  promised  his  blessing,  and  life  forevermore. 

Then  the  Bishop  saith: 
Glory  to  thee,  O  Holy  Trinity  our  God,  unto  ages'  of  ages. 
The  Priests.  Amen. 

And  they  place  the  corporal  (or  the  corporals)  on  the  salver.  Then  the  Priests  bring 
the  first  covering  of  the  Altar;  (8)  the  Bishop  sprinkleth  it  without  and  within  with 
holy  water,  and  they  put  it  on  the  Altar.  Then  the  cord  is  brought.  (9)  The 
Bishop  sprinkleth  the  cord,  and  they  bind  the  Altar  about  therewith;  and  this  is  the 
manner  of  the  binding.  The  Bishop  holdeth  the  cord  upon  the  right  side,  at  the 
first  pillar,  and  they  all  go  with  the  cord  round  to  the  second  pillar  towards  the  east, 
whence  it  is  carried  to  the  bottom  of  the  third  pillar,  and  goeth  to  the  bottom  of  the 
fourth  pillar,  and  is  carried  again  to  the  middle  of  the  first  pillar,  and  fastened  to 


500         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

the  end  which  the  Bishop  holdeth;  and  again  it  is  carried  to  the  bottom  of  the  second 
pillar,  and  passeth,  low  down,  to  the  third  pillar,  and  is  taken  thence  to  the  top  of  the 
fourth  pillar,  and  from  the  fourth  pillar  is  carried  to  the  bottom  of  the  first  pillar,  so 
that  a  cross  is  formed  at  the  front.  And  from  the  first  pillar  it  goeth  io  the  bottom  of 
the  second  pillar,  and  thence  is  carried  to  the  top  of  the  third  pillar,  so  that  a  cro.s  s  is 
formed  towards  the  east.  And  from  the  third  pillar  it  is  carried  to  the  bottom  of  the 
fourth  pillar,  so  that  there  is  a  cross  upon  the  north  side;  and  from  the  fourth  pillar 
it  goeth  to  the  bottom  of  the  first  pillar.  And  from  the  bottom  of  the  first  pillar  it 
goeth  to  the  top  of  the  second  pillar;  and  so  there  is  formed  a  cross  on  the  south  side. 
And  it  passeth  round  in  such  manner  that  there  are  three  cords  at  the  top,  and  the 
second  end  of  the  rope  is  bound  to  the  first  end  at  the  first  pillar. 

And  when  these  things  are  accomplished,  that  is  to  say,  when  the  Altar  hath  been 
robed  in  the  first  covering  and  bound  about  with  the  cord,  Psalm  cxxxii.  is  said, 
once,  twice,  and  thrice. 

Lord,  remember  David,  and  all  his  trouble:  how  he  sware  unto  the 
Lord,  and  vowed  a  vow  unto  the  Almighty  God  of  Jacob;  I  will  not 
come  within  the  tabernacle  of  mine  house,  nor  climb  up  into  my  bed; 
I  will  not  suffer  mine  eyes  to  sleep,  nor  mine  eyelids  to  slumber;  neither 
the  temples  of  my  head  to  take  any  rest;  until  I  find  out  a  place  for  the 
temple  of  the  Lord;  an  habitation  for  the  mighty  God  of  Jacob.  Lo, 
we  heard  of  the  same  at  Ephrata,  and  found  it  in  the  wood.  We  will 
go  into  his  tabernacle,  and  fall  low  on  our  knees  before  his  footstool. 
Arise,  O  Lord,  into  thy  resting-place;  thou,  and  the  ark  of  thy  strength. 
Let  thy  priests  be  clothed  with  righteousness;  and  let  thy  saints  sing 
with  joyfulness.  For  thy  servant  David's  sake,  turn  not  away  the 
presence  of  thine  Anointed.  The  Lord  hath  made  a  faithful  oath  unto 
David,  and  he  shall  not  shrink  from  it;  of  the  fruit  of  thy  body  shall  I 
set  upon  thy  seat.  If  thy  children  will  keep  my  covenant,  and  my  tes- 
timonies that  I  shall  learn  them;  their  children  also  shall  sit  upon  thy 
seat  forevermore.  For  the  Lord  hath  chosen  Zion  to  be  an  habitation 
for  himself;  he  hath  longed  for  her.  This  shall  be  my  rest  forever:  here 
will  I  dwell,  for  I  have  a  delight  therein.  I  will  bless  her  victuals  with 
increase,  and  will  satisfy  her  poor  with  bread.  I  will  deck  her  priests 
with  health,  and  her  saints  shall  rejoice  and  sing.  There  shall  I  make 
the  horn  of  David  to  flourish :  I  have  ordained  a  lantern  for  mine  Anointed. 
As  for  his  enemies,  I  shall  clothe  them  with  shame;  but  upon  himself 
shall  his  crown  flourish. 

And  when  this  is  finished,  the  Bishop  saith: 
Glory  to  our  God  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Then  the  Priests  bring  the  upper  covering  (the  inditia).  (io)  The  Bishop  sprinkleth 
it  with  holy  water  within  and  without,  and  they  put  it  on  the  holy  Altar,  and  spread 
the  pall  {the  iliton),  (n)  and  upon  it  place  the  corporal  (corporals),  and  the  book 
of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and  the  precious  cross  upon  the  Altar,  and  cover  them  with  the 
altar-cloth;  and  all  these  things  are  sprinkled  with  holy  water.  And  all  these  things 
being  accomplished,  Psalm  xciii.  is  read: 

The  Lord  is  King,  and  hath  put  on  glorious  apparel;  the  Lord  hath 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH         501 

put  on  his  apparel,  and  girded  himself  with  strength.  He  hath  made 
the  round  world  so  sure,  that  it  cannot  be  moved.  Ever  since  the  world 
began  hath  thy  seat  been  prepared:  thou  art  from  everlasting.  The 
floods  are  risen,  O  Lord,  the  floods  have  lift  up  their  voice;  the  floods 
lift  up  their  waves.  The  waves  of  the  sea  are  mighty,  and  rage  horribly; 
but  yet  the  Lord,  who  dwelleth  on  high,  is  mightier.     Thy  testimonies, 

0  Lord,  are  very  sure:  holiness  becometh  thine  house  forever. 

And  after  the  Psalm  the  Bishop  saith: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
The  Priests.  Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  commandeth  the  chief  of  the  officiating  clergy  to  array  the  Table  of 
Oblation,  with  sprinkling  of  holy  water;  and  they  place  the  vessels',  and  the  veils 
thereon,  and  cover  them  with  an  altar-cloth,  saying  nothing,  but  only  sprinkling 
them  with  holy  water.  Then  the  Bishop  is  divested  of  the  special  white  garment; 
and  the  Proto-Deacon  bringeth  the  censer  to  the  Bishop.  And  the  Bishop  censeth 
the  Altar  and  the  Table  of  Oblation  round  about,  and  all  the  Sanctuary;  and  the 
Proto-Deacon  goeth  before  him  with  a  taper,  reciting  Psalm  xxvi.  : 

Be  thou  my  Judge,  O  Lord,  for  I  have  walked  innocently:  my  trust 
hath  been  also  in  the  Lord,  therefore  shall  I  not  fall.  Examine  me,  O 
Lord,  and  prove  me;  try  out  my  reins  and  my  heart.  For  thy  loving- 
kindness  is  ever  before  mine  eyes;  and  I  will  walk  in  thy  truth.  I  have 
not  dwelt  with  vain  persons;  neither  will  I  have  fellowship  with  the 
deceitful.  I  have  hated  the  congregation  of  the  wicked;  and  will  not 
sit  among  the  ungodly.  I  will  wash  my  hands  in  innocency,  O  Lord; 
and  so  will  I  go  to  thine  altar;  that  I  may  show  the  voice  of  thanksgiving; 
and  tell  of  all  thy  wondrous  works.  Lord,  I  have  loved  the  habitation 
of  thy  house,  and  the  place  where  thine  honour  dwelleth.  O  shut  not 
up  my  soul  with  the  sinners,  nor  my  life  with  the  blood-thirsty;  in  whose 
hands  is  wickedness,  and  their  right  hand  is  full  of  gifts.     But  as  for  me, 

1  will  walk  innocently:  O  deliver  me,  and  be  merciful  unto  me.  My 
foot  standeth  right:  I  will  praise  the  Lord  in  the  congregations, 

many  times,  until  the  Sanctuary  and  the  whole  Church  have  been  censed. 

And  as  the  Bishop  censeth,  two  Archimandrites,  or  Abbots,  or  Priests,  follow  him. 
One  sprinkleth  the  walls  with  holy  water;  the  second,  holding  the  vessel  of  the  holy 
Chrism,  anointeth  them  with  the  brush,  in  cross-form,  dipping  it  in  the  Chrism, 
first  in  the  Sanctuary  over  the  Bishop's  seat,  above  the  window;  then  over  the  western 
doors  of  the  church;  then  on  the  south  side  and  the  north  side  over  the  doors;  and  if 
they  be  lofty,  steps  are  used. 

And  when  the  censing  and  the  Psalm  are  finished,  the  Bishop  enter eth  the  Sanctuary 
and  saith: 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


502         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

And  the  Proto-Deacon  taketh  the  censer  and  censeth  the  Bishop  thrice.  Then  he 
saith,  in  front  of  the  Altar,  on  the  left  side,  the  Little  Litany. 

Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  keep  us,  O  God,  by  thy 
grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undefiled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop  doth  not  make  the  Exclamation,  but  the  Proto-Deacon: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Then  the  Bishop's  mitre  is  removed.  And  standing  in  front  of  the  holy  Altar,  he 
saith,  very  loudly,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord  of  heaven  and  earth,  who  with  wisdom  ineffable  hast  founded 
thy  holy  Church,  and  hast  appointed  the  Order  of  the  Priesthood  upon 
the  earth  for  an  antitype  of  the  Angels'  service  in  heaven :  Do  thou,  O  mu- 
nificent Lord,  receive  also  us  who  now  make  our  petitions  unto  thee,  not 
as  being  worthy  to  ask  such  great  things  of  thee,  but  that  the  exceeding 
excellence  of  thy  goodness  may  be  manifested;  for  thou  hast  not  ceased 
in  manifold  wise  to  be  gracious  unto  mankind.  And,  as  the  chief  est  of 
thy  benefits,  thou  hast  bestowed  upon  us  the  coming  in  the  flesh  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  who  was  seen  upon  earth,  and  shedding  forth  the  light 
of  salvation  upon  them  that  sat  in  darkness,  did  offer  himself  a  sacrifice 
for  us,  and  became  a  propitiation  for  the  whole  world,  making  us  to  be 
partakers  of  his  Resurrection;  and  after  that  he  had  ascended  into  heaven, 
he  endued  his  Apostles  and  Disciples,  as  he  had  promised,  with  power  from 
on  high,  which  is  the  Holy  Spirit,  adored  and  almighty,  who  proceedeth 
from  thee,  our  God  and  Father;  through  whom,  also,  they  became 
mighty  in  deed  and  in  word,  administered  Baptism  unto  the  adoption  of 
sonship,  builded  churches,  established  Altars,  and  instituted  the  laws  and 
precepts  of  the  Priesthood.  And  we  sinners,  having  preserved  the  tra- 
dition thereof,  do  fall  down  before  thee,  the  everlasting  God,  and  implore 
thee,  O  Loving-kind  One:  Fill  with  thy  glory  divine  this  Temple  erected 
to  thy  praise,  and  show  thou  forth  the  holy  Altar(s)  therein  set  up  as  the 
Holy  of  Holies;  that  we  who  stand  before  it  {them),  as  before  the  dread 
throne  of  thy  kingdom,  may  serve  thee  uncondemned,  sending  up  unto 
thee  petitions  for  ourselves  and  for  all  the  people,  and  offering  the  un- 
bloody sacrifice  to  thy  goodness,  unto  the  remission  of  sins  both  volun- 
tary and  involuntary,  unto  the  governing  of  our  life,  the  attainment  of  a 
good  conversation,  and  the  fulfilling  of  all  righteousness.

For  blessed  be  thine  all-holy  Name,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Priests.  Amen. 

And  the  Bishop  saith: 

Peace  be  with  you  all. Priests.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Proto-Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop  saith,  secretly,  the  following  Prayer: 

We  thank  thee,  O  Lord  God  of  Hosts,  for  that  thou  hast  gra- 
ciously vouchsafed  to  continue  also  even  unto  us  sinners  and  thine 
unworthy  servants,  because  of  thy  great  love  toward  mankind,  that 
grace  which  thou  hast  poured  out  upon  thy  holy  Apostles,  and  upon 
our  sainted  fathers.  Wherefore  we  pray  thee,  O  all-merciful  Lord: 
Fill  with  glory,  and  holiness,  and  grace  this  Altar  {these  Altars),  that 
the  unbloody  sacrifices  which  shall  thereon  be  offered  unto  thee  may 
be  transmuted  into  the  most  pure  Body  and  precious  Blood  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  who  is  our  Lord,  and  God,  and  Saviour  Jesus 
Christ,  unto  the  salvation  of  all  thy  people,  and  of  our  unworthiness. 

Exclamation.  For  thou  art  our  God,  the  God  whose  property  it  is  to 
show  mercy  and  to  save;  and  unto  thee  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Priests.  Amen. 

And  thereupon  there  is  brought  to  the  Bishop  a  candlestick,  and  therein  a  new,  un- 
lighted  taper,  which  the  Bishop  lighteth  with  his  own  hands,  (12)  and  placeth  on  the 
High  Place  (the  Bishop's  seat)  behind  the  Altar* 

Then  the  Sacristan  directeth  how  they  are,  to  go  to  another  church,  with  the  cross,  for 
the  holy  relics:  the  Bishop  giveth  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  and  the  cross  to  the 
Priests,  and  distributed  the  tapers  in  the  Sanctuary  to  those  present,  and  issuing 
forth  from  the  Sanctuary  upon  the  tribune,  to  the  laity.  Then  the  Bishop  entereth 
the  Sanctuary:  and  preceded  by  the  priests,  the  Bishop  goeth  forth  from  the  Sanctu- 
ary through  the  church  doors  for  the  holy  relics,  taking  his  pastoral  staff  at  the  Holy 
Door  from  a  Chanter,  and  saith: 

Let  us  go  forth  in  peace. 

Then  they  go  for  the  holy  relics,  according  to  the  ritual:  in  front  are  borne  the  church 
banners,  and  the  holy  pictures  (ikoni),  as  is  done  in  processions  of  the  cross.  _  The 
Bishop  is  supported  by  two  Deacons.  And  the  Priests  walk  before  the  Bishop, 
bearing  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  and  the  cross,  and  the  Proto-Deacon  and  the 
Deacon  cense. 

The  Singers  chant  the  Hymn,  in  Tone  IV 

Thy  Church  which,  in  all  the  world,  thou  hast  adorned  with  the  blood 
of  thy  martyrs,  as  it  were  purple  and  fine  linen,  crieth  aloud  through 
them  unto  thee,  O  Christ-God:  Send  down  thy  bounties  uoon  thy  people, 
giving  grace  unto  thine  Estate,  and  great  mercy  unto  our  souls. 

*  Note  that  up  to  this  point  no  tapers  have  been  lighted  in  the  Sanctuary. 


504         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

Glory  to  the  Father,  now,  .  .  .  (Tone  VIII.) 

The  universe  offereth  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  the  God-bearing  martyrs, 
the  first-fruits  of  nature,  as  to  the  Founder  of  Creation:  Through  the 
prayers  of  the  same,  and  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  O  merciful  One,  pre- 
serve in  peace  profound  thy  Church,  which  is  thine  Estate. 

And  when  the  Bishop  cometh  to  the  Temple  where  the  holy  relics  are  placed,  he  entereth 
the  Sanctuary  through  the  Holy  Door,  with  two  of  the  Ecclesiastics  there  present. 
And  at  the  Holy  Door  he  giveth  his  pastoral  staff  to  an  acolyte.  And  the  Bishop 
and  Ecclesiastics  do  reverence  to  the  holy  relics;  and  the  Bishop  maketh  the  sign  of 
the  cross  over  those  who  stand  there. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon,  standing  in  front  of  the  Holy  Door,  reciteth  the  Little  Litany. 
(See  page  502.) 

Again,  yet  again,  in  peace 

And  the  Priests  outside  the  Sanctuary  respond: 

Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  after  the  Litany,  the  Bishop  pronounceth  the  Exclamation  in  front  of  the  Altar: 

For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  who  restest  on  the  honourable  Martyrs, 
which  have  suffered  for  thee;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Proto-Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy 

And  the  Bishop  is  divested  of  his  mitre,  which  is  laid  upon  the  salver.  And  he  saith 
the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  faithful  in  thy  words,  and  steadfast  in  thy  promises, 
who  hast  enabled  thy  holy  Martyrs  to  fight  the  good  fight  and  to  fulfil 
the  course  of  godliness,  and  to  keep  the  faith  of  the  true  confession :  Be 
thou,  the  same  all-holy  Lord,  entreated  of  their  prayers,  and  vouchsafe 
unto  us  thine  unworthy  servants  to  have  a  part  and  inheritance  with 
them;  that  being  followers  of  them,  we  also  may  obtain  the  good  things 
which  await  them. 

Exclamation.  Through  the  mercy  and  love  toward  mankind  of  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  with  whom  thou  art  blessed,  together  with  thine  all- 
holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir    Amen. 

Bishop.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Proto-Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord.

THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH         505 

And  the  Bishop  saith,  secretly,  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Lord  our  God,  through  the  prayers  of  our  most  holy  Lady, 
the  Birth-giver  of  God,  and  of  all  thy  Saints,  direct  thou  the  works 
of  the  hands  of  us,  thine  unworthy  servants;  and  vouchsafe  that 
we  may,  in  all  things,  prove  acceptable  unto  thy  goodness. 

Exclamation.  Blessed  and  all-glorified  be  the  majesty  of  thy  kingdom, 
of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

The  Bishop  then  taketh  the  censer  from  the  Proto-Deacon,  and  censeth  the  holy  relics 
thrice  three  times;  and  giving  the  censer  to  be  held,  and  taking  the  holy  paten  with 
the  holy  relics,  covered  with  a  veil  over  the  star-cover,  he  setteth  it  upon  his  head,  and 
goeth  out  through  the  Holy  Door,  supported  by  the  chief  Ecclesiastics.  But  the 
Bishop  himself  holdeth  the  paten  with  both  hands.  And  thus  they  go  forth,  accord- 
ing to  their  rank.  In  front  are  borne  the  church  banners,  and  the  holy  image  (ikona) 
of  the  Temple.  Before  the  holy  image  go  the  Singers;  then  the  Priests,  then  the 
Taper-bearer  with  the  pastoral  staff;  and  the  mitre  is  borne  in  the  middle. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon  and  a  Deacon  go  with  censers  and  cense  the  holy  relics  and 
the  Bishop;  and  over  the  paten  Deacons  bear  two  or  four  sacramental  fans.  Before 
the  Bishop  Sub-Deacons  bear  the  double-branched  and  triple-branched  candlesticks 
(dikiri  and  trikiri). 

Then  the  Singers  chant  the  Hymn,  in  Tone  III.: 
O  Good  One,  who  didst  found  thy  Church  upon  the  rock  of  faith, 
direct  thou  aright  our  petitions  therein ;  and  accept  thou  the  people  who, 
in  faith,  do  cry  unto  thee:  Save  us,  O  our  God,  save  us. 

If  there  be  time,  they  sing  also  the  following  Theme-Songs  (Irmosi) : 
Tone  III.,  Song  III. 
O  Lord,  the  Confirmation  of  those  who  set  their  hope  on  thee,  confirm 
thou  thy  Church,  which  thou  hast  bought  with  thy  precious  blood. 

Tone  VI II.,  Song  III. 
O  Master  and  Creator  of  the  vault  of  heaven,  and  Founder  of  the 
Church,  establish  thou  me  in  thy  love,  O  thou  who  alone  lovest  mankind; 
the  Summit  of  desire,  the  Confirmation  of  the  faithful. 

Tone  V.,  Song  III. 
Thou  who  upon  nothing,  by  thy  command,  didst  erect  the  earth,  and 
didst  suspend  it,  hanging  unsupported :  Upon  the  rock  immovable  of  thy 
commandments,  O  Christ,  establish  thou  thy  Church,  O  thou  who  alone 
art  good  and  lovest  mankind. 

When  they  come  to  the  Church  which  is  to  be  consecrated,  they  circle  round  about  it 
from  the  western  door  to  the  southern  side,  and  so  on  to  the  east;  (13)  And  a  Priest 
goeth  before,  and  sprinkleth  the  Church  with  holy  water.  And  when  they  come  in 
front  of  the  great  door  of  the  Church,  the  Singers  chant  the  Hymns,  in  Tone  VII. : 

O  holy  Martyrs,  who  fought  the  good  fight  and  have  received  your 

crowns:  Entreat  ye  the  Lord  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 


506         THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH 

Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  the  Apostles'  boast,  the  Martyrs'  joy, 
whose  preaching  was  the  consubstantial  Trinity. 

Then  the  Bishop  taketh  from  his  head  the  paten  with  the  holy  relics,  and  setteth  it  on 
the  table  prepared  in  front  of  the  church  doors.  And  he  doeth  reverence  to  the  holy 
relics  thrice:  and  puttelh  on  his  mitre,  and  signeth  the  Priests  on  either  side  with 
the  sign  of  the  cross.  And  while  the  Singers  chant  the  Hymns,  they  enter  the 
Temple. 

And  the  doors  being  shut  or  screened  with  a  curtain,  the  Clergy  stand  with  the  holy 
images,  the  Gospels  and  the  cross,  behind  the  table  which  is  in  front  of  the  door, 
turning  toward  the  west;  and  on  the  table  is  spread  an  altar-cloth,  and  at  the  corners 
stand  four  candlesticks,  or  two;  and  the  Deacons  hold  the  sacramental  fans  over  the 
holy  relics. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon  bringeth  the  censer  to  the  Bishop.  And  the  Bishop,  taking  it, 
censeth  the  holy  paten  thrice  three  times,  as  also  the  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels,  and 
the  cross,  and  the  holy  images  (ikoni),  on  the  right  and  on  the  left;  and  also  the 
Clergy. 

And  after  the  censing,  the  Proto-Deacon  taketh  the  censer  from  the  Bishop,  and  censeth 
the  Bishop  thrice. 

And  the  Bishop,  standing  before  the  holy  relics,  saith: 
Blessed  art  thou  always,  O  Christ  our  God,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

And  the  Singers  within  the  Temple  respond:  Amen. 
Then  the  Bishop  saith: 
Receive  your  princes,  O  ye  gates,  and  be  ye  lifted  up,  ye  everlasting 
doors,  and  the  King  of  Glory  shall  come  in. 

And  the  Singers  within  the  Temple  sing: 
Who  is  this  King  of  Glory  ? 

And  again,  for  the  second  time,  the  Bishop  proclaimeih: 
Receive  your  princes,  O  ye  gates,  and  be  ye  lifted  up,  ye  everlasting 
doors,  and  the  King  of  Glory  shall  come  in. 
Singers.  Who  is  this  King  of  Glory? 
Proto-Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Singers.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Bishop's  mitre  is  then  removed,  and  he  saith,  in  a  loud  voice,  this  Prayer: 
Blessed  be  thou  forever,  O  God  and  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
who  through  the  veil  of  his  flesh  hath  consecrated  for  us  an  entrance  into, 
the  Church  of  the  first-born,  who  are  written  in  heaven,  where  is  the 
abode  of  those  who  rejoice,  and  the  voice  of  gladness:  Do  thou,  the  same 
Lord  who  lovest  mankind,  look  upon  us,  thy  sinful  and  unworthy 
servants,  who  now  celebrate  the  renewal  of  the  honourable  Temple  of  N., 
after  the  pattern  of  thy  most  holy  Church,  that  is,  of  our  own  body, 
which  thou  hast  vouchsafed  unto  us  by  thine  all-laudable  Apostle  Paul 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH  507 

to  call  thy  Temple  (and  members  of  thy  Christ);  and  establish  thou  it 
immovable  unto  the  end  of  time,  and  glorified  in  thee.  And  vouchsafe 
that  without  condemnation  we  may  offer  therein  praises  and  exaltations 
unto  thy  glory,  and  unto  thine  Only-begotten  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ, 
and  thy  Holy  Spirit,  with  understanding,  and  with  all  emotion ;  and  that 
those  who  worship  thee  in  thy  fear  may  show  themselves  worthy  of  thy 
divine  bounties;  and  that  these  prayers  offered  up  by  us  and  by  all  thy 
people  unto  thine  ineffable  loving-kindness  may  be  acceptable  unto  thy 
goodness:  Through  the  prayers  of  our  most  holy  Lady,  the  Birth-giver 
of  God,  and  ever-virgin  Mary. 

Exclamation. 

For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  who  restest  on  the  Saints.  And  unto 
thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Bishop.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Prolo-Deacon.  Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop  reciteth,  secretly,  this  Prayer  of  the  Entrance. 
O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  appointed  in  heaven,  ranks 
and  hosts  of  Angels  and  Archangels  for  the  ministry  of  thy  glory: 
Cause  that  with  our  entrance  may  enter  also  the  holy  Angels,  with 
us  serving  thee  and  with  us  glorifying  thy  goodness. 

Exclamation. 
For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and 
to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  taketk  the  paten  with  the  holy  relics,  and  signeth  the  doors  of  the 
Church  in  cross-form,  saying: 

The  Lord  of  Hosts,  he  is  the  King  of  Glory. 

And  the  Choir  singeth: 
The  Lord  of  Hosts,  he  is  the  King  of  Glory. 

And  while  the  Choir  singeth  this  for  the  last  time,  the  table  is  removed,  and  the  Bishop 
setteth  the  paten  with  the  holy  relics  on  his  head;  and  they  enter  the  Temple.  At 
that  moment  the  Choir  singeth  the  Hymn  in  Tone  IV 

Forasmuch  as  thou  hast  shown  forth  the  splendour  of  the  firmament  on 
high,  and  the  beauty  of  the  holy  habitation  of  thy  glory  here  below,  O 
Lord :  Establish  thou  the  same  forever,  and  accept  our  petitions  continu- 
ally offered  unto  thee  therein;  through  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  O  thou 
who  art  the  life  and  the  Resurrection  of  all  men.

And  the  Bishop  goeth  into  the  holy  Sanctuary,  through  the  Holy  Door,  and  setteth  the 
paten  with  the  holy  relics  on  the  holy  Altar,  and  doeth  reverence  to  the  holy  relics. 
And  the  Bishop's  mitre  is  put  upon  him.  Then  the  Proto-Deacon  bringeth  the 
censer  to  the  Bishop,  and  the  Bishop  taketh  it,  and  censeth  the  holy  relics  thrice 
three  times,  and  his  fellow-clergy,  on  both  sides.  And  the  Proto-Deacon,  taking 
the  censer  from  the  Bishop,  censeth  the  Bishop  thrice. 

The  Bishop  prayeth,  and  blesseth  his  fellow-ministers,  and  taketh  the  veil  and  star- 
cover  from  the  paten;  and  the  Sacristan  bringeth  the  holy  Chrism,  and  the  coffer  for 
the  holy  relics,  which  is  beneath  the  Altar.  After  him  the  Sub-Deacon  bringeth  the 
wax-mastic,  somewhat  cooled.  And  the  Bishop  taketh  the  holy  relics,  unfolding 
them  from  the  paper  in  which  they  have  been  wrapped,  in  three  portions,  encased  in 
wax,  and  placeth  them  in  the  coffer,  having  first  anointed  them  with  the  holy 
Chrism;  and  poureth  of  the  wax-mastic,  and  giveth  the  coffer  to  the  Sacristan. 

And  the  Sacristan,  taking  it,  and  kissing  the  holy  hand  of  the  Bishop,  closeth  the 
coffer,  and  layeth  it  under  the  Altar,  in  the  central  pillar. 

Then  the  Bishop  layeth  the  prepared  particles  in  the  corporal  {or  corporals),  having 
first  anointed  inside  a  little  bag  in  the  centre  of  each  corporal  with  the  holy  Chrism, 
and  maketh  them  fast  with  wax-mastic  with  a  special  small  paddle.  (14) 

[When  there  is  no  other  church  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Temple  to  be  consecrated,  the 
holy  relics  are  set,  in  the  same  manner,  on  the  preceding  evening,  upon  a  lectern  in 
front  of  the  holy  picture  (ikona)  of  the  Saviour,  in  the  Temple  which  is  to  be  conse- 
crated. And  when  the  time  is  come  to  go  for  the  holy  relics,  the  Bishop  issueth 
forth  from  the  doors  of  the  Church,  and  standeth  over  against  the  relics,  on  his  eagle 
rug,  and  praying,  he  blesseth  his  fellow-clergy;  and  the  Bishop  taketh  the  censer, 
and  censeth  the  holy  relics  thrice:  and  the  Choir  singeth  the  Hymn  already  set  forth 
(page  503) :  Thy  Church  which,  in  all  the  world,  .  .  .  Glory  now,  .  . ;  and 
the  Collect-Hymn:  The  universe  offereth  unto  thee,  O  Lord,  .  .     (See  page  504.) 

And  when  the  Choir  hath  finished  singing,  the  Proto-Deacon  saith  the  Little  Litany: 
Again,  yet  again,  (page  502)  before  the  holy  relics,  and  all  things  are  done 

according  to  the  ritual,  as  herein  before  set  forth.  And  the  Bishop  taketh  the  holy 
relics  on  his  head,  and  goeth  with  the  cross  round  about  the  Church,  according  to  the 
ritual.  And  when  it  is  in  no  wise  possible  to  make  the  circuit  of  the  Church  with 
the  holy  relics,  then  they  go  forth  before  the  great  door  of  the  Temple,  and  the 
Bishop  setteth  the  holy  relics  on  the  table  there  made  ready,  and  doeth  reverence  to 
the  holy  relics,  and  taketh  the  censer  from  the  Proto-Deacon,  and  censeth  the  holy 
relics  three  times;  and  everything  is  done  according  to  the  order  already  prescribed. 
And  after  all  hath  been  accomplished,  the  Bishop  setteth  the  holy  relics  on  his  head, 
and  having  blessed  therewith  the  great  door  of  the  church,  he  setteth  them  again  upon 
his  head;  and  entering  the  Sanctuary,  he  maketh  the  circuit  of  the  Sanctuary  once 
with  the  holy  relics,  instead  of  going  round  about  the  Temple,  as  should  have  been 
done;  and  he  setteth  the  holy  relics  upon  the  holy  Altar,  and  layeth  them  in  the  coffer, 
and  in  the  corporals,  and  doth  the  rest,  according  to  the  order  set  forth  above.} 

And  when  this  hath  been  accomplished,  the  Proto-Deacon  saith: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Priests.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

The  Bishop  saith  the  following  Prayer: 
O  Lord  our  God,  who  hast  bestowed  upon  the  holy  Martyrs  which 
suffered  for  thy  sake  this  glory  also,  that  their  relics  should  be  sown 
abroad  in  all  the  earth,  in  thy  holy  churches,  and  should  bring  forth  fruits 


THE  OFFICE  AT  THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH         509 

of  healing:  Do  thou,  the  same  Master,  who  art  the  giver  of  all  good  things, 
through  the  intercessions  of  the  saints  whose  relics  thou  hast  graciously 
permitted  to  be  placed  in  this  thy  most  honourable  Altar  {these  thy  most 
honourable  Altars),  enable  us  uncondemned  to  offer  unto  thee  thereon  the 
unbloody  sacrifice:  And  grant  us  all  those  petitions  which  are  unto  salva- 
tion, vouchsafing  also  to  the  relics  therein  of  those  who  have  suffered  for 
thy  holy  Name,  that  they  may  work  miracles  unto  our  salvation. 

Exclamation. 

For  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

The  Priests.  Amen. 

Then  the  Proto-Deacon  saith: 
Again,  yet  again,  on  bended  knees,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  Bishop,  kneeling  {and  the  people  there  present  in  the  Temple  kneel  also) 
reciteth,  in  the  hearing  of  all,  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God,  who  by  thy  word  alone  didst  bring  into  existence 
creation,  and  who  in  unutterable  wise  didst  adorn  it  diversely,  and  didst 
send  down  thy  Holy  Spirit,  gathering  it  together,  and  hast  poured  forth 
this  light  of  the  sun  unto  its  renewal;  who  didst  inspire  Moses,  well-pleas- 
ing in  thy  sight,  to  add  unto  thine  exceedingly  good  creation  a  certain 
special  praise,  and  to  say :  Thou  didst  behold  the  light,  that  it  was  good, 
and  didst  call  it  Day:  which,  also,  we  have  beheld,  even  this  most  radiant 
sun  that  every  day  reneweth  creation,  and  do  glorify  thee,  the  Sun  of  the 
true  day,  and  thy  light  which  hath  no  setting;  Who,  through  thy  Son,  hast 
commanded  us  to  renew  our  nature  by  thy  Holy  Spirit,  that  through  the 
gift  thereof  thy  Saints  may  shine  like  the  sun :  We  pray  thee,  and  beseech 
thee,  the  Father  of  the  Word,  our  Lord  and  our  God  (forasmuch  as, 
through  thine  unutterable  love  toward  mankind  and  thy  boundless  mercy, 
creation  and  the  ancient  covenant,  — ■  which  was  the  image  of  the  new 
covenant,  —  in  thy  divine  revelation  of  thyself  on  Mount  Sinai,  and  that 
wondrous  Bush  that  burned,  and  the  tabernacle  of  assembly,  and  the 
exceeding  beautiful  Temple  of  Solomon,  received  renewal) :  with  merciful 
eyes  look  thou  upon  us,  thy  sinful  and  unworthy  servants,  who  are  here 
present  in  this  house  like  unto  heaven,  which  is  the  praise  of  the  universe, 
a  true  altar  of  thine  ineffable  glory.  And  send  down  upon  us,  and  upon 
thine  inheritance  thy  most  Holy  Spirit,  and  after  the  manner  of  the 
divine  David  renew  within  our  hearts  a  right  spirit,  and  establish  us  with 
thy  sovereign  Spirit.  And  grant  unto  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N., 
victories  and  conquests  over  enemies  both  visible  and  invisible;  and  unto 
us  peace  and  concord.  And  give  remission  of  sins  to  those  who  have 
diligently  completed  this  building  and  consecration  of  a  temple  out  of 
love  to  thee,  O  God:  Grant  them  those  petitions  which  are  unto  salva-

tion;  stir  them  up  to  do  thy  commandments;  vouchsafe  unto  them  the 
renewal  of  the  gift  of  thy  Holy  Spirit,  that  uncondemned  they  may  wor- 
ship thee,  the  only  true  God,  and  Jesus  Christ  whom  thou  hast  sent: 
Through  the  prayers  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (and  of  N.,  the  Samt  to 
whom  the  Church  is  dedicated),  and  all  of  thy  Saints.     Amen. 

And  after  the  Prayer  the  Bishop  riseth,  as  do  likewise  the  others,  and  the  Proto- 

Deacon  saith: 
Succour  us,  save  us,  have  mercy  upon  us,  raise  us  up,  and  keep  us,  O 
God,  by  thy  grace. 

(And  the  rest  of  the  Little  Litany.     See  page  502.) 

The  Ascription:  The  Bishop. 

For  holy  art  thou,  O  our  God,  and  restest  on  the  holy,  honourable 

Martyrs,  who  have  suffered  for  thy  sake;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe 

glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 

ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Bishop  goeth  to  the  place  where  he  is  vested,  if  such  a  place  there  be,  with 
his  pastoral  staff.  But  if  there  be  no  vesting-place,  he  standeth  on  the  tribune 
in  front  of  the  Sanctuary.  And  the  Priests  take  their  stand  on  either  side,  accord- 
ing to  the  ritual.  And  when  the  Bishop  hath  stood  there  and  prayed,  he  blesseth 
those  present. 

The  Proto-Deacon  reciteth  the  Litany. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  1$ 

Here  follow  petitions  for  the  Ruler  of  the  Land  and  for  all  the  Authorities,  accord- 
ing to  the  elements  and  nationalities  of  which  the  Parish  is  constituted. 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  our  Most  Holy  Synod  (or  Patriarch) ; 
for  our  Bishop  (or  Archbishop,  or  Metropolitan),  N. :  1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  all  their  Christ-loving  Army  and  Navy,  fy 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  the  blessed  and  ever-memorable  founders 
of  this  holy  Temple.  1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  mercy,  life,  peace,  health,  salvation, 
forgiveness  and  remission  of  sins  for  the  servants  of  God,  our  brethren 
of  this  holy  Temple,  fy 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  those  who  bear  fruit  and  do  good  work  in 
this  holy  and  all-honourable  Temple :  for  those  who  labour  in  its  ser- 
vice ;  for  the  singers,  and  for  the  people  here  present,  who  await  in  firm 
hope  the  great  and  rich  mercies  which  are  from  thee.  1$ 

And  the  Bishop  maketh  the  Exclamation. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  do  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen.

Then  the  Sacristan  bringeth  to  the  Bishop  a  cross  upon  a  salver.  And  the  Bishop 
taketh  the  cross,  and  standing  on  that  same  vesting-place  {or  on  the  tribune  before 
the  Sanctuary)  blesseth  thrice  with  the  cross,  on  all  four  sides:  to  the  east,  and  the 
west,  and  the  south,  and  the  north.  And  the  Proto-Deacon  censeth  over  against  the 
cross  thrice  on  each  side,  and  passing  over,  saith:  Let  us  all  say,  Lord,  have 
mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

After  the  blessing,  the  Proto-Deacon  saith:  Wisdom! 

And  the  Bishop,  laying  the  cross  upon  the  Sacristan's  salver,  goeth  (if  he  hath  been 
standing  upon  the  vesting-place)  to  the  tribune  before  the  Sanctuary,  bearing  his 
pastoral  staff,  saying: 

O  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  save  us. 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Bishop.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God  our  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  .  .  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.') 
Master,  bless. 

And  the  Bishop,  ascending  the  tribune,  and  giving  his  pastoral  staff,  again  taketh  the 
cross,  and  giveth  the  Benediction  with  the  cross.  And  after  the  Benediction  the 
Proto-Deacon  proclaimeth  Many  years.  And  after  the  Many  years,  the  Deacon 
bringeth  the  Bishop  holy  water  And  the  Bishop  sprinkleth  with  the  holy  water  the 
wall,  west,  north  and  south.  After  the  sprinkling,  the  Bishop  himself  kisseth  the 
precious  cross,  and  after  him  the  other  Ecclesiastics  and  the  People  kiss  it  likewise; 
and  he  sprinkleth  each  of  them  with  holy  water.  And  while  the  People  salute  it,  the 
Choir  singeth:  Many  Years.     (See  page  549.) 

And  when  this  hath  been  sung,  the  Hours  are  begun.  At  the  Liturgy,  the  Gradual 
(Prokimen)  of  the  Consecration  and  of  the  Saint  of  the  Temple  are  used.  The 
Epistle  is:  Hebrews  ix.  1-8,  and  that  of  the  Temple.  The  Gospel  is:  John  x.  22- 
27,  and  that  of  the  Temple. 


A  SERVICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  FOR  AN  ANSWER 
TO  PRAYER,  AND  FOR  EVERY  FAVOUR  FROM 
GOD 

Everv  Orthodox  Christian  should  know  in  ivhat  manner  he  is  bound  to  return  thanks 
to  God  our  Benefactor,  for  every  answer  to  prayer,  and  for  every  favour  received  at 
his  hands,  whether  for  the  soul  or  body;  either  individually  or  for  all  the  people; 
either  privately  in  his  own  chamber  or  publicly  in  church. 

If  the  following  Thanksgiving  is  to  be  celebrated,  not  in  connection  with  the  Liturgy 
but  after  the  Matins  or  Vesper  Service,  the  Priest,  vested  in  his  stole  and  chasuble, 
and  standing  in  front  of  the  holy  A  Itar  after  having  censed  the  same  in  the  form  of  a 
cross,  beginneth  as  follows: 

Glory  to  the  Holy,  and  Consubstantial,  and  Undivided  Trinity,  always, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen. 

Then  is  read: 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain;  and  save 
our  souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us. 
(Thrice.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to'  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  in- 
firmities, for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the  Father, 
and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come, 
let  us  worship  and  fall  down  before  him.     (Three  reverences.) 


A  SERVICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  513 

Psalm  cxviii. 

O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious:  because  his  mercy 
endureth  forever.  Let  Israel  now  confess  that  he  is  gracious,  and  that 
his  mercy  endureth  forever.  Let  the  house  of  Aaron  now  confess  that  his 
mercy  endureth  forever.  Yea,  let  them  now  that  fear  the  Lord  confess 
that  his  mercy  endureth  forever.  I  called  upon  the  Lord  in  trouble,  and 
the  Lord  heard  me  at  large.  The  Lord  is  on  my  side,  I  will  not  fear  what 
man  doeth  unto  me.  The  Lord  taketh  my  part  with  them  that  help  me, 
therefore  shall  I  see  my  desire  upon  mine  enemies.  It  is  better  to  trust 
in  the  Lord  than  to  put  any  confidence  in  man.  It  is  better  to  trust  in  the 
Lord  than  to  put  any  confidence  in  princes.  All  nations  compassed  me 
round  about;  but  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord  will  I  destroy  them.  They 
kept  me  in  on  every  side,  they  kept  me  in,  I  say,  on  every  side,  but  in  the 
Name  of  the  Lord  will  I  destroy  them.  They  came  about  me  like  bees, 
and  are  extinct  even  as  the  fire  among  the  thorns ;  for  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord  will  I  destroy  them.  Thou  hast  thrust  sore  at  me,  that  I  might  fall : 
but  the  Lord  was  my  help.  The  Lord  is  my  strength  and  my  song,  and  is 
become  my  salvation.  The  voice  of  joy  and  health  is  in  the  dwellings  of 
the  righteous:  the  right  hand  of  the  Lord  bringeth  mighty  things  to  pass. 
The  right  hand  of  the  Lord  hath  the  preeminence;  the  right  hand  of  the 
Lord  bringeth  mighty  things  to  pass.  I  shall  not  die,  but  live,  and  de- 
clare the  works  of  the  Lord.  The  Lord  hath  chastened  and  corrected  me, 
but  he  hath  not  given  me  over  unto  death.  Open  me  the  gates  of  right- 
eousness, that  I  may  go  into  them,  and  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord.  This 
is  the  gate  of  the  Lord :  the  righteous  shall  enter  into  it.  I  will  thank  thee, 
for  thou  hast  heard  me,  and  art  become  my  salvation.  The  same  stone 
which  the  builders  rejected  is  become  the  head-stone  in  the  corner.  This 
is  the  Lord's  doing,  and  it  is  marvellous  in  our  eyes.  This  is  the  day  the 
Lord  hath  made :  we  will  rejoice  and  be  glad  in  it.  Help  me  now,  O  Lord : 
O  Lord,  send  us  now  prosperity.  Blessed  be  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name 
of  the  Lord.  We  have  wished  you  good  luck,  ye  that  are  of  the  house 
of  the  Lord.  God  is  the  Lord  who  hath  showed  us  light:  bind  the  sacrifice 
with  cords,  yea,  even  unto  the  horns  of  the  altar.  Thou  art  my  God, 
and  I  will  thank  thee.  O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious, 
and  his  mercy  endureth  forever. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.     Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     (Thrice.) 

Then  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  customary  Litany. 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.

A  SERVICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  515 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Priest.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto

Choir.  Amen. 

Then:  God  is  the  Lord,  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us.  Blessed  is 
he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Verse  (Stikh)  1:  O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious;  be- 
cause his  mercy  endureth  forever. 

Verse  2 :  All  the  nations  compassed  me  about,  but  in  the  Name  of  the

And  the  following  Hymns  (Tr  opart),  in  Tone  IV.: 

We,  thine  unworthy  servants,  O  Lord,  grateful  for  thy  great  benefits 
which  thou  hast  showed  upon  us,  glorifying  thee  do  praise,  bless,  give 
thanks,  sing,  and  magnify  thy  loving-kindness,  and  with  love  do  cry 
aloud  unto  thee  in  humble  submissiveness :  O  our  Benefactor  and  our 
Saviour,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  (Tone 
III.) 

O  Master,  who  hast  freely  vouchsafed  thy  benefits  and  gifts  unto  thine 
unprofitable  servants,  zealously  resorting  unto  thee,  we  offer  unto  thee 
thanksgiving  according  to  our  strength,  and  glorifying  thee  as  our 
Benefactor  and  our  Creator,  we  cry  aloud:  Glory  to  thee,  O  God  most

O  Birth-giver  of  God,  the  Helper  of  Christians,  having  acquired  thy

most  pure  Virgin  Birth-giver  of  God!  And  from  all  calamities  deliver

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. — • — Reader.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom!     Let  us  attend. 

Reader.  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  I  will  sing

Verse:  My  heart  shall  rejoice  in  thy  salvation. 

Then  the  Epistle  is  read: 
(Ephesians  v.  8-21.)  Brethren,  walk  ye  as  children  of  the  light  (for 
the  fruit  of  the  Spirit  is  in  all  goodness  and  righteousness  and  truth);

proving  what  is  acceptable  unto  the  Lord.  And  have  no  fellowship 
with  the  unfruitful  works  of  darkness,  but  rather  reprove  them.  For  it 
is  a  shame  even  to  speak  of  those  things  which  are  done  of  them  in  secret. 
But  all  things  that  are  discovered  are  made  manifest  by  the  light:  for 
whatsoever  doth  make  manifest  is  light.  Wherefore  he  saith,  Awake 
thou  that  sleepest,  and  arise  from  the  dead,  and  Christ  shall  give  thee 
light.  See  then  that  ye  walk  circumspectly,  not  as  fools,  but  as  wise, 
redeeming  the  time,  because  the  days  are  evil.  Wherefore  be  ye  not 
unwise,  but  understanding  what  the  will  of  the  Lord  is.  And  be  not 
drunk  with  wine,  wherein  is  excess;  but  be  filled  with  the  Spirit;  speaking 
to  yourselves  in  psalms  and  hymns  and  spiritual  songs,  singing  and 
making  melody  in  your  heart  to  the  Lord ;  giving  thanks  always  for  all 
things  unto  God  and  the  Father,  in  the  name  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ: 
submitting  yourselves  one  to  another  in  the  fear  of  God. 

[On  Days  commemorating  Victories: 

(2  Cor.  ii.  14-16.)  Now,  brethren,  thanks  be  unto  God,  which  always 
causeth  us  to  triumph  in  Christ,  and  maketh  manifest  the  savour  of  his 
knowledge  to  us  in  every  place.  For  we  are  unto  God  a  sweet  savour 
of  Christ,  in  them  that  are  saved,  and  in  them  that  perish:  To  the  one 
we  are  the  savour  of  death  unto  death;  and  to  the  other  the  savour  of 
life  unto  life.     And  who  is  sufficient  for  these  things? 

(1  Tim.  i.  17.)  Now  unto  the  King  eternal,  immortal,  invisible,  the 
only  wise  God,  be  honour  and  glory  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.] 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee. 

Reader.  And  to  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  Alleluia,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

Deacon.  And  that  he  will  graciously  vouchsafe  unto  us  to  hear  his 
Holy  Gospel,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  believers!     Let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  Luke. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

The  Priest  then  readeth  the  Gospel. 
(Luke  xvii.  12-iQ.)  And  as  Jesus  entered  into  a  certain  village,  there 
met  him  ten  men  that  were  lepers,  which  stood  afar  off:  and  they  lifted 
up  their  voices,  and  said,  Jesus,  Master,  have  mercy  on  us.  And  when 
he  saw  them,  he  said  unto  them,  Go  show  yourselves  unto  the  priests. 
And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  they  went,  they  were  cleansed.  And  one 
of  them,  when  he  saw  that  he  was  healed,  turned  back,  and  with  a  loud 


A  SERVICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  517 

voice  glorified  God.  And  fell  down  on  his  face  at  his  feet,  giving  him 
thanks:  and  he  was  a  Samaritan.  And  Jesus  answering  said,  Were 
there  not  ten  cleansed?  but  where  are  the  nine?  There  are  not  found 
that  returned  to  give  glory  to  God,  save  this  stranger.  And  he  said  unto 
him,  Arise,  go  thy  way:  thy  faith  hath  made  thee  whole. 
Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee. 

And  immediately  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  following  Litany: 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  1$ 

Returning  thanks  with  fear  and  trembling,  as  unprofitable  servants, 
unto  thy  loving- kindness,  O  Lord,  our  Saviour  and  our  Master,  for 
thy  benefits  which  thou  hast  poured  out  abundantly  upon  thy  ser- 
vants, we  fall  down  in  worship,  and  offer  unto  thee  praise  as  God,  and 
with  fervour  do  cry  aloud  unto  thee:  Deliver  thou  thy  servants 
from  all  calamities,  and  in  that  thou  art  merciful  fulfil  thou  always 
the  desires  of  us  all  as  may  be  expedient  for  us,  we  diligently  entreat 
thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  Ц 

In  that  thou  now  hast  mercifully  hearkened  unto  the  supplica- 
tions of  thy  servants,  O  Lord,  and  hast  manifested  upon  us  the  ten- 
der compassion  of  thy  love  for  mankind,  so  also,  in  time  to  come, 
despising  us  not,  do  thou  fulfil,  unto  thy  glory,  all  good  desires  of  thy 
faithful  people,  and  reveal  unto  us  all  thy  rich  mercy,  disregarding 
all  our  iniquities,  we  beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  fy 

And  may  this  our  thanksgiving  be  as  sweet-smelling  incense,  as 
a  fat  whole  burnt-offering  before  the  majesty  of  thy  glory,  O  all- 
gracious  Master;  and  send  thou  down  always  upon  thy  servants,  in 
that  thou  art  beneficent,  thy  rich  mercies  and  bounties;  and  deliver 
from  all  assaults  of  enemies,  both  visible  and  invisible,  thy  holy 
Church,  and  this  city;  and  grant  unto  all  thy  people  length  of  days, 
sinless  and  healthful,  and  increase  in  all  virtue,  we  beseech  thee,  O 
all-bountiful  King:  mercifully  hearken,  and  speedily  show  mercy.  1$ 

Exclamation. 

Priest.  Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the 
earth,  and  of  those  who  are  far  off  upon  the  sea;  and  show  mercy,  show 
mercy,  O  Master,  upon  us  sinners,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

And  making  three  reverences  before  the  holy  Altar,  the  Deacon  saith: 
Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.

5i8  A  SERVICE  OF  THANKSGIVING 

Then  the  Priest,  with  all  heed  and  devoutness,  readeth  the  following  Prayer,  aloud : 
O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  the  God  of  all  mercies  and  bounties, 
whose  mercy  is  immeasurable,  and  whose  love  for  mankind  is  an  un- 
fathomable deep:  falling  down  in  adoration  before  thy  majesty,  with 
fear  and  trembling,  as  unprofitable  servants,  and  now  humbly  rendering 
thanks  unto  thy  loving-kindness  for  thy  benefits  bestowed  upon  thy 
servants,  NN  (or  upon  thy  servant,  N.),  we  glorify  thee,  we  praise  thee, 
we  sing  thee,  and  we  magnify  thee  as  our  Lord,  and  Master,  and  Bene- 
factor; and  again  falling  down  before  thee,  we  humbly  thank  thee, 
supplicating  thy  boundless  and  inexpressible  mercy.  And  in  that  thou 
hast  now  graciously  vouchsafed  to  accept  the  petitions  of  thy  servants 
and  to  fulfil  them,  so  also  grant  that  henceforth  thy  holy  Church  and 
this  city  may  be  delivered  from  every  hostile  assault,  and  may  be  vouch- 
safed peace  and  tranquillity,  and  that  increasing  in  true  love  of  thee, 
and  in  all  virtues,  all  thy  faithful  people  may  receive  all  thy  benefits; 
and  that  we  may  ever  offer  thanksgiving  unto  thee,  together  with  thy 
Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life- 
giving  Spirit,  God  glorified  in  one  Person;  and  that  we  may  say  exceed- 
ing good  things,  and  sing: 

And  immediately  he  exclaimeth,  in  a  very  loud  voice: 
Glory  to  thee,  O  God  our  Benefactor,  unto  ages  of  ages. 

And  standing  in  the  centre  of  the  Church,  the  Choir  singeth:  Amen. 

Then  immediately  is  sung  the  Great  Anthem  of  Praise:  Glory  be  to  God  on  high  [see 
pag?  34):  Or  instead,,  the  Anthem  of  St.  Ambrose,  Bishop  of  Milan,  is  sung:  We 
praise  thee,  0  God,  (See  page  539.) 

And  when  it  is  finished,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Wisdom ! 

Reader.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  Amen.  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Thrice.) 
Bless. 

And  the  Priest  pronounceth  the  customary  Benediction 
May  Christ,   our  true  God,   through   the  prayers  of  his  most  holy 
Mother,  of  Saint  N    (the  Saint  for  the  day),  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have 
mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good  and  loveth  mankind. 
And  blessing  the  People  with  his  hand,  he  saith: 
May  the  blessing  of  the  Lord,  through  his  grace,  and  bounties,  and 
love  of  mankind,  be  upon  you  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen.

Psalm  xxxiv. 

I  will  alway  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord;  his  praise  shall  ever  be  in 
my  mouth.  My  soul  shall  make  her  boast  in  the  Lord;  the  humble 
shall  hear  thereof,  and  be  glad.  O  praise  the  Lord  with  me,  and  let  us 
magnify  his  Name  together.  I  sought  the  Lord,  and  he  heard  me;  yea, 
he  delivered  me.  out  of  all  my  fear.  They  had  an  eye  unto  him,  and 
were  lightened;  and  their  faces  were  not  ashamed.  Lo,  the  poor  crieth, 
and  the  Lord  heareth  him;  yea,  and  saveth  him  out  of  all  his  troubles. 
The  angel  of  the  Lord  tarrieth  round  about  them  that  fear  him,  and 
delivereth  them.  O  taste,  and  see,  how  gracious  the  Lord  is:  blessed 
is  the  man  that  trusteth  in  him.  O  fear  the  Lord,  ye  that  are  his  saints; 
for  they  that  fear  him  lack  nothing.  The  lions  do  lack,  and  suffer  hun- 
ger; but  they  who  seek  the  Lord  shall  want  no  manner  of  thing  that  is 
good.  Come,  ye  children,  and  hearken  unto  me;  I  will  teach  you  the 
fear  of  the  Lord.  What  man  is  he  that  lusteth  to  live,  and  would  fain  see 
good  days?  Keep  thy  tongue  from  evil,  and  thy  lips,  that  they  speak  no 
guile.  Eschew  evil,  and  do  good;  seek  peace,  and  ensue  it.  The  eyes  of 
the  Lord  are  over  the  righteous,  and  his  ears  are  open  unto  their  prayers. 
The  countenance  of  the  Lord  is  against  them  that  do  evil,  to  root  out 
the  remembrance  of  them  from  the  earth.  The  righteous  cry,  and 
the  Lord  heareth  them,  and  delivereth  them  out  of  all  their  troubles. 
The  Lord  is  nigh  unto  them  that  are  of  a  contrite  heart,  and  will  save 
such  as  be  of  an  humble  spirit.  Great  are  the  troubles  of  the  righteous; 
but  the  Lord  delivereth  him  out  of  all.  He  keepeth  all  his  bones,  so  that 
not  one  of  them  is  broken.  But  misfortune  shall  slay  the  ungodly;  and 
they  that  hate  the  righteous  shall  be  desolate.  The  Lord  delivereth 
the  souls  of  his  servants;  and  all  they  that  put  their  trust  in  him  shall 
not  be  destitute. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen.     Alleluia.     (Thrice.)

unto  Christ  our  God. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

Exclamation. 

For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the  Father,  and 
to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir    Amen. 

Then  the  following  Hymns  (Tropari)  are  read.     Tone  VI.: 

As  thou  didst  come  into  the  midst  of  thy  Disciples,  O  Saviour,  be- 
stowing upon  them  peace,  so  also  come  thou  unto  us,  and  save  us. 

Of  thine  unlettered  Disciples  thy  Holy  Spirit  made  teachers,  O  Christ- 
God  ;  and  by  the  commingling  of  tongues  He  annulled  idolatry  in  that  He 
is  almighty. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  (Tone 
VIII.)

A  SERVICE  OF  PRAYER  FOR  CHILDREN  521 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Christ  our  God,  who  hast  revealed  fishers  most 
wise,  sending  down  upon  them  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  thereby  catching 
the  universe  as  in  a  net.  O  Christ  our  God,  who  lovest  mankind,  glory 
to  thee. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  Protection  of  Christians  that  maketh  not  ashamed,  O  Mediatrix 
never-failing  with  the  Creator :  Despise  not  the  sinners'  voice  of  supplica- 
tion; but  in  that  thou  art  good,  come  speedily  to  the  aid  of  us  who  faith- 
fully call  upon  thee;  make  haste  to  our  petition  and  further  our  prayer, 
O  Birth-giver  of  God,  who  ever  protectest  them  that  do  thee  honour. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Reader.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom!     Let  us  attend. 

Reader.  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone:  Out  of  the 
mouths  of  babes  and  sucklings  hast  thou  ordained  praise. 

Verse:  My  heart  shall  rejoice  in  thy  salvation. 

Then  the  Reader  readeth  the  Epistle. 

(Ephesians  i.  16-iQ;  in.  16-21.)  Brethren:  I  cease  not  to  give  thanks 
for  you,  making  mention  of  you  in  my  prayers;  that  the  God  of  our  Lord 
Jesus  Christ,  the  Father  of  glory,  may  give  unto  you  the  spirit  of  wisdom 
and  revelation  in  the  knowledge  of  him:  the  eyes  of  your  understanding 
being  enlightened ;  that  ye  may  know  what  is  the  hope  of  his  calling,  and 
what  the  riches  of  the  glory  of  his  inheritance  in  the  saints,  and  what  is  the 
exceeding  greatness  of  his  power  to  usward  who  believe,  according  to  the 
working  of  his  mighty  power.  And  that  ye  may  know  the  love  of  Christ 
which  passeth  knowledge,  that  ye  might  be  filled  with  all  the  fulness  of 
God.  Now  unto  him  who  is  able  to  do  exceeding  abundantly  above  all 
that  we  ask  or  think,  according  to  the  power  that  worketh  in  us,  unto 
him  be  glory  in  the  Church  by  Christ  Jesus,  throughout  all  ages,  world 
without  end.     Amen. 

Then  the  Deacon  saith:

(Mark  x.  13-16.)  At  that  time  they  brought  young  children  to  him, 
that  he  should  touch  them :  and  his  disciples  rebuked  those  that  brought 
them.  But  when  Jesus  saw  it,  he  was  much  displeased,  and  said  unto 
them,  Suffer  the  little  children  to  come  unto  me,  and  forbid  them  not;  for 
of  such  is  the  kingdom  of  God.     Verily  I  say  unto  you,  Whosoever  shall 


522  A  SERVICE  OF  PRAYER  FOR  CHILDREN 

not  receive  the  kingdom  of  God  as  a  little  child,  he  shall  not  enter  therein. 
And  he  took  them  up  in  his  arms,  put  his  hands  upon  them,  and  blessed 
them. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Deacon  reciteth  the  Augmented  Litany  as  far  as:  Furthermore  we  pray  for 
all  their  Christ-loving  Army  and  Navy.    {See  page  90.) 

Then:  Furthermore  we  pray  unto  the  Lord  our  God,  that  he  will  look 
graciously  upon  these  children,  and  will  send  down  into  their  hearts, 
their  minds,  and  their  lips  the  spirit  of  wisdom,  and  of  understanding,  and 
of  piety,  and  of  his  fear;  and  that  he  will  illumine  them  with  the  light  of 
his  knowledge,  and  will  bestow  upon  them  strength  and  steadfastness, 
that  they  may  quickly  apprehend  and  speedily  become  wonted  to  the  in- 
struction in  his  Divine  Law,  and  to  all  good  and  profitable  learning: 
furthermore,  that  he  will  prosper  them  in  wisdom  and  understanding, 
and  in  all  good  works  to  the  glory  of  his  holy  Name,  and  will  give  them 
health,  and  make  them  long-lived,  unto  the  building  up  and  the  glory  of 
his  Church,  let  us  all  say:  O  Lord,  hearken  and  mercifully  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Twelve  times.) 

Then  the  Priest  exclaimeth:  Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  .  .  .  (See  page  517.) 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

And  the  Priest,  with  all  heed  and  emotion,  readeth,  aloud,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  Lord  our  God  and  Creator,  who  hast  honoured  us  men  with  thine 
own  image ;  who  hast  taught  thine  elect,  so  that  most  wise  are  they  who 
give  heed  to  thy  teaching;  who  revealest  wisdom  unto  babes;  who  hast 
imparted  thy  teaching  unto  Solomon  and  unto  all  who  have  sought  thy 
wisdom :  Open  thou  the  hearts,  the  minds,  and  the  lips  of  these  thy  ser- 
vants, that  they  may  receive  the  power  of  thy  law,  and  successfully 
apprehend  the  useful  precepts  which  shall  be  taught  them,  to  the  glory  of 
thine  all-holy  Name,  to  the  profit  and  building  up  of  thy  holy  Church,  and 
that  they  may  understand  thy  good  and  perfect  will.  Deliver  them  from 
every  hostile  oppression;  preserve  them  in  Orthodoxy  and  the  faith,  and 
in  all  uprightness  and  purity  all  the  days  of  their  life,  that  they  may  ad- 
vance in  wisdom,  and  in  the  fulfilling  of  thy  commandments:  that,  being 
thus  prepared,  they  may  glorify  thine  all-holy  Name,  and  become  heirs 
of  thy  kingdom.  For  thou  art  God  mighty  in  mercy,  and  gracious  in 
strength;  and  unto  thee  is  due  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and 
to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 


A  SERVICE  OF  PRAYER  FOR  CHILDREN  523 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  our  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy-     {Thrice.)     Bless. 

And  the  customary  Benediction. 

May  Christ,  our  true  God,  through  the  prayers  of  his  all-holy  Mother; 
of  the  holy,  glorious  and  all-laudable  Apostles;  of  the  holy,  righteous  An- 
cestors of  God,  Joachim  and  Anna;  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon 
us,  and  save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  good,  and  loveth  mankind. 
Then  the  Priest,  blessing  the  Children  with  the  cross,  saith: 

The  blessing  of  the  Lord,  with  his  grace,  and  bounties,  and  love  to- 
ward mankind,  be  upon  you  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.     Amen. 

Then  the  Children  kiss  the  holy  cross,  and  the  Priest  sprinkleih  them  with  holy  water. 


THE  RITE  OF  BLESSING  FOR  A  JOURNEY 

The  Priest,  vested  in  his  priestly  stole  and  chasuble,  if  the  rite  be  said  apart  from  the 
Liturgy,  beginneth  as  usual: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Reader.  O  heavenly  King,  .  .  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  .  .  .  Our 
Father,  .  .  .  Lord,  have  mercy.  (Twelve  times.)  Glory  .  .  .  now  and 
ever,  .  .  .  O  come,  let  us  worship  .  .  .  (Thnce.)     (See  page  512.) 

Psalm  cxliii. 

Hear  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  consider  my  desire;  hearken  unto  me  for 
thy  truth  and  righteousness'  sake.  And  enter  not  into  judgment  with 
thy  servant;  for  in  thy  sight  shall  no  man  living  be  justified.  For  the 
enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul;  he  hath  smitten  my  life  down  to  the 
ground ;  he  hath  laid  me  in  the  darkness,  as  the  men  that  have  been  long 
dead.  Therefore  is  my  spirit  vexed  within  me,  and  my  heart  within  me 
is  desolate.  Yet  do  I  remember  the  time  past:  I  muse  upon  all  thy  works; 
yea  I  exercise  myself  in  the  works  of  thy  hands.  I  stretch  forth  my  hands 
unto  thee;  my  soul  gaspeth  unto  thee  as  a  thirsty  land.  Hear  me,  O  Lord, 
and  that  soon;  for  my  spirit  waxeth  faint:  hide  not  thy  face  from  me,  lest 
I  be  like  unto  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit.  O  let  me  hear  thy  loving- 
kindness  betimes  in  the  morning;  for  in  thee  is  my  trust:  show  thou  me 
the  way  that  I  should  walk  in;  for  I  lift  up  my  soul  unto  thee.  Deliver 
me,  O  Lord,  from  mine  enemies;  for  I  flee  unto  thee  to  hide  me.  Teach 
me  to  do  the  thing  that  pleaseth  thee ;  for  thou  art  my  God :  let  thy  loving 
Spirit  lead  me  forth  into  the  land  of  righteousness.  Quicken  me,  O  Lord, 
for  thy  Name's  sake;  and  for  thy  righteousness'  sake  bring  my  soul  out  of 
trouble.  And  of  thy  goodness  slay  mine  enemies,  and  destroy  all  them 
that  vex  my  soul;  for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.     Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     (Thrice.) 
And  the  Deacon,  if  there  be  one,  or  the  Priest  himself,  readeth  the  Litany: 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (See  page  80.)

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Deacon.  Wisdom!     Let  us  attend. 

The  Choir  singeth  the  Gradual  (Prokimen).     Tone  IV. 

Teach  me  thy  way,  O  Lord,  and  I  will  walk  therein,  for  unto  thee  have 
I  lifted  up  my  soul. 

Verse:  Deliver  me  from  mine  enemies,  O  Lord;  unto  thee  have  I  fled 
for  refuge. 

The  Epistle:  Acts  viii.  26-39.  And  in  those  days  the  Angel  of  the  Lord 
spake  unto  Philip,  saying,  Arise,  and  go  toward  the  south,  unto  the  way 
that  goeth  down  from  Jerusalem  unto  Gaza,  which  is  a  desert.  And  he 
arose  and  went:  and,  behold,  a  man  of  Ethiopia,  an  eunuch  of  great 
authority  under  Candace,  Queen  of  the  Ethiopians,  who  had  the  charge 
of  all  her  treasure,  and  had  come  to  Jerusalem  for  to  worship,  was  return- 
ing; and  sitting  in  his  chariot,  read  Esaias  the  prophet.  Then  the  Spirit 
said  unto  Philip,  Go  near,  and  join  thyself  to  this  chariot.  And  Philip 
ran  thither  to  him,  and  heard  him  read  the  prophet  Esaias,  and  said, 
Understandest  thou  what  thou  readest?  And  he  said,  How  can  I,  ex- 
cept some  man  should  guide  me?  And  he  desired  Philip  that  he  would 
come  up  and  sit  with  him.  The  place  of  the  scripture  which  he  read  was 
this,  He  was  led  as  a  sheep  to  the  slaughter;  and  like  a  lamb  dumb  before 
his  shearer,  so  opened  he  not  his  mouth:  in  his  humiliation  his  judgment 
was  taken  away :  and  who  shall  declare  his  generation  ?  for  his  life  is  taken 
from  the  earth.  And  the  eunuch  answered  Philip,  and  said,  I  pray  thee, 
of  whom  speaketh  the  prophet  this?  of  himself,  or  of  some  other  man? 
Then  Philip  opened  his  mouth,  and  began  at  the  same  scripture,  and 
preached  unto  him  Jesus.  And  as  they  went  on  their  way,  the>  came 
unto  a  certain  water:  and  the  eunuch  said,  See,  here  is  water;  what  doth 
hinder  me  to  be  baptized?  And  Philip  said,  If  thou  believest  with  all 
thine  heart,  thou  mayest.  And  he  answered  and  said,  I  believe  that 
Jesus  Christ  is  the  son  of  God.  And  he  commanded  the  chariot  to  stand 
still:  and  they  went  down  both  into  the  water,  both  Philip  and  the  eunuch; 
and  he  baptized  him.  And  when  they  were  come  up  out  of  the  water  the 
Spirit  of  the  Lord  caught  away  Philip,  that  the  eunuch  saw  him  no  more; 
and  he  went  on  his  way  rejoicing. 

Alleluia.     (According  to  the  Tone.) 

Verse  1 :  The  footsteps  of  a  man  are  guided  by  the  Lord :  he  hath  longed

THE  RITE  OF  BLESSING  FOR  A  JOURNEY  527 

Verse  2:  Reveal  thy  path  unto  the  Lord,  and  trust  in  him,  and  he 
shall  bring  it  to  pass. 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  believers!     Let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  according  to  John. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Priest.  Let  us  attend. 

(John  xiv.  1-10.)  The  Lord  said  unto  his  disciples:  Let  not  your 
heart  be  troubled:  ye  believe  in  God,  believe  also  in  me.  In  my  Father's 
house  are  many  mansions:  if  it  were  not  so  I  would  have  told  you.  I 
go  to  prepare  a  place  for  you.  And  if  I  go  and  prepare  a  place  for  you, 
I  will  come  again,  and  receive  you  unto  myself;  that  where  I  am,  there 
ye  may  be  also.  And  whither  I  go  ye  know,  and  the  way  ye  know. 
Thomas  saith  unto  him,  Lord,  we  know  not  whither  thou  goest,  and  how 
can  we  know  the  way?  Jesus  saith  unto  him,  I  am  the  way,  and  the 
truth,  and  the  life:  no  man  cometh  unto  the  Father,  but  by  me.  If  ye 
had  known  me,  ye  should  have  known  my  Father  also:  and  from  hence- 
forth ye  know  him,  and  have  seen  him.  Philip  saith  unto  him,  Lord, 
show  us  the  Father,  and  it  sufficeth  us.  Jesus  saith  unto  him,  Have  I 
been  so  long  time  with  you,  and  yet  hast  thou  not  known  me,  Philip? 
he  that  hath  seen  me  hath  seen  the  Father;  and  how  sayest  thou  then, 
Show  us  the  Father?  Believest  thou  not  that  I  am  in  the  Father,  and 
the  Father  in  me? 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 
And  after  the  Gospel  the  Deacon  or  the  Priest  saith  this  Litany  (Ekteniya). 

O  Lord,  who  dost  guide  the  footsteps  of  man,  graciously  look 
upon  thy  servant,  N  (servants,  NN.) ;  and  pardoning  him  (her,  them) 
every  sin,  both  voluntary  and  involuntary,  bless  the  good  intention 
of  his  (her,  their)  counsel,  and  guide  his  (her,  their)  goings  out  and 
comings  in  on  the  journey,  we  earnestly  pray:  hearken,  and  have 
mercy.  1$ 

O  Lord,  who  didst  most  gloriously  deliver  Joseph  from  the  wrath 
of  his  brethren,  and  didst  lead  him  to  Egypt,  and  through  the  bless- 
ing of  thy  goodness  didst  make  him  to  prosper  in  all  things:  Bless 
also  this  thy  servant  (these  thy  servants)  who  purposeth  (purpose) 
to  travel,  and  cause  his  (her,  their)  journey  to  be  tranquil  and  pros- 
perous, we  pray  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  Ц, 

0  thou  who  didst  send  an  Angel  as  companion  on  their  way  unto 
Isaac  and  Tobias,  and  thereby  didst  ensure  unto  them  a  peaceful 
and  prosperous  journey,  and  return:  Send  now  also,  O  Most  Gra- 
cious One,  thine  Angel  of  Peace  unto  thy  servant  who  through  us 
entreateth  (servants  who  entreat)  thee,  that  he  may  guide  him  (her, 
them)  unto  every  good  deed ;  and  deliver  him  (her,  them)  from  enemies

528  THE  RITE  OF  BLESSING  FOR  A  JOURNEY 

both  visible  and  invisible,  and  from  every  evil  assault;  and  enable  him 
(her,  them)  to  return  in  safety,  peace  and  prosperity,  unto  thy 
glory,  we  earnestly  pray  thee:  hearken  and  have  mercy.  Ц 

O  thou  who  didst  accompany  Luke  and  Cleopas  on  the  way  to 
Emmaus,  and  didst  make  them  to  return  rejoicing  unto  Jerusalem 
through  that  most  glorious  knowledge  of  thee:  Accompany  thou 
now  also,  with  thy  grace  and  thy  blessing  divine,  this  thy  servant 
who  earnestly  prayeth  (these  thy  servants  who  earnestly  pray)  with 
us;  and  prosper  him  (her,  them)  in  every  good  work,  to  the  glory  of 
thine  all-holy  Name,  preserving  him  (her,  them)  in  health  and  well- 
being,  and  bringing  him  (her,  them)  back  again  in  due  season,  we 
pray  unto  thee,  as  unto  an  all-bountiful  benefactor:  hearken,  and 
have  mercy.  Ц 

And  the  Priest  exclaimeth:  Hear  us,  0  God  our  Saviour,  (See  page  517.) 

Deacon.  Bowing  our  heads  and  our  knees  devoutly  unto  the  Lord, 
let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     (Thrice.) 

And  all  kneeling,  the  Priest  turneth  toward  them;  and  the  Holy  Door  being  open,  he 
readeth,  in  a  loud  voice,  this  Prayer: 

O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  the  true  and  living  Way,  who  didst 
deign  to  journey  with  thine  ostensible  father  Joseph,  and  thine  All- 
pure  Virgin  Mother,  into  Egypt,  and  didst  accompany  Luke  and  Cleo- 
pas on  their  way  to  Emmaus:  We  now  humbly  entreat  thee,  O  all-holy 
Master,  accompany  now  with  thy  grace  this  thy  servant  (these  thy  ser- 
vants). And  send  unto  him  (her,  them),  as  unto  thy  servant  Tobias, 
an  angel  guardian  and  guide,  preserving  and  delivering  him  (her,  them) 
from  every  evil  assault  of  enemies  both  visible  and  invisible;  and  direct- 
ing him  (her,  them)  unto  the  fulfilment  of  thy  commandments;  and 
prospering  him  (her,  them)  in  peace,  happiness  and  health;  and  bring- 
ing him  (her,  them)  back  again  in  safety  and  tranquillity.  And  grant 
that  he  (she,  they)  may  fulfil  all  his  (her,  their)  good  purpose  unto  thy 
good  pleasure,  and  favourably  to  thy  glory.  For  thine  it  is  to  show 
mercy  and  to  save  us,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  together  with  thy 
Father  who  hath  no  beginning,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  blessed,  and  life- 
giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  the  Priest,  taking  the  holy  cross,  giveth  it  to  him  (her,  them)  to  kiss,  and 
sprinkleth  him  with  holy  water,  saying: 

May  the  Lord  bless  thee  (you)  out  of  Zion;  and  so  shalt  thou  (shall 
ye)  behold  the  good  things  of  Jerusalem  all  the  days  of  thy  (your)  life: 
and  may  he  direct  thy  (your)  journey  in  peace,  unto  the  glory  of  his 
holy  Name.     Amen. 

And  immediately  he  pronounceth  the  customary  Benediction  for  the  day. 


THE  RITE  OF  BLESSING  THOSE  WHO  ARE 
ABOUT  TO  TRAVEL  BY  WATER 

The  Priest,  vested  in  his  stole  and  chasuble,  beginneth  as  usual: 

Blessed  is  our  God  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Reader.  O  heavenly  King,  .  .     {See  page  512.)      O  Holy  God,  Holy 
Mighty,  .       Glory         now,    and    ever,  .  .     Our   Father,  .  .     For   thine 
is  the   kingdom,  .       Lord,    have   mercy        {Twelve   times.)      Glory  .  . 
now,  and  ever. 

0  come,  let  us  worship  Christ  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and 
fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 

Then  Psalm  cxxi 

1  will  lift  up  mine  eyes  unto  the  hills,  from  whence  cometh  my  help. 
My  help  cometh  even  from  the  Lord,  who  hath  made  heaven  and  earth. 
He  will  not  suffer  thy  foot  to  be  moved,  and  he  that  keepeth  Israel 
shall  neither  slumber  nor  sleep.  The  Lord  himself  is  thy  keeper:  the 
Lord  is  thy  defence  upon  thy  right  hand:  so  that  the  sun  shall  not  burn 
thee  by  day,  neither  the  moon  by  night.  The  Lord  shall  preserve  thee 
from  all  evil;  yea,  it  is  even  he  that  shall  keep  thy  soul.  The  Lord  shall 
preserve  thy  going  out  and  thy  coming  in,  from  this  time  forth,  even 
forevermore. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 
Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.     Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     {Thrice.) 

And  the  Deacon  saith  the  Great  Litany. 

In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {See  page  80.) 

And  the  rest,  as  far  as: 

For  those  who  travel  by  sea  or  by  land;  for  the  sick  and  the  suffering; 
for  those  who  are  in  captivity,  and  for  their  salvation :  let  us  pray  to  the 
Lord. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

That  he  will  be  merciful,  and  condescending,  and  easy  to  be  entreated 
toward  his  servant,  who  now,  through  us,  maketh  his  {her)  {servants  who 
now  make  their)  earnest  supplications  unto  him;  and  pardoning  all  his

Master,  both  aid  and  blessing.  But  forasmuch  as  of  old  thou  didst  by 
thy  word,  give  unto  thine  Apostles  tranquillity  upon  the  sea  in  'like 
manner  give  thou  now  also  unto  this  person  (these  persons)  a  calm  and

O  Saviour,  be  thou  the  helper  and  deliverer  of  him  (her)  who  hath

Reader  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  Though  I 
walk  through  the  valley  of  the  shadow  of  death,  I  will  fear  no  evil,  for 
thou  art  with  me. 

Verse:  And  thy  mercy  shall  follow  me  all  the  days  of  my  life. 

The  Epistle,  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles. 

(Acts  xxi.  1-7.)  And  in  those  days  it  came  to  pass,  that  after  we  were 
gotten  from  them,  and  had  launched,  we  came  with  a  straight  course 
unto  Coos,  and  on  the  day  following  unto  Rhodes,  and  from  thence  to 
Patras.  And  finding  a  ship  sailing  over  unto  Phenicia,  we  went  aboard, 
and  set  forth.  Now  when  we  had  discovered  Cyprus,  we  left  it  on  the 
left  hand,  and  sailed  unto  Syria,  and  landed  at  Tyre:  for  there  the  ship 
was  to  unlade  her  burden.  And  finding  disciples,  we  tarried  there  seven 
days:  who  said  unto  Paul  by  the  Spirit,  that  he  should  not  go  up  to 
Jerusalem.  And  when  we  had  accomplished  those  days,  we  departed 
and  went  our  way,  and  they  all  brought  us  on  our  way,  with  wives  and 
children,  till  we  were  out  of  the  city:  and  we  kneeled  down  on  the  shore 
and  prayed.  And  when  we  had  taken  our  leave  one  of  another,  we  took 
ship;  and  they  returned  home  again.  And  when  we  had  finished  our 
course  from  Tyre,  we  came  to  Ptolemais,  and  saluted  the  brethren,  and 
abode  with  them  one  day 

Alleluia.     (According  to  the  Tone.) 

Verse  1 :  Deliver  me  from  them  that  hate  me,  and  from  the  deep 
waters. 

Verse  2 :  Let  not  the  watery  tempest  drown  rae,  neither  let  the  deep 
swallow  me  up.

532     RITE  OF  BLESSING  THOSE  ABOUT  TO  TRAVEL  BY  WATER 

{Mark  iv.  35-41.)  The  Lord  said  unto  his  disciples,  Let  us  pass  over 
unto  the  other  side.  And  when  they  had  sent  away  the  multitude,  they 
took  him  even  as  he  was  in  the  ship:  and  there  were  also  with  him  other 
little  ships.  And  there  arose  a  great  storm  of  wind,  and  the  waves  beat 
into  the  ship,  so  that  it  was  now  full.  And  he  was  in  the  hinder  part  of 
the  ship,  asleep  on  a  pillow:  and  they  awake  him,  and  say  unto  him, 
Master,  carest  thou  not  that  we  perish?  And  he  arose,  and  rebuked  the 
wind,  and  said  unto  the  sea,  Peace,  be  still.  And  the  wind  ceased,  and 
there  was  a  great  calm.  And  he  said  unto  them,  Why  are  \e  so  fearful? 
how  is  it  that  ye  have  no  faith?  And  they  feared  exceedingly,  and  said 
one  to  another,  What  manner  of  man  is  this,  that  even  the  winds  and  the 
sea  obey  him? 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  the  Priest  or  the  Deacon  saith  the  Augmented  Litany. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  beseech 
thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

And  the  rest  {see  page  90).     To  this  he  addeth: 

Do  thou,  who  of  old  didst  rebuke  the  winds  and  the  sea,  and  unto 
the  ship  tossed  by  the  waves  didst  give  calm  by  thy  word ;  and  didst 
render  thy  disciples  untroubled:  Regard  now,  also,  O  Merciful  One, 
the  prayers  of  thy  servant  who  diligently  worshippeth  {servants  who 
diligently  worship)  thee,  and  bless  his  {her,  their)  voyage,  granting 
unto  him  {her,  them)  a  calm,  peaceful  and  untroubled  journey,  we 
beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy,  fy 

O  Saviour,  who  didst  walk  upon  the  water  as  upon  dry  land,  and 
didst  deliver  Peter  from  drowning  by  thy  right  hand  almighty:  De- 
liver thou,  O  Lord,  him  {her)  who  in  faith  hath  {those  who  in  faith 
have)  recourse  unto  thee,  and  is  directing  his  {her)  {are  directing 
their)  steps  to  a  journey,  from  all  calamities  and  stormy  winds; 
mercifully  granting  unto  him  {her,  them)  a  favourable  journey  and 
restoration  to  his  {her,  their)  home(s),  we  beseech  thee,  O  all-bountiful 
Lord:  hearken,  and  have  mercy,  ty 

Send  thine  Angel,  O  all-merciful  Lord,  to  accompany  him  {her, 
them)  on  the  way,  and  to  be  the  guardian  of  his  {her)  soul  and  body 
{their  souls  and  bodies),  preserving  him  {her,  them),  and  sheltering  him 
{her,  them)  from  all  enemies,  both  visible  and  invisible;  and  by  thy 
might  divine  delivering  him  {her,  them)  from  all  tribulation,  calamity 
and  necessity,  from  sickness  and  from  mortal  wounds;  and  in  due 
season  restore  thou  him  {her,  them)  again  to  his  {her)  home  {their 
homes)  in  safety:  to  the  glory  of  thine  all-holy  Name,  we  beseech 
thee,  O  omnipotent  Master:  mercifully  hearken,  and  have  mercy.  1$

And  the  Priest  maketh  the  Exclamation: 
Hear  us,  O  God,  our  Saviour,  .  .     {See  page  517.) 

And  the  Deacon  saith: 
Bowing  our  knees  and  our  heads  devoutly  unto  the  Lord,  let  us  pray 
to  the  Lord. 
Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Then,  as  all  kneel,  the  Priest,  turning  to  the  west  and  standing  at  the  door  of  the 
Church,  saith,  in  a  loud  voice,  this  Prayer: 

O  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  didst  walk  upon  the  waters 
as  upon  dry  land,  and  didst  deign  to  have  thy  holy  Disciples  and  Apostles 
as  thy  fellow- voyagers  in  the  ship;  and  didst  rebuke  the  stormy  wind, 
and  command  the  waves  of  the  sea  to  be  still:  Be  pleased  now  also  (we 
humbly  entreat  thee,  O  Saviour),  to  sail  with  this  thy  servant  {these  thy 
servants)  in  this  ship  {or  boat),  allaying  every  contrary  wind  and  tempest: 
And  raise  up  special  and  timely  winds  for  a  prosperous  voyage,  being 
thyself  ever  unto  him  {her,  them)  a  pilot,  and  a  saving,  untempestuous 
and  tranquil  haven  unto  the  same,  and  unto  his  {her,  their)  ship  {or 
boat).  And  as  thou  didst  save  Peter  from  drowning,  so  also,  in  sovereign 
wise,  deliver  thou  this  person  {these  persons)  from  all  assaults  of  enemies, 
both  visible  and  invisible,  and  from  calamity,  and  distress,  and  fear,  by 
thy  right  hand  omnipotent:  And  graciously  vouchsafe  that  he  {she,  they) 
may  return  in  peace  to  his  {her)  home  {their  homes)  in  health  and  happi- 
ness, having  accomplished  his  {her,  their)  purpose  and  good  undertaking, 
richly  bestowing  upon  all  his  {her,  their)  deeds  thy  rich  and  inexhaustible 
grace,  and  preserving  the  vessel  whole  and  unharmed.  For  thou  art  the 
Saviour,  the  Deliverer,  and  the  rich  Giver  of  all  good  things,  both 
heavenly  and  earthly,  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  taking  the  honourable  cross,  the  Priest  giveth  it  to  the  person{s)  to  kiss;  and  he 
sprinkleth  the  person{s)  with  holy  water,  saying: 

May  the  Lord  bless  thee  {you)  out  of  Zion ;  and  so  shalt  thou  {shall  ye) 
behold  the  good  things  of  Jerusalem  all  the  days  of  thy  {your)  life:  and 
may  he  direct  thy  {your)  journey  in  peace,  unto  the  glory  of  his  holy 
Name.     Amen. 

And  immediately  he  pronounceth  the  usual  Benediction  for  the  day. 


THE  OFFICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  AT  THE  NEW 

YEAR 

After  the  Liturgy  is  ended,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Bless,  Master. 

Priest.  Blessed  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Reader.  O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us 
worship  and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 
O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down  before  him.     {Three  reverences.) 

And  Psalm  lxv. 

Thou,  O  God,  art  praised  in  Zion;  and  unto  thee  shall  the  vow  be 
performed  in  Jerusalem.  Thou  that  hearest  the  prayer,  unto  thee  shall 
all  flesh  come.  My  misdeeds  prevail  against  me:  O  be  thou  merciful 
unto  our  sins.  Blessed  is  the  man  whom  thou  choosest,  and  receivest 
unto  thee:  he  shall  dwell  in  thy  court,  and  shall  be  satisfied  with  the 
pleasures  of  thy  house,  even  of  thy  holy  temple.  Thou  shalt  show  us 
wonderful  things  in  thy  righteousness,  O  God  of  our  salvation;  thou 
that  art  the  hope  of  the  ends  of  the  earth,  and  of  them  that  remain  in  the 
broad  sea.  Who  in  his  strength  setteth  fast  the  mountains,  and  is  girded 
about  with  power  Who  stilleth  the  raging  of  the  sea,  and  the  noise  of 
his  waves,  and  the  madness  of  the  people.  They  also  that  dwell  in  the 
uttermost  parts  of  the  earth  shall  be  afraid  at  thy  tokens,  thou  that 
makest  the  out-goings  of  the  morning  and  evening  to  praise  thee.  Thou 
visitest  the  earth  and  blessest  it;  thou  makest  it  very  plenteous.  The 
.river  of  God  is  full  of  water:  thou  preparest  their  corn,  for  so  thou  pro- 
videst  for  the  earth.  Thou  waterest  her  furrows;  thou  sendest  rain  into 
the  little  valleys  thereof;  thou  makest  it  soft  with  the  drops  of  rain,  and 
blessest  the  increase  of  it.  Thou  crownest  the  year  with  thy  goodness; 
and  thy  clouds  drop  fatness.  They  shall  drop  upon  the  dwellings  of  the 
wilderness,  and  the  little  hills  shall  rejoice  on  every  side.  The  folds  shall 
be  full  of  sheep;  the  valleys  also  shall  stand  so  thick  with  corn,  that  they 
shall  laugh  and  sing. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  Amen.  Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.  Glory 
to  thee,  O  God.     {Thrice.) 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  following  Litany: 
In  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.

grace. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Calling  to  remembrance  our  most  holy,  all-undeflled,  most  blessed  and 
glorious  Lady,  the  Birth-giver  of  God  and  ever-virgin  Mary,  with  all  the 
Saints,  let  us  commend  ourselves,  and  each  other,  and  all  our  life  unto 
Christ  our  God.

Exclamation. 

Priest.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all  glory,  honour  and  worship,  to  the 
Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then:  God  is  the  Lord,  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us.  Blessed  is 
he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Verse  (Stikh)  I :  O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious,  be- 
cause his  mercy  endureth  forever. 

Verse  2 :  All  the  nations  compassed  me  about,  but  in  the  Name  of  the

our  eyes. 

And  the  following  Hymns,  in  Tone  IV.: 

We,  thine  unworthy  servants,  O  Lord,  grateful  for  thy  great  benefits 
which  thou  hast  showed  upon  us,  glorifying  thee  do  praise,  bless,  give 
thanks,  sing  and  magnify  thy  loving-kindness,  and  cry  aloud  unto  thee 
in  humble  submissiveness :  O  our  Benefactor  and  our  Saviour,  glory  to 
thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  (Tone 
III.) 

O  Master,  who  hast  freely  vouchsafed  thy  benefits  and  gifts  unto  thine 
unprofitable  servants,  zealously  resorting  unto  thee,  we  offer  unto  thee 
thanksgiving  according  to  our  strength,  and  glorifying  thee  as  our  Bene- 
factor and  our  Creator,  we  cry  aloud :  Glory  to  thee,  O  God  most  bountiful.

Reader  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Fourth  Tone.  I  will  sing 
praises  unto  the  Lord  because  he  hath  dealt  so  lovingly  with  me,  yea,  I 
will  praise  the  Name  of  the  Lord  Most  Highest. 

Verse  (Stikh):  My  heart  shall  rejoice  in  thy  salvation. 

Then  he  readeth  the  Epistle. 

(1  Timothy  ii.  1-6.)  My  son  Timothy,  I  exhort  thee,  that,  first  of  all, 
supplications,  prayers,  intercessions,  and  giving  of  thanks  be  made  for 
all  men.  For  kings  and  for  all  that  are  in  authority;  that  we  may  lead 
a  quiet  and  peaceable  life  in  all  godliness  and  honesty.  For  this  is  good 
and  acceptable  in  the  sight  of  God  our  Saviour;  who  will  have  all  men 
to  be  saved,  and  to  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  truth.  For  there  is 
one  God  and  one  mediator  between  God  and  men,  the  man  Jesus  Christ; 
who  gave  himself  a  ransom  for  all.  To  him  be  honour  and  glory  unto 
ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee. 

Reader.  And  to  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  Alleluia,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

Then  the  Deacon: 
And  that  he  will  graciously  vouchsafe  unto  us  to  hear  his  Holy  Gospel, 
let  us  pray  to  the  Lord  God. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  believers!     Let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  Luke. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

And  immediately  the  Priest  readeth  the  Gospel. 

{Luke  iv.  16-22.)  Then  came  Jesus  to  Nazareth,  where  he  had  been 
brought  up:  and  as  his  custom  was,  he  went  into  the  synagogue  on  the 
Sabbath  day,  and  stood  up  for  to  read.  And  there  was  delivered  unto 
him  the  book  of  the  prophet  Esaias.  And  when  he  had  opened  the  book, 
he  found  the  place  where  it  was  written,  The  spirit  of  the  Lord  is  upon 
me,  because  he  hath  anointed  me  to  preach  the  gospel  to  the  poor;  he 
hath  sent  me  to  heal  the  broken-hearted,  to  preach  deliverance  to  the 
captives,  and  recovering  of  sight  to  the  blind,  to  set  at  liberty  them  that 
are  bruised,  to  preach  the  acceptable  year  of  the  Lord.  And  he  closed 
the  book,  and  he  gave  it  again  to  the  minister,  and  sat  down.  And  the 
eyes  of  all  them  that  were  in  the  synagogue  were  fastened  on  him.  And 
he  began  to  say  unto  them,  This  day  is  this  scripture  fulfilled  in  your  ears. 
And  all  bare  him  witness,  and  wondered  at  the  gracious  words  which 
proceeded  out  of  his  mouth. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord ;  glory  to  thee.

it  into  the  hand  of  the  right  believers,  we  beseech  thee,  O  all-powerful

O  Master,  Lord  our  God,  the  Source  of  life  and  of  immortality,  the 
Author  of  all  created  things  both  visible  and  invisible,  who  hast  placed 
all  seasons  and  years  in  thy  power,  and  dost  direct  all  things  with  thy 
most-wise  and  all-gracious  providence:  We  thank  thee  for  thy  bounties,

therance in  all  things.  Deliver  thy  holy  Church,  this  city,  and  all  cities

tranquillity;  and  grant  that  we  may  always  offer  thanksgiving  unto  thee, 
the  Father  who  is  from  everlasting,  together  with  thine  Only-begotten 
Son,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  God  glorified

of  St.  Ambrose,  Bishop  of  Milan: 

We  praise  thee,  O  God;  we  acknowledge  thee  to  be  the  Lord.  All  the 
earth  doth  worship  thee,  the  Father  everlasting.  To  thee  all  Angels 
cry  aloud;  the  Heavens,  and  all  the  Powers  therein.  To  thee  Cherubim 
and  Seraphim  continually  do  cry,  Holy,  Holy,  Holy,  Lord  God  of  Sabaoth ; 
heaven  and  earth  are  full  of  the  Majesty  of  thy  Glory.  The  glorious 
company  of  the  Apostles  praise  thee.  The  goodly  fellowship  of  the 
Prophets  praise  thee.  The  noble  army  of  Martyrs  praise  thee.  The 
holy  Church  throughout  all  the  world  doth  acknowledge  thee;  the  Father 


54o        THE  OFFICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  AT  THE  NEW  YEAR 

of  an  infinite  Majesty;  thine  adorable,  true,  and  only  Son;  also  the  Holy 
Ghost,  the  Comforter.  Thou  art  the  King  of  Glory,  O  Christ.  Thou 
art  the  everlasting  Son  of  the  Father.  When  thou  tookest  upon  thee 
to  deliver  man,  thou  didst  humble  thyself  to  be  born  of  a  Virgin.  When 
thou  hadst  overcome  the  sharpness  of  death,  thou  didst  open  the  King- 
dom of  Heaven  to  all  believers.  Thou  sittest  at  the  right  hand  of  God, 
in  the  glory  of  the  Father.  We  believe  that  thou  shalt  come  to  be  our 
Judge.  We  therefore  pray  thee,  help  thy  servants,  whom  thou  hast 
redeemed  with  thy  precious  blood.  Make  them  to  be  numbered  with 
thy  Saints,  in  glory  everlasting.  O  Lord,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine 
heritage.  Govern  them,  and  lift  them  up  forever.  Day  by  day  we  mag- 
nify thee;  and  we  worship  thy  Name,  ever,  world  without  end.  Vouch- 
safe, O  Lord,  to  keep  us  this  day  without  sin.  O  Lord,  have  mercy  upon 
us,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  let  thy  mercy  be  upon  us,  as  our  trust 
is  in  thee.     O  Lord,  in  thee  have  I  trusted ;  let  me  never  be  confounded. 

And  when  it  is  finished,  the  Deacon  saith: 

Wisdom ! 

Priest.  O  most  holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  save  us. 

Choir.  More  honourable  than  the  Cherubim,  and  beyond  compare 
more  glorious  than  the  Seraphim,  thou  who  without  defilement  barest 
God  the  Word,  true  Birth-giver  of  God,  we  magnify  thee. 

Priest.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ-God,  our  hope;  glory  to  thee. 

Choir.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.)     Bless. 

Priest.  May  Christ,  our  true  God,  who  for  our  salvation  condescended 
to  be  circumcised  in  the  flesh,  through  the  prayers  of  his  most  holy 
Mother,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch 
as  he  is  gracious  and  loveth  mankind. 

The  Deacon  then  proclaimeth: 
Grant,  O  Lord,  a  prosperous  and  peaceful  life,  health  and  safety,  and 
furtherance  in  all  things,  as  also  conquest  and  victory  over  his  enemies, 
unto  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  and  to  all  the  Authorities  (and  to 
the  Ruler  of  the  Land,  mentioning  him  by  his  title,  if  it  be  in  a  foreign  country) : 
and  preserve  them  for  many  years. 

And  the  Choir  singeth:  Many  years.

and  take  their  stand  in  the  middle  of  the  Temple;  and  making  three  reverences,  they 
begin: 

Deacon.  Bless,  Father. 

Priest.  Glory  to  the  Holy,  Consubstantial,  Life-giving  and  Undivided 
Trinity  always,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. Choir.  Amen. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come,  and 
take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain ;  and  save  our 
souls,  O  Good  One. 

Reader.  O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy 
upon  us.     {Thrice,  and  three  reverences.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our  sins. 
O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our 
infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.) 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  kingdom 
come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day 
our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those  who 
trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver  us 
from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages. 

Reader.  Amen.  Lord,  have  mercy.  {Twelve  times.)  Glory  .  now, 
and  ever  .  . 

O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.     O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall 

down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.     O  come,  let  us  worship  and 

fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.     O  come,  let  us 

worship  and  fall  down  before  him.     {Three  reverences.)

Verse  3:  I  shall  not  die  but  live,  and  declare  the  works  of  the  Lord. 
Verse  4:  The  stone  which  the  builders  rejected,  the  same  is  become  the 
head  of  the  corner.     This  is  the  Lord's  doing,  and  it  is  marvellous  in  our 

eyes. 

Then  the  following  shall  be  sung,  in  Tone  VI.: 

Choir  I.  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace.  To-day  doth 
Bethlehem  receive  him  who  sitteth  with  the  Father  forever  enthroned. 
To-day  Angels  majestically  magnify  the  Child  who  is  born.  Glory  be  to 
God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  toward  men. 

Choir  II.  {Tone  II.)  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth  peace. 
Behold,  the  Lamb  of  Bethlehem  hath  crushed  under  his  feet  the  lion  and 
the  adder  for  us,  and  hath  given  peace  unto  his  world.  Wherefore,  unto 
the  Child  who  is  the  Sovereign  Lord  of  the  universe,  do  we,  together  with 
the  Angels,  offer  glorious  praise.  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  and  on  earth 
peace,  good  will  toward  men. 

Choir  I.  {Tone  I.)  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit. 

O  Lord,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance,  granting  to  our 
most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  victory  over  all  adversaries,  and  by  thy 
Cross  preserving  thine  Estate. 

Now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  {Bogoroditcheri).     Tone  I. 

Let  us  sing  the  praises  of  Mary,  Virgin,  Door  of  heaven,  Glory  of  all  the 
world,  sprung  forth  from  man,  who  also  bare  the  Lord;  the  Song  of  the 
Bodiless  Powers,  and  the  Enriching  of  the  faithful.  For  she  revealed 
herself  as  Heaven  and  the  Temple  of  the  Godhead.  She  destroyed  the 
bulwarks  of  enmity,  and  ushered  in  peace,  and  threw  open  the  kingdom. 
Wherefore,  in  that  we  possess  this  confirmation  of  our  faith,  we  have  a 
Defender,  even  the  Lord  who  was  born  of  her.  Be  bold,  therefore,  ye 
people  of  God,  be  bold,  for  he,  the  AU-Powerful,  will  vanquish  your  foes. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all.

Principal  Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Deacon  or  Reader.  The  Lesson  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah. 

Principal  Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

{Isaiah  xiv.  13-18;  24-28.)  Thus  saith  the  Lord  to  the  King  of  Baby- 
Ion:  For  thou  hast  said  in  thy  heart,  I  will  ascend  into  heaven,  I  will  exalt 
my  throne  above  the  stars  of  God :  I  will  sit  also  upon  the  mount  of  the 
congregation,  in  the  sides  of  the  north:  I  will  ascend  above  the  heights  of 
the  clouds;  I  will  be  like  the  Most  High.  Yet  thou  shalt  be  brought  down 
to  hell,  to  the  sides  of  the  pit.     They  that  see  thee  shall  narrowly  look

upon  thee,  and  consider  thee,  saying,  Is  this  the  man  that  made  the  earth 
to  tremble,  that  did  shake  kingdoms:  that  made  the  world  as  a  wilderness, 
and  destroyed  the  cities  thereof:  that  opened  not  the  house  of  his  prison- 
ers? The  Lord  of  hosts  hath  sworn,  saying,  Surely  as  I  have  thought,  so 
shall  it  come  to  pass;  and  as  I  have  purposed,  so  shall  it  stand:  that  I  will 
break  the  Assyrian  in  my  land,  and  upon  my  mountains  tread  him  under 
foot:  then  shall  his  yoke  depart  from  off  them,  and  his  burden  depart  from 
off  their  shoulders.  This  is  the  purpose  that  is  purposed  upon  the  whole 
earth:  and  this  is  the  hand  that  is  stretched  out  upon  all  the  nations.  For 
the  Lord  of  hosts  hath  purposed,  and  who  shall  disannul  it?  and  his  hand 
is  stretched  out,  and  who  shall  turn  it  back? 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you. 

Reader.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  the  Seventh  Tone.  Who  is  so 
great  a  God  as  our  God?  Thou  art  God,  and  doest  wonders. 

Verse  (Slikh)   1 :  Thou  hast  declared  thy  power  among  the  nations. 

Verse  2 :  I  said :  To-day  have  I  begotten  thee.  These  are  the  rewards 
of  the  right  hand  of  the  Most  High. 

Verse  3:  I  have  remembered  the  works  of  the  Lord;  for  I  recall  thy 
marvels  from  the  beginning. 

And  again:  Who  is  so  great  a  God  as  our  God?  Thou  art  God,  and 
doest  wonders. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  The  Lesson  irom  the  Epistle  of  the  holy  Apostle  Paul  to  the 
Hebrews. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Reader.  (Heb.  xi.  32-35;  xii.  1-2.)  Brethren:  What  shall  I  say  more? 
for  the  time  would  fail  me  to  tell  of  Gedeon,  and  of  Barak,  and  of  Samson, 
and  of  Jephthae,  of  David  also,  and  Samuel,  and  of  the  prophets:  who 
through  faith  subdued  kingdoms,  wrought  righteousness,  obtained  prom- 
ises, stopped  the  mouths  of  lions,  quenched  the  violence  of  fire,  escaped 
the  edge  of  the  sword,  out  of  weakness  were  made  strong,  waxed  valiant  in 
fight,  turned  to  flight  the  armies  of  the  aliens.  Wherefore,  seeing  we  also 
are  compassed  about  with  so  great  a  cloud  of  witnesses,  let  us  lay  aside 
every  weight,  and  the  sin  which  doth  so  easily  beset  us,  and  let  us  run  with 
patience  the  race  that  is  set  before  us,  looking  unto  Jesus  the  author  and 
finisher  of  our  faith. 

Priest.  Peace  be  unto  thee. 

Reader.  And  to  thy  spirit. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  Alleluia.  {Tone  VII.)  The  Lord  shall  give  strength  unto  his 
people:  the  Lord  shall  give  his  people  the  blessing  of  peace. 


546      OFFICE  OF  PRAISE  AND  THANKSGIVING  AT  CHRISTMAS 

Deacon.  That  he  will  mercifully  vouchsafe  unto  us  to  hear  his  Holy 
Gospel,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord  God. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy-     {Thrice.) 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  believers;  let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel! 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. 

People.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Priest.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  Matthew. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  {Matt.  xxiv.  6-8,  21-23.)  Jesus  said  unto  his  disciples:  Ye  shall 
hear  of  wars,  and  rumours  of  wars:  see  that  ye  be  not  troubled :  for  all  these 
things  must  come  to  pass,  but  the  end  is  not  yet.  For  nation  shall  rise 
against  nation,  and  kingdom  against  kingdom:  and  there  shall  be  famines, 
and  pestilences,  and  earthquakes  in  divers  places.  For  then  shall  be  great 
tribulation,  such  as  was  not  since  the  beginning  of  the  world  to  this  time, 
no,  nor  ever  shall  be.  And  except  those  days  should  be  shortened,  there 
should  no  flesh  be  saved :  but  for  the  elect's  sake  those  days  shall  be  short- 
ened. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Then  straightway  the  Deacon  reciteth  this  Litany: 

Let  us  all  say,  with  all  our  soul  and  with  all  our  mind  let  us  say, 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

O  Lord  Almighty,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  we  beseech  thee:  hearken,  and 
have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great  mercy,  we  be- 
seech thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.    1$ 

Again  we  pray  for  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  for  his  might, 
victory,  maintenance,  peace,  health,  salvation;  and  that  the  Lord  our 
God  will  abundantly  aid  and  prosper  him  in  all  things,  and  subdue 
under  his  feet  every  foe  and  adversary.    fy 

Again  we  pray  {for  the  Ruler  of  the  Land,  by  his  title,  if  it  be  in  a  foreign 
country) .    fy 

Again  we  pray  for  our  Most  Holy  Synod  {or  Patriarch);  for  our 
Bishop  {or  Archbishop,  or  Metropolitan),  N.,  of  N.;  and  for  all  our 
brethren  in  Christ.    1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  all  their  Christ-loving  Army  and  Navy.   1$ 

Furthermore  we  pray  that  our  Lord  and  Saviour  will  accept  the 
confession  and  thanksgiving  of  us,  his  unworthy  servants:  for  he  hath 
not  dealt  with  us  according  to  our  sins,  neither  rewarded  us  accord- 
ing to  our  iniquities.  But  in  the  hour  of  trial  also,  which  came  upon 
all  the  world,  he  delivered  us;  and  when  our  enemies  compassed  us 
round  about,  he  revealed  unto  us  his  salvation,    fy

Abraham,  after  that  he  had  overthrown  four  kings,  and  had  set  free 
the  captives;  and  when  Pharaoh  together  with  his  host  was  engulfed 
in  the  Red  Sea,  didst  give  heed  from  the  cloudy  pillar  to  the  Song  of 
Moses  and  Miriam,  to  the  trumpets  also  and  dancing;  and  didst  teach 
David,  the  king  after  thine  own  heart,  to  write  Psalms  of  triumph 
unto  thee  alone:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord  of  Hosts,  now,  also,  in  that 
thou  hast  overcome  him  who  was  an  enemy  and  alien  from  thee,  and 
hast  saved  thine  Anointed,  and  glorified  the  majesty  of  Russia,  and 
established  the  Church,  as  out  of  the  mouths  of  babes  make  the 
praises  out  of  the  mouths  of  all  us  acceptable  unto  thee;  receive  into 
thy  salvation  as  a  burnt-offering  our  souls  which  had  vanished  away. 
Hearken  to  the  voice  of  our  rejoicing;  and,  as  of  old,  we  fervently  be- 
seech thee  show  mercy  upon  us  in  the  day  of  trouble,    fy 

Furthermore  we  pray  for  our  victorious  chieftains  and  warriors, 
and  for  all  those  zealous  defenders  of  the  Faith  and  of  righteousness, 
who  have  laid  down  their  lives  for  their  brethren  in  the  year  of  tribu- 
lation :  that  the  King  of  Glory  will  recompense  them,  in  the  day  of  his 
just  requiting,  with  life  everlasting  and  the  crown  which  fadeth  not 
away;  and  that  he  will  confirm  us  all  in  their  spirit,  and  in  faith  and 
concord.    Ц 

Hear  us,  O  God  our  Saviour,  the  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the  earth,  and  of 
those  who  are  far  off  upon  the  seas;  and  show  mercy,  show  mercy,  O  Mas- 
ter, upon  us  sinners,  and  be  merciful  unto  us. 

For  thou  art  a  merciful  God  who  lovest  mankind,  and  unto  thee  we 
ascribe  glory,  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now, 
and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend,  and  in  lowliness  of  heart  bowing  the  knees  of  our 
souls  and  bodies,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Then  the  Priest,  kneeling  down  (as  doth  also  the  whole  congregation),  shall  recite, 
aloud,  with  all  fervour  and  emotion,  the  following  Prayer: 

O  God,  great  and  inscrutable,  O  Father,  who  hast  no  beginning,  O  Son 
who  likewise  hast  no  beginning,  and  Spirit  who  equally  existest  from  ever- 
lasting; who  bringest  into  being  that  which  had  no  being,  and  savest  those 
who  are  ready  to  perish,  and  givest  life  to  the  dead,  working  after  thy  will 
among  the  heavenly  hosts,  and  in  .the  dwellings  of  earth,  and  by  thy 
marvellous  Providence  directing  all  things!  Incline  thine  ear  from  thy 
holy  place  on  high,  and  accept  from  us,  thy  humble  and  unworthy  serv- 
ants, upon  whom  thou  hast  manifested  thy  great  salvation  from  calamity 
and  utter  destruction,  these  prayers  of  gratitude,  praise  and  thanksgiving 
which  we  offer  unto  thee  with  our  heart,  and  with  our  lips.  For  not  ac- 
cording to  our  transgressions  hast  thou  dealt  with  us,  O  Lord,  neither  re- 
warded us  according  to  our  iniquities.     Thou  didst  say  of  old  unto  the 


548     OFFICE  OF  PRAISE  AND  THANKSGIVING  AT  CHRISTMAS 

Children  of  Israel,  that  if  they  would  not  hearken  unto  thy  voice  to  keep 
and  to  do  all  thy  commandments,  thou  wouldest  send  upon  them  the 
heathen  shameless  of  countenance,  who  should  crush  them  in  their  cities, 
until  also  their  walls  should  be  cast  down;  and  we  have  seen  how  this  ter- 
rible word  came  upon  us,  and  upon  our  fathers.  Yet  fearing  not  thy 
warning,  and  despising  thy  compassion,  we  departed  from  the  way  of  thy 
righteousness,  and  walked  after  the  lusts  of  our  own  hearts,  and  strove  not 
to  have  in  our  hearts  thee,  the  God  of  minds  and  of  hearts;  and  heeding 
not  the  traditions  of  our  fathers,  we  angered  thee  through  strangers.  For 
which  cause,  also,  like  unto  the  Children  of  Israel  of  old,  a  fierce  host  en- 
compassed us  round  about,  and  those  in  whose  customs  we  were  zealous, 
these  same  turbulent  and  brutal-natured  ones  have  we  had  as  our  ene- 
mies. But  thou,  O  Lord  God,  who  art  pitiful  and  merciful,  long-suffering 
and  rich  in  loving-kindness,  and  faithful,  keeping  righteousness  and  show- 
ing mercy  unto  thousands,  taking  away  iniquities  and  transgressions,  after 
that  thou  hadst  departed  from  us  for  a  little  space,  with  great  mercy  hast 
been  merciful  unto  us:  and  having  visited  our  wrong-doings  with  thy  rod, 
like  as  a  father  is  bountiful  unto  his  children,  even  so  hast  thou  been 
bountiful  unto  us.  For  thou  hast  regarded  our  affliction  and  the  wasting 
away  of  the  Imperial  City,  wherein,  from  ancient  days,  thy  Name  hath 
been  invoked,  and  our  supplications  which,  trusting  not  in  our  own  righte- 
ousness but  in  thy  great  bounties,  we  have  laid  at  thy  feet,  O  Lord.  And 
thou  hast  given  us  the  ascendency  over  our  ungodly  adversaries;  thou 
hast  crowned  our  most  God-fearing  Emperor,  Alexander  Pavlovitch,  with 
the  panoply  of  thy  favour,  that  vanishing  thine  enemies  might  vanish  be- 
fore the  face  of  thy  Christ  even  as  the  smoke,  and  that  they  who  love  thee 
might  shine  even  as  the  rising  sun  in  his  splendour.  We  have  seen,  O 
Lord,  we  have  seen,  and  all  nations  have  seen  in  us,  that  thou  art  God, 
and  that  there  is  none  beside  thee.  Thou  slayest  and  makest  alive;  thou 
smitest  and  healest,  and  there  is  none  who  shall  wrest  us  out  of  thy  hand. 
Therefore  is  our  heart  fixed  upon  our  Lord,  who  hath  exalted  our  horn  in 
our  God,  and  we  have  rejoiced  in  thy  salvation.  We  thank  thee,  O  Lord, 
that  thou  hast  chastised  us  for  a  little  space,  but  hast  not  given  us  over 
unto  death  forever.  Enable  us,  O  Lord,  unceasingly  and  steadfastly  to 
bear  within  us  the  memory  of  this,  thy  glorious  visitation,  unto  the  estab- 
lishment in  us  of  filial  fear,  together  with  love  and  faith  in  thee.  And 
vouchsafe  that,  compassed  about  by.  thy  protection,  we  may  ever  hence- 
forth, as  this  day,  praise  and  magnify  thy  holy  Name.  Confirm  thy  good 
will  upon  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  and  may  thy  blessed  spirit 
abide  upon  him  evermore.  Grant  in  his  godly  dominion :  To  the  Pastors, 
holiness;  to  the  Rulers,  judgment  and  uprightness;  to  the  People,  peace 
and  quietness;  to  the  law,  strength;  and  to  the  faith,  advancement.  O 
most  merciful  Lord!  satisfy  with  thy  mercy  those  who  have  known  thee; 
and  unto  those  who  are  not  seeking  thee,  reveal  thou  thyself;  and  turn 


OFFICE  OF  PRAISE  AND  THANKSGIVING  AT  CHRISTMAS    549 

thou  also  the  hearts  of  our  enemies  unto  thee ;  and  be  thou  known  unto  all 
tribes  and  nations  in  thine  only  true  Christ.     And  let  all  the  peoples,  from 
the  rising  of  the  sun  even  unto  the  going  down  of  the  same,  cry  aloud  with 
praise  unto  thee,  in  everv  tongue,  with  the  voice  of  rejoicing. 
Then  he  proclaimeth,  with  a  loud  voice: 

Glory  to  thee,  O  God,  Saviour  of  all,  unto  ages  of  ages! 

Choir.  Amen. 

Then  is  sung  the  Great  Hymn  of  Praise  {The  Gloria  in  Excelsis.     See  page  34), 
or  We  praise  thee,  O  God ;     .     (See  page  539.) 

And  the  following  Benediction  is  pronounced: 
May  he  who,  like  a  lamb,  did  lie  in  the  manger  at  Bethlehem,  who  also, 
like  a  lion,  doth  overthrow  the  power  of  the  enemy  and  doth  lead  his  own 
faithful  sheep  in  the  way  of  righteousness  and  salvation,  and  doth  guide 
and  feed  the  world,  Christ  our  true  God  and  Saviour;  through  the  inter- 
cessions of  his  most  holy  Mother,  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have  mercy  upon 
us  and  save  us,  in  that  he  is  gracious  and  loveth  mankind. 

Then  the  Deacon  proclaimeth: 

Grant,  O  Lord,  a  prosperous  and  peaceful  life,  health  and  safety,  and 
furtherance  in  all  things,  as  also  conquest  and  victory  over  his  enemies, 
unto  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.  (and  to  the  Ruler  of  the  Land,  men- 
tioning him  by  his  title,  if  it  be  in  a  foreign  country) :  and  preserve  them  for 
many  years. 

Choir.  Many  years. 

Deacon.  Unto  thy  departed  servant,  our  most  God-fearing  Sovereign, 
the  Emperor  Alexander  the  First,  grant  repose  eternal  in  the  assumption 
of  the  blessed,  O  Lord;  and  make  his  memory  to  be  eternal. 

Choir.  Memory  eternal !     (Thrice.) 

To  the  victorious,  Christ-loving  Army  of  Russia,  Many  years. 

Choir.  Many  years.     (Thrice.) 

And  when  the  Many  years  hath  been  sung,  the  bells  begin  to  peal,  and  so  continue.

Priest.  Blessed  is  the  kingdom  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir    Amen. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  who  art  in  all  places 
and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of  good  things  and  Giver  of  life:  Come, 
and  take  up  thine  abode  in  us,  and  cleanse  us  from  every  stain;  and  save 
our  souls,  O  Good  One. 

O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon 
us.     (Thrice,  and  three  reverences.) 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  most  Holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us.  O  Lord,  wash  away  our 
sins.  O  Master,  pardon  our  transgressions.  O  Holy  One,  visit  and  heal 
our  infirmities,  for  thy  Name's  sake. 

Lord,  have  mercy      (Thrice.) 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  Hallowed  be  thy  Name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive 
those  who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But 
deliver  us  from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of 
the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and 
unto  ages  of  ages. 

Choir.  Amen.     Lord,  have  mercy.     (Twelve  times.) 

Priest.  O  come,  let  us  worship  God  our  King.  O  come,  let  us  worship 
and  fall  down  before  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God.  O  come,  let  us 
worship  and  fall  down  before  the  Very  Christ,  our  King  and  our  God. 
O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down  before  him.     (Three  reverences.) 

Then  the  Choir  chanteth  the  Imperial  Psalm: 

Psalm  xxi. 

The  King  shall  rejoice  in  thy  strength,  O  Lord;  exceeding  glad  shall  he 
be  of  thy  salvation.  Thou  hast  given  him  his  heart's  desire,  and  hast  not 
denied  him  the  request  of  his  lips.  For  thou  shalt  prevent  him  with  the 
blessings  of  goodness,  and  shalt  set  a  crown  of  pure  gold  upon  his  head. 


THE  GREAT  OFFICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  (TE  DEUM)  551 

He  asked  life  of  thee,  and  thou  gavest  him  a  long  life,  even  for  ever  and 
ever.  His  honour  is  great  in  thy  salvation :  glory  and  great  worship  shalt 
thou  lay  upon  him.  For  thou  shalt  give  him  everlasting  felicity,  and 
make  him  glad  with  the  joy  of  thy  countenance.  And  why?  Because 
the  King  putteth  his  trust  in  the  Lord;  and  in  the  mercy  of  the  Most 
Highest  he  shall  not  miscarry.  All  thine  enemies  shall  feel  thine  hand: 
thy  right  hand  shall  find  out  them  that  hate  thee.  Thou  shalt  make  them 
like  a  fiery  oven  in  the  time  of  thy  wrath ;  the  Lord  shall  destroy  them  in 
his  displeasure,  and  the  fire  shall  consume  them.  Their  fruit  shalt  thou 
root  out  of  the  earth,  and  their  seed  from  among  the  children  of  men. 
For  they  intended  mischief  against  thee,  and  imagined  such  a  device  as 
they  are  not  able  to  perform.  Therefore  shalt  thou  put  them  to  flight, 
and  the  strings  of  thy  bow  shalt  thou  make  ready  against  the  face  of 
them.  Be  thou  exalted,  O  Lord,  in  thine  own  strength:  so  will  we  sing 
and  praise  thy  power. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.     Glory  to  thee,  O  God.     (Thrice.) 

Then  the  Deacon  saith  the  Litany:

Then:  God  is  the  Lord,  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us.  Blessed  is 
he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Verse  (Stikh)  i:  O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious;  be-

O  Lord,  save  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance,  granting  to  the

Reader.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  in  Tone  IV.:  The  King  shall  rejoice  in  thy 
strength,  O  Lord;  exceeding  glad  shall  he  be  of  thy  salvation. 

Verse  (Stikh):  Thou  hast  given  him  his  heart's  desire,  and  hast  not 
denied  him  the  request  of  his  lips. 

Deacon.  Wisdom! 

Reader.  The  Lesson  from  the  Epistle  of  the  holy  Apostle  Paul  to  the 
Romans. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Reader.  (Rom.  xiii.  1-8.)  Brethren:  Let  every  soul  be  subject  unto  the 
higher  powers.  For  there  is  no  power  but  of  God :  the  powers  that  be  are 
ordained  of  God.  Whosoever,  therefore,  resisteth  the  power  resisteth  the 
ordinance  of  God :  and  they  that  resist  shall  receive  to  themselves  damna- 
tion. For  rulers  are  not  a  terror  to  good  works,  but  to  the  evil.  Wilt 
thou  then  not  be  afraid  of  the  power?  do  that  which  is  good,  and  thou 
shalt  have  praise  of  the  same.  For  he  is  the  minister  of  God  to  thee  for 
good.  But  if  thou  do  that  which  is  evil,  be  afraid;  for  he  beareth  not  the 
sword  in  vain:  for  he  is  the  minister  of  God,  a  revenger  to  execute  wrath 
upon  him  that  doeth  evil.  Wherefore  ye  must  needs  be  subject,  not  only 
for  wrath,  but  also  for  conscience  sake.  For  this  cause  pay  ye  tribute 
also:  for  they  are  God's  ministers,  attending  continually  upon  this  very 
thing.  Render  therefore  to  all  their  dues:  tribute  to  whom  tribute  is  due; 
custom  to  whom  custom;  fear  to  whom  fear;  honour  to  whom  honour. 
Owe  no  man  anything,  but  to  love  one  another:  for  he  that  loveth  another 
hath  fulfilled  the  law. 

Alleluia.     (Thrice.) 

Deacon.  Wisdom,  O  believers!     Let  us  listen  to  the  Holy  Gospel. 

Priest.  Peace  be  with  you  all. ^Choir.  And  with  thy  spirit. 

Priest.  The  Lesson  from  the  holy  Gospel  of  Matthew. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Deacon.  Let  us  attend. 

Priest.  (Matt.  xxii.  15-22.)  Then  went  the  Pharisees  and  took  counsel 
how  they  might  entangle  him  in  his  talk.  And  they  sent  out  unto  him 
their  disciples,  with  the  Herodians,  saying,  Master,  we  know  that  thou 
art  true,  and  teachest  the  way  of  God  in  truth,  neither  carest  thou  for  any 
man;  for  thou  regardest  not  the  person  of  men.  Tell  us,  therefore,  What 
thinkest  thou?     Is  it  lawful  to  give  tribute  unto  Caesar,  or  not?     But 


554  THE  GREAT  OFFICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  (TE  DEUM) 

Jesus  perceived  their  wickedness,  and  said,  Why  tempt  ye  me,  ye  hypo- 
crites? Show  me  the  tribute  money.  And  they  brought  unto  him  a 
penny.  And  he  saith  unto  them,  Whose  is  this  image  and  superscription? 
They  say  unto  him,  Caesar's.  Then  saith  he  unto  them,  Render  therefore 
unto  Caesar  the  things  which  are  Caesar's,  and  unto  God  the  things  that 
are  God's.  When  they  had  heard  these  words,  they  marvelled,  and  left 
him,  and  went  their  way. 

Choir.  Glory  to  thee,  O  Lord;  glory  to  thee. 

Deacon.  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord,  according  to  thy  great  mercy, 
we  beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

Choir.  Lord,  have  mercy.     {Thrice.)

Deacon.  Again,  yet  again,  in  peace  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

Then  the  Bishop  or  the  Priest,  kneeling  down,  shall  recite  this  Prayer: 
O  God,  great  and  wonderful,  who  by  thine  inscrutable  goodness  and 
rich  providence  rulest  all  things;  by  whose  all-wise  yet  unsearchable 
judgments  the  life  and  sojourn  upon  earth  of  mankind  receiveth  differ- 
ent bounds:  With  gratitude  we  acknowledge  that  not  according  to  our 
iniquities  hast  thou  dealt  with  us,  neither  according  to  our  sins  hast 
thou  rewarded  us.  We  have  sinned,  O  Lord,  we  have  wrought  evil,  and 
have  rendered  ourselves  worthy  of  thine  extreme  displeasure.  But  thou, 
O  Ineffable  Loving-kindness !  art  merciful  and  long-suffering,  and  grievest 
over  the  wickedness  of  men,  O  Master.  Having  chastened  us  with  a 
brief  visitation  of  sorrow,  lo!  thou  hast  filled  our  hearts  abundantly  with 
joy  and  gladness,  in  that  thou  hast  appointed  to  rule  over  us  thy  beloved 
servant,  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.  Wherefore,  endue  thou  him 
with  wisdom,  and  direct  thou  him,  that  without  hindrance  he  may  dis- 
charge this  great  service  unto  thee.  Grant  him  reason  and  understanding, 
that  he  may  judge  thy  people  uprightly;  and  preserve  this  thine  in- 
heritance in  tranquillity,  and  without  affliction.  Make  him  victorious 
over  his  enemies;  terrible  to  evil-doers,  gracious  unto  those  who  are  good 
and  worthy  to  be  trusted.  Kindle  his  heart  unto  consideration  of  the 
needy,  unto  hospitality  to  strangers,  unto  the  defence  of  those  who  are 
assailed;  that,  guiding  those  who  are  subject  to  his  rule  in  the  v/ay  of 
truth  and  of  righteousness,  and  putting  aside  all  dissembling  and  venality, 
he  may  maintain  in  loyalty  unfeigned  all  the  people  whom  thou  hast 
committed  to  his  authority  Make  him  to  be  a  joyful  father  of  children, 
and  show  forth  thy  marvellous  mercies  upon  us.  Multiply  thou  the 
days  of  his  life  in  health  unalterable  and  prosperity  unchangeable.  Vouch- 
safe, also,  in  his  day  and  unto  us  all  peace,  tranquillity  and  prosperity, 
favourable  seasons,  abundance  of  the  fruits  of  the  earth,  and  all  things 
necessary  to  life  both  temporal  and  eternal.  O  our  Lord  all-merciful, 
the  God  of  Bounties,  and  Father  of  all  consolation!  turn  not  thy  face 
from  us,  and  put  not  to  confusion  in  our  sure  hope  us,  who,  in  firm  ex- 
pectation, make  our  supplications  unto  thee,  and  entreating  thee,  do  set 
our  trust  upon  thy  bounties.  For  thou  only  knowest  our  necessities, 
and  givest  before  we  ask,  and  confirmest  thy  gifts:  and  every  good  gift 
and  every  perfect  gift  is  from  above,  and  cometh  down  from  thee,  the 
Father  of  lights.  Unto  thee  be  glory  and  dominion,  together  with  thine 
Only-begotten  Son,  and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Choir.  Amen, 


556  THE  GREAT  OFFICE  OF  THANKSGIVING  (TE  DEUM) 

Then  immediately  is  sung  the  Great  Hymn  of  Praise:  Glory  be  to  God  on  high,  .  .  . 
(See  page  34.) 

Or,   in  its    stead,   the  Anthem    of    St.   Ambrose,   Bishop    of  Milan: 

We  praise  thee,  O  God;  we  acknowledge  thee  to  be  the  Lord.  .  .  .

May  Christ,   our  true  God,   through   the  prayers  of  his  most  holy 
Mother;  of  Saint  N.  (the  Saint  of  the  day);  and  of  all  the  Saints,  have 
mercy  upon  us  and  save  us,  forasmuch  as  he  is  gracious,  and  loveth  man- 
kind. 

And  after  the  Benediction,  the  Deacon  proclaimeth 

MANY  YEARS  (LONG  LIFE) 
To  the  Ruler  as  followeth: 
Unto  our  most  God-fearing  Ruler,  N.,  grant,  O  Lord,  length  of  days, 
a  peaceful  life,  health,  salvation  and  prosperity  in  all  things;  as  also,  con- 
quest and  victory  over  his  enemies;  and  preserve  him  for  many  years. 
Choir.  Many  years. 


PRAYERS 

AT  THE  FOUNDING  OF  A  HOUSE 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord. 

O  God  Almighty,  who  hast  made  the  heavens  with  wisdom,  and  hast 
established  the  earth  upon  its  firm  foundations,  the  Creator  and  Author 
of  all  men:  Look  upon  thy  servant,  N.,  to  whom  it  hath  seemed  good 
to  set  up  a  house  for  his  dwelling  in  the  dominion  of  thy  power,  and 
to  rear  it  by  building.  Establish  thou  the  same  upon  a  stable  rock,  and 
found  it  according  to  thy  divine  word  in  the  Gospel,  so  that  neither 
wind  nor  flood  nor  any  other  thing  shall  be  able  to  harm  it.  Graciously 
grant  that  he  may  bring  it  to  an  ending;  and  deliver  all  those  who  shall 
wish  to  dwell  therein  from  every  attack  of  the  enemy 

For  thine  is  the  dominion,  and  thine  are  the  kingdom  and  the  power 
and  the  glory,  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


WHEN  ONE  IS  ABOUT  TO  TAKE  UP  HIS  ABODE  IN  A 

NEW  HOUSE 

O  God  our  Saviour,  who  didst  deign  to  enter  under  the  roof  of  Zac- 
cheus,  unto  the  salvation  of  the  same  and  of  all  who  were  in  the  house: 
Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  keep  safe  also  from  all  harm  those  who  have 
now  desired  to  dwell  here,  and  who  together  with  us  unworthy  ones  do 
offer  unto  thee  prayers  and  supplications;  blessing  this  their  dwelling, 
and  preserving  their  life  free  from  aspersion.  For  unto  thee  are  due  all 
glory,  honour  and  worship,  together  with  thy  Father  who  hath  no  begin- 
ning, and  thine  all-holy,  and  good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 


FOR  THE  BLESSING  OF  ANY  OBJECT 

After  the  customary  beginning:  The  Thrice-Holy  (O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty). 
Then:  Our  Father,  (See  page  559.)     And  after  the  Exclamation,  the  Priest 

saith: 

Let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.     Lord,  have  mercy 

And  he  readeth  this  Prayer: 

O  Creator  and  Author  of  the  human  race,  Giver  of  spiritual  graces 
and  Bestower  of  eternal  salvation:  Do  thou,  the  same  Lord,  send  down 
thy  Holy  Spirit  with  a  blessing  from  on  high  upon  this  object;  that 


558  PRAYER  FOR  THE  BLESSING  OF  ANY  OBJECT 

fortified  by  the  might  of  heavenly  protection,  it  may  be  potent  unto 
bodily  salvation  and  succour  and  aid,  unto  all  who  shall  desire  to  make 
use  of  it,  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord.     Amen. 

He  then  sprinkleth  the  object  thrice  with  holy  water,  and  pronounceth  the  customary 
Benediction.

dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth,  As  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  As  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation;  But  deliver 
us  from  the  Evil  One: 

Priest.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  of  the 
Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.

is  he  who  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord. 

Verse  i:  O  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord,  for  he  is  gracious;  because 
his  mercy  endureth  forever. 

Verse  2:  All  the  nations  compassed  me  about,  but  in  the  Name  of 
the  Lord  have  I  driven  them  back. 

Verse  3:  I  shall  not  die  but  live,  and  declare  the  works  of  the  Lord. 

Verse  4:  The  stone  which  the  builders  rejected,  the  same  is  become 
the  head  of  the  corner.  This  is  the  Lord's  doing,  and  it  is  marvellous 
in  our  eyes.

And  if  it  be  a  Prayer  Service  to  the  Saviour,  this  Hymn: 
We  do  homage  to  thy  pure  image,  O  Good  One,  entreating  forgive- 
ness of  our  transgressions,  O  Christ  our  God:  for  of  thine  own  good  will 
thou  wast  graciously  pleased  to  ascend  the  Cross  in  the  flesh,  that  thou 
mightest  deliver  from  bondage  to  the  enemy  those  whom  thou  hadst 
fashioned.  For  which  cause  we  cry  aloud  unto  thee  with  thanksgiving: 
With  joy  hast  thou  filled  all  things,  O  our  Saviour,  in  that  thou  didst 
come  to  save  the  world. 

If  it  be  a  Prayer  Service  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God,  this  Hymn  (Bogoroditchen) : 

Unto  the  Birth-giver  of  God  let  us  sinners  and  humble  ones  now 
diligently  have  recourse;  and  let  us  fall  down  in  penitence  exclaiming, 
from  the  bottom  of  our  souls:  O  Sovereign  Lady,  help  us,  having  com- 
passion on  us!  Show  zeal,  for  we  perish  with  the  multitude  of  our  sins; 
turn  not  thy  servants  empty  away;  for  we  have  thee  as  our  only  hope. 

If  it  be  a  Prayer  Service  to  a  Saint,  the  Hymn  (Tropdr)  of  the  Saint  to  whom  appeal

One;  for  we  have  diligent  recourse  unto  thee,  the  merciful  Deliverer  of 
all  men,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 

(To  the  Birth-giver  of  God.)  Deliver  from  distress  thy  servants,  O 
Birth-giver  of  God;  for  unto  thee  in  God  we  have  recourse,  as  to  a  Wall 
Impregnable,  and  to  thy  intercession.  Look  with  benignity,  O  all- 
hymned  Birth-giver  of  God,  upon  my  dire  bodily  suffering,  and  heal 
thou  the  sickness  of  my  soul. 

(To  a  Saint.)  Pray  thou  unto  God  for  us,  O  holy  N.;  for  we  diligently 
have  recourse  unto  thee,  who  art  a  speedy  help  and  intercessor  for  our 
souls.

we  beseech  thee:  hearken,  and  have  mercy.

THE  GENERAL  PANIKHIDA  OR  REQUIEM  SERVICE  565 

And  when  the  Litany  is  finished  the  Priest,  bowing  his  head,  readeth,  secretly,  the 
Prayer: 

O  God  of  spirits,  and  of  all  flesh,  who  hast  trampled  down  Death, 
and  overthrown  the  Devil,  and  given  life  unto  thy  world:  Do  thou,  the 
same  Lord,  give  rest  to  the  souls  of  thy  departed  servants,  NN..  in 
a  place  of  brightness,  a  place  of  verdure,  a  place  of  repose,  whence 
all  sickness,  sorrow  and  sighing  have  fled  away.  Pardon  every 
transgression  which  they  have  committed,  whether  by  word,  or  deed, 
or  thought.  For  thou  art  a  good  God  and  lovest  mankind ;  because 
there  is  no  man  who  liveth  and  sinneth  not:  for  thou  only  art  with- 
out sin,  and  thy  righteousness  is  to  all  eternity,  and  thy  word  is

PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY 

COMMUNION 

(a  selection) 

I. 

A  Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

O  Master,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  the  Fountain  of  life  and  of  im- 
mortality, the  Author  of  all  creation,  both  visible  and  invisible,  the  Son 
coeternal  with  the  Father  and  equally  without  beginning,  as  is  the  Father 
which  hath  no  beginning,  who  through  thy  great  goodness  hast,  in  these 
latter  days,  endued  flesh,  and  hast  suffered  crucifixion  and  burial  for  us 
ungrateful  and  evil-natured  men,  and  hast  renewed  with  thy  blood  our 
nature  which  was  become  corrupt  through  sin :  Do  thou  accept,  O  King 
immortal,  the  repentance  of  me,  a  sinner;  incline  thine  ear  unto  me,  and 
give  heed  unto  my  words:  for  I  have  sinned,  O  Lord,  I  have  sinned  against 
heaven  and  before  thee,  and  am  not  worthy  to  look  upon  the  loftiness  of 
thy  glory.  I  have  affronted  thy  goodness,  in  that  I  have  transgressed  thy 
commandments,  and  have  not  obeyed  thy  behests.  But  thou,  O  Lord, 
inasmuch  as  thou  art  not  vengeful,  but  long-suffering  and  of  great  mercy, 
hast  not  delivered  me  over  unto  destruction  with  my  transgressions,  for 
that  thou  didst,  at  every  moment,  await  my  return.  For,  O  thou  who 
lovest  mankind,  thou  hast  said,  by  the  mouth  of  thy  prophet:  I  desire  not 
the  death  of  the  sinner,  but  that  he  should  turn  again  and  live.  Thou 
dost  not  desire,  O  Master,  to  destroy  the  work  of  thy  hands,  neither  de- 
sirest  thou  the  destruction  of  the  human  race,  but  wiliest  that  all  men 
should  be  saved,  and  should  cOme  to  the  knowledge  of  the  truth.  Where- 
fore I,  also,  albeit  I  am  unworthy  of  heaven  and  of  earth  and  of  this  tran- 
sitory life,  in  that  I  have  made  myself  all  sin,  and  have  become  a  slave  to 
sensual  things,  and  have  defiled  thine  image;  yet,  inasmuch  as  I  am  thy 
creature  and  the  work  of  thy  hands,  I  despair  not  of  my  salvation,  ac- 
cursed though  I  be,  and  I  draw  near  with  confident  hope  to  thine  illimit- 
able compassion.  Accept  me  also,  O  Lord  who  lovest  mankind,  as  thou 
didst  accept  the  sinning  woman,  the  thief,  the  publican,  the  prodigal  Son; 
take  thou  my  heavy  burden  of  sin,  O  thou  who  hast  borne  the  sins  of  the 
world,  who  healest  human  infirmities,  who  invitest  to  thyself,  and  givest 
rest  unto,  those  who  labour  and  are  heavy-laden:  who  didst  come 
to  call  not  the  righteous  but  sinners  to  repentance.  Purify  me  from  all 
uncleanness,  both  bodily  and  spiritual,  and  teach  me  to  fulfil  holiness  in 
thy  fear;  that  having  received  a  portion  of  thy  Holy  Things  with  the 


PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY  COMMUNION     571 

testimony  of  my  pure  conscience,  I  may  be  united  unto  thy  holy  Body 
and  Blood,  and  may  possess  thee,  dwelling  within  me  and  abiding  with  the 
Father  and  thy  Holy  Spirit.  Yea,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  my  God,  let  the 
communion  of  thine  All-pure  and  Life-giving  Mysteries  be  not  unto  me 
for  condemnation,  and  let  me  not  be  infirm  in  body  and  soul  because  I 
have  partaken  thereof  unworthily.  But  grant  that,  even  unto  my  last 
breath,  I  may  partake  uncondemned  of  thy  Holy  Things,  unto  commun- 
ion with  the  Holy  Spirit,  unto  a  viaticum  for  life  eternal,  unto  an  ac- 
ceptable defence  at  thy  dread  Judgment  Seat.  And  let  me,  together  with 
all  thine  elect,  be  a  partaker  of  the  incorruptible  good  things  which  thou 
hast  prepared,  O  Lord,  for  those  who  love  thee;  in  whom,  also,  thou  art 
glorified  forever.     Amen. 

II. 

A  Prayer  of  St.  John  Chrysostom. 

I  know,  O  Lord  my  God,  that  I  am  unworthy  and  am  not  meet  that 
thou  shouldest  enter  beneath  the  roof  of  the  temple  of  my  soul,  because 
it  is  all  empty  and  dead ;  and  there  is  in  me  no  worthy  place  wherein  thou 
mayest  lay  thy  head.  But  inasmuch  as  thou  from  thy  loftiness  didst 
humble  thyself  for  our  sake,  so  likewise  do  thou  now  humble  thyself  unto 
my  humility :  and  as  it  seemed  good  unto  thee  to  lie  in  the  cavern  and  in 
the  manger  of  dumb  beasts,  so  also  now  graciously  vouchsafe  to  lie  in  the 
manger  of  my  dumb  soul,  and  to  enter  into  my  defiled  body.  As  thou 
didst  not  disdain  to  enter  into  the  house  of  Simon  the  leper,  and  there  to 
sit  at  meat  with  sinners,  so  also  graciously  vouchsafe  to  enter  into  the 
house  of  my  humble  soul,  which  is  leprous  and  sinful.  As  thou  didst  not 
reject  the  woman,  a  harlot  and  a  sinner  like  unto  me,  who  came  and 
touched  thee,  so  also  show  thou  mercy  upon  me,  a  sinner,  who  now  come 
unto  thee  and  touch  thee.  As  thou  didst  feel  no  loathing  for  the  polluted 
lips  of  the  woman  which  kissed  thee,  so  also  loathe  thou  not  my  even 
more  defiled  and  polluted  lips  and  unclean  tongue.  But  may  the  fiery 
coal  of  thine  all-pure  Body  and  of  thy  precious  Blood  be  unto  the  sancti- 
fication,  enlightenment  and  health  of  my  humble  soul  and  body,  unto  the 
lightening  of  the  burden  of  my  many  sins,  unto  preservation  from  every 
operation  of  the  Devil,  unto  the  expulsion  and  interdiction  of  my  evil  and 
wicked  manner  of  life,  unto  the  mortification  of  passions,  unto  instruc- 
tion in  thy  commandments,  unto  the  acquiring  of  thy  divine  grace,  unto 
the  inheritance  of  thy  kingdom.  For  I  come  unto  thee,  O  Christ-God, 
not  with  disdain,  but  trusting  in  thine  unspeakable  goodness,  and  in 
order  that  through  long  absenting  of  myself  from  communion  with  thee  I 
be  not  seized  by  the  invisible  wolf.  Wherefore  I  pray  thee,  in  that  thou 
alone  art  holy,  O  Master:  Sanctify  thou  my  soul  and  body,  my  mind  and 
heart,  my  belly  and  my  reins,  and  renew  thou  me  altogether.     Establish 


572    PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY  COMMUNION 

thy  fear  in  my  members,  and  make  thy  sanctification  to  be  inalienable 
from  me.  Be  thou  my  helper  and  defender,  guiding  my  life  in  peace, 
enabling  me  to  stand  at  thy  right  hand  with  thy  Saints:  through  the 
prayers  and  supplications  of  thy  Mother;  of  thy  bodiless  servitors,  the 
all-pure  heavenly  hosts;  and  of  all  the  saints  who,  in  all  the  ages,  have 
been  well-pleasing  unto  thee.     Amen. 

III. 

A  Prayer  of  Simeon  Metaphrastes. 

Like  as  I  were  now  standing  before  thy  dread  and  upright  Judgment 
Seat,  O  Christ-God,  receiving  sentence  and  rendering  an  accounting  of  the 
sins  I  have  committed,  so  also  now,  ere  that  day  of  my  condemnation  be 
come,  standing  before  thee  at  thy  holy  Altar  and  before  thy  terrible  and 
holy  angels,  convicted  by  mine  own  conscience,  I  offer  as  a  sacrifice  unto 
thee  my  evil  and  iniquitous  deeds,  declaring  and  condemning  them. 
Look  upon  my  humility,  O  Lord,  and  pardon  all  my  sins.  Behold,  mine 
iniquities  have  exceeded  the  number  of  the  hairs  upon  my  head.  For 
what  evil  is  there  that  I  have  not  done?  What  sin  is  there  that  I  have 
not  committed?  What  evil  thing  is  there  that  I  have  not  meditated  in  my 
soul?  I  am  guilty  of  fornication  and  of  adultery,  of  pride,  arrogance, 
condemnation  of  others,  censure,  idle  conversation,  unworthy  laughter, 
drunkenness,  gluttony,  hatred,  envy,  cupidity,  avarice,  usury,  self-love, 
ambition,  rapacity;  of  untruthfulness,  unjust  acquisition,  jealousy, 
calumny,  and  of  impiety.  I  have  polluted,  corrupted  and  rendered  lewd 
all  my  senses  and  members,  in  all  things  fulfilling  the  will  of  the  Devil.  I 
know,  O  Lord,  that  mine  iniquities  are  gone  over  my  head;  but  thy 
bounties  are  immeasurable,  thy  benignant  goodness  is  unutterable,  and 
there  is  no  sin  which  can  overcome  thy  love  of  mankind.  Wherefore,  O 
King  most  marvellous,  O  Lord  benign,  reveal  thy  mercies  also  upon  me, 
a  sinner;  show  forth  the  power  of  thy  clemency;  manifest  the  might  of 
thine  ineffable  tenderness  of  heart,  and  accept  me,  a  sinner,  who  now 
have  recourse  unto  thee.  Accept  me  as  thou  didst  accept  the  prodigal 
son,  as  thou  didst  accept  the  thief  and  the  woman  who  was  a  sinner. 
Accept  me,  who  have  beyond  measure  sinned  against  thee  in  word,  in 
deed,  in  unlawful  desires  and  in  foolish  thoughts.  As  thou  didst  receive 
those  who  came  unto  thee  at  the  eleventh  hour,  and  had  done  nothing 
worthy,  so  also  receive  thou  me,  a  sinner;  for  I  have  sinned  greatly,  I 
have  defiled  myself,  I  have  offended  thy  Holy  Spirit,  and  have  grieved 
thy  love  both  in  deed,  and  in  word,  and  in  thought,  both  by  day  and 
by  night,  both  secretly  and  openly,  both  voluntarily  and  involuntarily. 
I  know,  O  Lord,  that  thou  wilt  set  my  sins  before  me  as  they  were 
committed  by  me,  and  wilt  demand  of  me  an  accounting  of  that 
wherein  I  have  unpardonably  transgressed.    But  O  Lord,  Lord!   Convict 


PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY  COMMUNION    573 

me  not  at  thy  just  Judgment,  neither  condemn  me  in  thine  anger,  and 
chastise  me  not  with  thy  wrath;  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  I  am 
not  only  helpless,  but  I  am  also  the  work  of  thy  hands.  Thou,  O  Lord, 
hast  confirmed  thy  fear  upon  me,  yet  I  have  done  evil  in  thy  sight. 
Against  thee  only  have  I  sinned ;  but  I  entreat  thee :  Enter  thou  not  into 
judgment  with  thy  servant:  for  if  thou,  Lord,  wilt  regard  iniquity,  Lord, 
who  shall  stand?  I  am  an  abyss  of  sin,  and  unworthy  to  look  up  and  be- 
hold the  heights  of  heaven  because  of  my  many  sins,  which  are  without 
number.  For  in  me  there  is  no  lack  of  every  sort  of  misdoing,  neither  of 
guile,  nor  of  satanic  wiliness,  of  presumption,  of  sinful  thoughts,  and  of 
many  other  passions.  With  what  sins  have  not  I  defiled  myself!  Unto 
what  evil  habits  have  not  I  been  in  bondage!  I  have  committed  every 
sin,  I  have  filled  my  soul  with  every  sort  of  uncleanness,  and  have  become 
worthless  for  thee,  my  God,  and  for  men.  Who  shall  reestablish  me,  who 
have  fallen  into  such  evil  and  countless  transgressions?  O  Lord,  my  God, 
on  thee  do  I  set  my  trust!  If  it  be  possible  for  me  to  hope  for  salvation, 
if  the  multitude  of  my  iniquities  are  vanquished  by  thy  love  for  mankind, 
—  then  be  thou  unto  me  a  Saviour :  according  to  thy  bounties  and  thy 
mercies,  loose,  remit  unto  me,  forgive  all  things  wherein  I  have  sinned 
against  thee,  seeing  that  my  soul  is  filled  with  many  sins  and  there  is  no 
hope  of  salvation  in  me.  Have  mercy  upon  me,  0  God,  according  to  thy 
great  mercy;  requite  me  not  according  to  my  deeds;  judge  me  not  accord- 
ing to  my  acts;  but  turn  thou  me  again;  be  thou  my  defender;  deliver 
thou  my  soul  from  mine  increasing  iniquities  and  from  my  frightful  im- 
aginations. Save  me  for  thy  mercy's  sake,  that  where  sin  was  multiplied 
there  also  may  thy  grace  abound.  And  I  will  laud  and  glorify  thee  for- 
ever, all  the  days  of  my  life ;  for  thou  art  the  God  of  the  penitent  and  the 
Saviour  of  those  who  have  sinned;  and  unto  thee  do  we  ascribe  glory, 
together  with  thy  Father  who  hath  no  beginning,  and  thine  all-holy,  and 
good,  and  life-giving  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

IV. 

A  Prayer  of  Simeon,  the  New  Theologian. 

From  lips  defiled,  from  heart  iniquitous,  from  tongue  impure,  from 
soul  polluted,  receive  thou  my  prayer,  O  my  Christ,  and  despise  not  my 
words,  imaginations  and  presumption.  Vouchsafe  that  I  may  speak 
boldly,  O  my  Christ,  that  which  I  desire.  Teach  me,  moreover,  that 
which  I  ought  to  do  and  to  say.  I  have  sinned  above  the  sinning  woman 
who,  having  learned  where  the  Lord  was,  and  having  bought  ointment, 
came  fearlessly  to  anoint  thy  feet,  my  God,  my  Master  and  my  Christ. 
As  thou  didst  not  repulse  her,  when  she  came  from  the  impulse  of  her 
heart,  so  also  despise  thou  not  me,  O  Word,  and  grant  that  I,  also,  may 


574     PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY  COMMUNION 

clasp  thy  feet  and  kiss  them  and  fearlessly  anoint  them  with  floods  of 
tears,  as  with  precious  ointment.   Wash  me  and  purify  me  with  my  tears, 

0  Word;  remit  my  transgressions  ami  grant  me  pardon.  Thou  knowest 
the  multitude  of  my  evil-doings;  thou  knowest  also  my  scars;  thou  seest 
my  wickedness.  But  thou  knowest  also  my  faith,  and  beholdest  my 
earnest  desire,  and  hearest  my  sighing.  Not  a  single  tear-drop,  nor  even 
a  single  portion  of  a  drop,  is  hidden  from  thee,  O  my  God,  my  Maker,  my 
Deliverer.  Thine  eyes  behold  also  that  which  I  have  not  yet  done :  in  thy 
book  is  written  also  that  which,  as  yet,  is  not  performed.  Thou  seest  my 
humility,  thou  seest  my  infirmities  and  all  my  sins.  Remit  them,  0  God 
of  all  men,  that  with  a  pure  heart,  with  trembling  mind  and  contrite  soul 

1  may  partake  of  thine  undefiled  and  all-holy  Mysteries,  wherewith  is 
quickened  and  made  a  participant  of  the  divine  every  man  who  eateth 
and  drinketh  thereof  with  a  pure  heart.     Thou  hast  said,  0  my  Lord: 
Every  one  who  eateth  my  flesh  and  drinketh  my  blood  abideth  in  me,  and 
I  in  him.     True  is  every  word  of  my  Lord  and  God.     Partaking  of  the 
divine  Mysteries  which  make  men  like  unto  God,  I  am  no  longer  alone,  but 
abide  O,  my  Christ,  with  thee,  the  all-effulgent  Light  which  illumineth,  the 
world.     And  I  shall  not  be  left  without  thee,  the  Life-giver,  my  Breath, 
my  life,  my  joy,  the  salvation  of  the  world.    Wherefore  I  draw  near  unto 
thee,  as  thou  seest,  with  tears  and  a  contrite  soul,  and  implore  thee  that 
thou  wilt  vouchsafe  unto  me  to  receive  remission  of  my  transgressions, 
and  to  partake,  uncondemned,  of  thy  spotless  and  life-giving  Mysteries. 
Abide  with  me,  the  greatly-accursed  one,  as  thou  hast  promised,  that 
the  Evil  One  may  not  craftily  tempt  me,  and  having  tempted,  may  not 
lead  me  astray  from  thy  precepts  which  render  god-like.   And  therefore  I 
fall  down  before  thee,  and  I  cry  fervently  unto  thee:  As  thou  didst  accept 
the  prodigal  son,  as  thou  didst  accept  the  sinning  woman  who  came  unto 
thee,  so  also  receive  thou  me,  who  am  a  prodigal  and  vile,  O  Bountiful 
One!     Having  now  recourse  unto  thee  with  a  contrite  soul,  I  know,  O 
my  Saviour,  that  no  other  man  hath  so  sinned  against  thee  as  have  I, 
no  other  man  hath  wrought  such  deeds  as  have  I.     But  I  know,  also, 
that  neither  the  magnitude  of  the  transgression,  nor  the  multitude  of  the 
sins  can  transcend  the  great  long-suffering  and  unutterable  love  toward 
mankind  of  my  God.     According  to  thy  mercy  and  condescension  thou 
cleansest  those  who  repent  with  their  whole  heart;  thou  cleansest  and 
enlightenest  them,  and  makest  them  participants  of  the  light,  and  sharers 
of  thy  Divinity.    And,  albeit  it  is  strange  for  angels  and  men  to  compre- 
hend, thou  ofttimes  holdest  converse  with  them  as  with  thy  true  friends. 
All  this  doth  render  me  bold,  all  this  doth  give  me  wings,  O  my  Christ. 
And  confidently  setting  my  hope  on  thy  rich  mercy  to  usward,  both  with 
joy  and  trembling,  I  partake  of  fire,  being  myself  but  grass.     And  —  O 
marvellous  wonder!  —  I  am  not  consumed  but  am  sprinkled  with  dew,  as 
was  of  old  the  bush  which  burned  yet  was  not  consumed.     Now,  with 


PRAYERS  IN  PREPARATION  FOR  THE  HOLY  COMMUNION     575 

grateful  thoughts,  with  grateful  heart,  with  grateful  members  both  of  my 
soul  and  of  my  body,  I  bow  in  worship,  I  laud  and  glorify  thee,  O  my  God, 
who  art  blessed  now  and  forevermore. 

V- 

A  Prayer  of  St.  John  of  Damascus. 

I  stand  before  the  doors  of  thy  temple,  yet  refrain  not  from  wicked 
thoughts.  But  O  Christ-God,  who  didst  justify  the  publican,  and  didst 
show  mercy  upon  the  woman  of  Cana,  and  didst  open  the  doors  of  Paradise 
to  the  thief,  —  open  thou  unto  me  also  thy  loving-kindness,  and  accept 
thou  me,  who  am  come  and  who  touch  thee,  as  thou  didst  accept  also 
the  woman  who  was  a  sinner,  and  the  woman  who  had  an  issue  of  blood. 
One  of  them,  through  touching  the  hem  of  thy  garment,  received  perfect 
healing;  and  the  other,  clasping  thine  all-pure  feet,  carried  away  the  for- 
giveness of  her  sins.  And  let  me  not  be  consumed,  accursed  though  I  be, 
through  daring  to  receive  thy  Body.  But  accept  thou  me,  as  thou  didst 
accept  them,  and  illumine  my  spiritual  senses,  consuming  my  sinful 
offences:  through  the  prayers  of  Her  who  bore  thee  without  seed,  and  of 
the  heavenly  Powers:  For  blessed  art  thou,  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

VI. 

A  Prayer  of  St.  John  Chrysostom. 

I  believe,  OLord,  and  I  confess,  that  thou  art  in  very  truth  the  Christ, 
the  Son  of  the  living  God,  who  didst  come  into  the  world  to  save  sinners, 
of  whom  I  am  chief.  And  I  believe  that  this  is,  of  a  truth,  thine  all-pure 
Body,  and  that  this  is  thine  own  precious  Blood.  Wherefore,  I  beseech 
thee,  have  mercy  upon  me,  and  forgive  my  transgressions,  whether  vol- 
untary or  involuntary;  whether  of  word  or  of  deed;  whether  committed 
with  knowledge  or  in  ignorance.  And  vouchsafe  that  I  may  partake 
without  condemnation  of  thine  all-pure  Mysteries,  unto  the  remission  of 
my  sins,  and  unto  life  eternal.     Amen.

Hymns  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried  unto  thee. 

Accept  our  evening  petitions,  O  holy  Lord,  and  grant  us  remission  of 
our  sins:  For  thou  only  revealest  Resurrection  unto  the  world. 

Go  ye  round  about  Zion,  ye  people,  and  encompass  her,  and  give  glory 
therein  to  him  who  is  risen  from  the  dead :  For  he  is  our  God  who  deliv- 
ered! us  from  our  sins. 

O  come,  ye  people,  let  us  sing  praises  and  worship  Christ,  glorifying  his 
Resurrection  from  the  dead:  For  he  is  our  God,  who  delivereth  the  world 
from  the  wiles  o-f  the  enemy - 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  Let  us  sing  the  praises  of 
Mary,  Virgin,  Door  of  heaven,  Glory  of  all  the  world,  sprung  forth  from 
man,  who  also  bare  the  Lord;  the  Song  of  the  Bodiless  Powers,  and 
the  Enriching  of  the  faithful.  For  she  revealed  herself  as  Heaven  and 
the  Temple  of  the  Godhead.  She  destroyed  the  bulwarks  of  enmity, 
ushered  in  peace,  and  threw  open  the  kingdom.  Wherefore,  in  that  we 
possess  this  confirmation  of  our  faith  we  have  a  defender,  even  the  Lord 
who  was  born  of  her.  Be  bold,  therefore,  be  bold,  ye  people  of  God,  for  he, 
the  All-Powerful,  will  vanquish  your  foes. 

Hymn  (Tropar).  While  the  stone  was  sealed  by  the  Jews,  and  soldiers 
stood  on  guard  over  thy  body  undefined,  thou  didst  rise  on  the  third  day, 
O  Saviour,  who  givest  life  unto  the  world.  For  which  cause  the  Heavenly 
Powers  cried  aloud  unto  thee,  O  Giver  of  Life:  Glory  to  thy  resurrection, 
O  Christ !  Glory  to  thy  kingdom !  Glory  to  thy  providence,  O  thou  who 
alone  lovest  mankind! 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  As  Gabriel  proclaimed 
unto  thee,  O  Virgin:  Hail!  With  that  cry  did  the  Lord  of  all  become  in- 
carnate in  thee,  the  Holy  Tabernacle,  as  spake  the  righteous  David: 
Thou  hast  manifested  thyself  more  spacious  than  the  heavens,  in  that

thou  hast  borne  thy  Creator.  Glory  to  him  who  abode  in  thee!  Glory 
to  him  who  came  forth  from  thee !  Glory  to  him  who  through  thy  birth- 
giving  hath  set  us  free! 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  As  God  thou  didst  arise  from  the  grave  in 
glorv,  and  with  thee  didst  raise  the  world;  and  the  race  of  men  singeth 
praises  unto  thee  as  God;  and  Death  hath  vanished;  and  Adam  leapeth 
for  joy,  O  Lord;  and  Eve,  now  released  from  her  bonds,  exulteth,  crying: 
Thou  art  he  who  giveth  Resurrection  unto  all  men,  O  Christ.

Theme-Song  (Irmos).  In  godlike  wise  hath  thy  victorious  right  arm

Hymns  (Tropari).  Thou  who,  with  hands  most  pure,  in  the  beginning, 
in  that  thou  art  God,  divinely  created  me  out  of  the  dust,  didst  stretch 
forth  thine  arms  upon  the  cross,  summoning  from  the  earth  my  corrupti- 
ble body,  which  thou  thyself  also  didst  accept  from  a  Virgin.  Ц 

Unto  dissolution  thou  didst  subject  thyself  for  my  sake,  and  didst 
yield  up  thy  soul  unto  death,  O  thou  who  with  thy  divine  in-breathing 
didst  infuse  into  me  a  soul.  And  when  thou  hadst  rent  asunder  the  bonds 
which  were  from  everlasting,  and  with  thee  didst  raise  up  the  dead,  thou 
wert  glorified  in  incorruption.  fy 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  Hail,  O  Fount  of  Grace!

endured  the  cross  he  was  delivered  over  to  the  tomb,  for  his  own  good 
will  it  was  so  to  do;  and  when  he  rose  again  from  the  dead  he  saved  me, 
the  man  who  had  gone  astray. 


58o  APPENDIX  A  Tone  II 

Christ  our  Saviour,  when  he  had  nailed  to  the  cross  the  handwriting 
against  us,  brought  it  to  naught  and  annihilated  the  dominion  of  death. 
We  adore  his  awakening  again  from  death  on  the  third  day. 

With  the  Archangels  let  us  sing  the  Resurrection  of  Christ:  for  he 
is  the  Redeemer  and  Saviour  of  our  souls;  and  he  shall  come  again,  in 
glory  most  terrible,  in  power  most  mighty,  to  judge  the  world  which  he 
hath  made. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  The  shadow  of  the  Law 
passed  away  when  grace  came;  for  as  the  bush  burned  with  fire  yet  was 
not  consumed,  even  so  as  a  Virgin  didst  thou  bring  forth  yet  remainedst 
Virgin  still.  In  place  of  the  pillar  of  fire  there  rose  the  Sun  of  Righteous- 
ness; in  place  of  Moses,  Christ,  the  Salvation  of  our  souls. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  When  thou  didst  condescend  unto  death,  O  Life 
Immortal,  thou  didst  slay  Hell  with  the  lightning  flash  of  thy  divinity. 
When  also  thou  didst  raise  up  the  dead  from  the  subterranean  abodes, 
all  the  Powers  of  heaven  cried  aloud:  O  Life-giver,  Christ  our  God,  glory 
to  thee ! 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  Beyond  the  power  of 
thought,  exceeding  glorious  are  all  thy  mysteries,  O  Birth-giver  of  God; 
sealed  in  purity  and  preserved  in  virginity,  thou  art  acknowledged  to  be, 
in  very  truth,  the  Mother  who  didst  bring  forth  the  true  God;  wherefore 
entreat  thou  him  that  our  souls  may  be  saved. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  Thou  didst  rise  from  the  tomb,  O  Saviour 
almighty,  and  Hell  was  affrighted  when  it  beheld  the  marvel;  and  the 
dead  arose;  Creation,  also,  beholding,  exulted  with  thee,  and  Adam  re- 
joiced exceedingly.  And  the  world,  O  my  Saviour,  singeth  thy  praises 
forevermore.

VII.  The  impious  command  of  the  cruel  tyrant  forced  the  flame  on 
high;  but  Christ  bore  unto  the  God-fearing  Children  spiritual  dew. 
Blessed  and  most  glorious  is  he.     R.  and  Hs. 

VIII.  The  fiery  furnace  of  old  in  Babylon  divided  in  twain  its  action, 
by  the  command  of  God  consuming  the  Chaldseans,  but  sprinkling  with 
dew  the  faithful  who  sang:  O  all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye  the  Lord.

mine those  who  sat  in  darkness,  and  to  gather  together  those  who  were 
scattered  abroad:  for  which  cause  we  magnify  the  all-hymned  Birth-

Verses  and  Hymns  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried  unto  thee. 

By  thy  cross,  O  Christ  our  Saviour,  the  dominion  of  death  hath  been 
destroyed  and  the  delusion  of  the  Devil  overthrown;  the  generation  of 
men  also,  being  saved  by  faith,  doth  offer  unto  thee  a  perpetual  song. 

All  things  have  been  illumined  by  thy  Resurrection,  O  Lord,  and 
Paradise  hath  been  opened  once  again;  and  all  creation  extolling  thee 
doth  offer  unto  thee  a  perpetual  song. 

I  glorify  the  might  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  I  sing  the  power;  the  Godhead,  undivided,  uncreated,  the  Trinity 
of  one  Essence,  who  reigneth  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  How  can  we  refrain  from 
wonder  at  thy  human-divine  birth-giving,  O  All-august  One?  For 
though  thou  receivedst  not  the  embrace  of  man,  O  All-undefiled  One, 
yet  didst  thou  bear,  without  a  father,  a  son  in  the  flesh  born  of  the 
Father  without  mother  before  the  ages :  who  suffered  no  change,  neither 
mingling  nor  division,  but  preserved  intact  the  peculiar  natures  of  both. 
Wherefore,  O  Maiden  Mother,  Sovereign  Lady,  beseech  thou  him  that 
the  souls  of  those  may  be  saved  who,  in  the  true  faith,  confess  thee  to 
be  the  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  Let  the  heavens  rejoice  and  let  the  earth  be  glad,

Death  by  death ;  he  is  become  the  first-born  of  the  dead ;  from  the  womb

Mediatrix  of  the  salvation  of  our  race,  we  sing,  O  Birth-giver  of  God  and 
Virgin.  For  in  the  flesh  assumed  from  thee,  after  that  he  had  suffered 
the  passion  of  the  cross,  thy  Son  and  our  God  delivered  us  from  corruption, 
in  that  he  loveth  mankind.

me,  as  thou  savedst  Peter  of  old,  O  my  Pilot.     R.  and  Hs. 

VII.  As  thou  of  old  didst  refresh  with  dew  the  three  godly  Children 
in  the  Chaldsean  flames,  even  so  illumine  thou  with  the  radiant  fire  of  the 
Godhead  us  who  cry  unto  thee:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 
R.  and  Hs. 

VIII.  When  the  godly  Children  were  thrust  into  the  fire  intolerable, 
yet  remained  without  hurt  from  the  flame,  they  sang  the  song  divine:  O 
all  ye  works  of  the  Lord,  bless  ye  the  Lord  and  exalt  him  unto  all  the

gates  of  a  Virgin  the  Lord  passeth  forth  to  sight;  naked  at  his  going-in,

Unceasingly  do  we  adore  thy  life-giving  Cross,  O  Christ  our  God,  and 
glorify  thy  Resurrection  on  the  third  day;  for  thereby,  O  Almighty  One, 
thou  didst  renew  the  nature  of  man,  which  had  become  corrupt,  and 
didst  restore  to  us  the  way  to  heaven :  For  thou  only  art  good  and  lovest 
mankind. 

Thou  hast  done  away  with  the  penalty  of  the  tree  of  disobedience, 
O  Saviour,  in  that  thou,  of  thine  own  good  will,  wast  nailed  to  the  tree 
of  the  Cross;  and  when  thou  hadst  descended  into  Hell,  O  Mighty  One, 
thou  didst  break  the  bonds  of  death,  in  that  thou  wert  God:  For  which 
cause  we  worship  thy  Resurrection  from  the  dead,  joyfully  crying  unto 
thee:  O  Lord  Almighty,  glory  to  thee. 

Thou  hast  destroyed  the  gates  of  Hell,  O  Lord,  and  by  thy  death  hast 
annihilated  the  kingdom  of  Death,  and  hast  freed  the  human  race  from 
corruption,  giving  life  and  incorruption  and  great  mercy  unto  the  world. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  The  Prophet  David  who, 
through  thee,  was  the  forefather  of  God,  did  prophesy  in  melody  con- 
cerning thee,  to  him  who  wrought  mighty  things  for  thee:  Upon  thy 
right  hand  did  stand  the  Queen.  For  God,  who  was  graciously  pleased 
without  father  to  become  incarnate  of  thee,  hath  manifested  thee  as  the 
Mother  and  Ambassador  of  life,  that  he  might  restore  again  his  image, 
which  had  become  corrupted  by  passions;  and  that  Christ,  who  is  great 
and  rich  in  mercy,  when  he  had  found  the  sheep  which  was  gone  astray 
wandering  on  the  mountains,  and  had  laid  it  on  his  shoulders,  might 
bring  it  to  his  Father,  and  according  to  his  will  unite  it  to  the  heavenly 
powers,  and  save  the  world,  O  Birth-giver  of  God. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  When  the  Women  Disciples  of  the  Lord  had  learned 
from  the  Angels  the  glad  tidings  of  the  Resurrection,  and  had  cast  away 
the  condemnation  of  their  forefathers,  they  spake  exultingly  to  the 
Apostles:  Death  is  no  more;  Christ-God  is  risen,  granting  unto  the  world 
great  mercy. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogordditchen).  The  mystery  which 
was  hidden  from  everlasting  and  was  unknown  of  the  Angels,  through 
thee,  O  Birth-giver  of  God,  was  revealed  to  those  who  dwell  upon  earth, 
in  that  God  having  become  incarnate  in  unblended  union,  of  his  own 
good  will  accepted  the  Cross  for  our  sakes;  whereby  he  raised  again  the 
first  created  and  hath  saved  our  souls. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  My  Saviour  and  Redeemer  from  the  grave,  in 
that  he  was  God,  rose  from  earth-born  bonds,  and  shattered  the  gates  of

He  who  giveth  Resurrection  to  the  generation  of  men  was  led  as  a

the  gates  of  lamentation  were  lifted  up.  For  Christ,  the  King  of  Glory,

who  were  in  darkness:  Unveil  yourselves.

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  In  the  Red  Sea  of  old  was 
set  forth  the  type  of  the  Bride  unwedded:  there  Moses  was  the  divider  of 
the  water;  but  here  Gabriel  was  the  minister  of  the  miracle.  Then  Israel 
passed  over  the  deep  with  foot  unwet ;  but  now  a  Virgin  hath,  without  seed, 
given  birth  to  Christ.  The  sea,  after  Israel  had  passed  over,  remained  im- 
passable; the  Blameless  One,  after  the  conception  of  Emmanuel,  remained 
undented.  Thou  who  Art,  and  who  from  ever-lasting  Art,  hast  revealed 
thyself  in  fashion  as  a  man :  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God. 

Hymn  (Tropar).  The  Word,  who  with  the  Father  and  the  Spirit  hath 
no  beginning,  and  who,  for  our  salvation,  was  born  of  a  Virgin,  let  us 
faithful  believers  hymn  and  adore.  For  it  was  his  good  pleasure  to  ascend 
the  cross  in  the  flesh,  and  to  suffer  death,  and  through  his  own  glorious 
Resurrection  to  raise  the  dead. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen).  Hail,  O  impassable 
Gate  of  the  Lord!  Hail,  Wall  and  Shelter  of  those  who  flee  unto  thee! 
Hail,  Haven  unvexed  of  storms  and  Unwedded  One  who  didst  bring  forth 
in  the  flesh  thy  Maker  and  thy  God!  Abate  not  thine  entreaties  on  be- 
half of  those  who  sing  thy  praises  and  do  homage  to  thy  birth-giving. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk).  Into  Hell  thou  didst  descend,  O  my  Saviour, 
and  when  thou  hadst  destroyed  its  gates,  in  that  thou  art  almighty,  thou 
didst  raise  again  with  thee  those  who  were  dead,  in  that  thou  art  the 
Creator;  and  thou  didst  destroy  the  sting  of  death,  O  Christ,  and  didst 
release  Adam  from  the  curse,  O  thou  who  lovest  mankind.  Wherefore

From  thee,  O  Lord,  who  art  present  in  all  creation,  whither  shall  we

Thou  didst  trample  Death  under  foot.  To  the  depths  of  the  sea?  There,

wondrous  wise  become  incarnate,  being  by  nature  God,  and  becoming  by 
nature  a  man,  for  our  sake;  not  being  divided  in  two  persons,  but  known

vailed upon  the  tormentor  to  cry  aloud:  Blessed  art  thou,  O  God  of  our 
fathers.     R.  and  Hs. 

VIII.  Out  of  the  flames  thou  didst  shed  forth  dew  upon  the  Godly 
Ones,  and  with  water  didst  kindle  the  sacrifice  of  the  Righteous  One. 
For  thou  doest  all  things  which  thou  wiliest,  O  Christ.  Thee  will  we 
exalt  unto  all  the  ages.     R.  and  Hs.

IX.  It  is  not  possible  that  men  should  see  God,  upon  whom  the  Orders 
of  the  Angels  dare  not  gaze:  but  through  thee,  O  All-pure  One,  was  the 
Word  Incarnate  manifested  unto  men:  Whom  magnifying,  together 
with  the  Heavenly  Hosts,  we  call  thee  blessed.     R.  and  Hs.

Hymns  for:  Lord,  I  have  cried  unto  thee. 

O  come,  let  us  rejoice  in  the  Lord,  who  hath  destroyed  the  power  of 
death,  and  illumined  the  generation  of  men,  crying  with  the  Bodiless 
Ones:  O  our  Maker  and  Saviour,  glory  to  thee. 

For  our  sake,  O  Saviour,  thou  didst  endure  the  cross  and  burial;  and 
by  death  didst  thou  slay  Death,  in  that  thou  art  God.  For  which  cause 
we  adore  thy  Resurrection  on  the  third  day:  Glory,  O  Lord,  to  thee. 

When  the  Apostles  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  their  Maker  they  were 
amazed,  and  sang  the  angelic  hymn  of  praise:  This  is  the  glory  of  the 
Church,  this  is  the  riches  of  the  kingdom:  O  Lord,  who  didst  suffer  for  our 
sake,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and 
ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  A  Mother  in  more  than 
human  wise  art  thou  acknowledged,  O  Birth-giver  of  God;  yet  thou  didst 
remain  Virgin  beyond  speech  and  beyond  understanding;  and  the 
marvel  of  thy  birth-giving  can  no  tongue  declare.  Most  glorious  in  the 
nature  of  thy  conception,  O  Pure  One,  incomprehensible  likewise  is  the 
manner  of  thy  true  birth-giving:  for  when  God  so  willeth  the  order  of 
nature  is  conquered.  Wherefore,  in  that  we  perceive  thee  to  be  the 
Mother  of  God,  with  diligence  we  all  beseech  thee  that  our  souls  may  be 
saved. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  By  thy  cross  thou  didst  destroy  death;  thou  didst 
open  paradise  to  the  Thief;  thou  didst  change  the  funeral  wail  of  the 
Myrrh-bearing  Women,  and  didst  command  them  to  announce  unto 
thine  Apostles  that  thou  wert  risen  from  the  dead,  O  Christ  our  God, 
who  bestowest  on  the  world  great  mercy. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogoroditchen) .  In  that  thou  art  the 
Treasury  of  our  Resurrection,  lead  thou  forth  from  the  pit  and  deep  of 
transgressions  those  who  set  their  hope  on  thee,  O  All-hymned  One! 
For  thou  hast  saved  those  who  were  guilty  of  sin,  in  that  thou  didst  give 
birth  to  our  Salvation:  O  thou  who  before  birth-giving  wast  Virgin,  and 
in  birth-giving  wast  Virgin,  and  after  birth-giving  remainest  Virgin  still. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk) .  No  longer  can  the  power  of  death  hold  mortals 
in  captivity;  for  Christ  hath  descended,  shattering  and  bringing  to  naught 
its  powers.  Hell  is  fettered;  the  Prophets  with  one  accord  rejoice,  say- 
ing: The  Saviour  hath  appeared  unto  those  who  believe:  Come  forth,  ye 
faithful,  unto  the  Resurrection.

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Dogmdtik).  The  King  of  Heaven, 
because  of  his  love  toward  mankind,  hath  appeared  upon  earth  and 
dwelt  among  men:  for  he  was  incarnate  of  a  pure  Virgin,  and  came  forth 
from  her  through  that  incarnation,  the  Only  Son,  twofold  in  nature  but 
not  in  Essence.  Wherefore,  proclaiming  him,  in  very  truth,  perfect 
God  and  perfect  man,  we  confess  Christ  to  be  our  true  God:  Whom  do 
thou  implore,  O  Mother  unwedded,  that  he  will  have  mercy  on  our  souls. 

Hymn  (Tropdr).  Thou  didst  descend  from  on  high,  O  Tender-hearted 
One;  thou  didst  endure  the  three-days'  burial,  that  thou  mightest  free  us 
from  our  passions,  O  our  Life  and  Resurrection.    Glory,  O  Lord,  to  thee. 

Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God  (Bogordditchen).  Thou  who  for  our  sake 
wast  born  of  a  Virgin,  and  didst  suffer  crucifixion,  O  Good  One,  and 
didst  despoil  Death  through  death,  and  as  God  didst  reveal  Resurrection: 
Despise  not  those  whom  thou  hast  created  with  thine  own  hand;  show 
forth  thy  love  for  mankind,  O  Merciful  One;  accept  the  Birth-giver  of 
God  who  bare  thee,  and  who  entreateth  thee  for  us;  and  save  thy  despair- 
ing people,-  O  our  Saviour. 

Collect-Hymn  (Konddk),  When  thou  didst  rise  again  from  the  tomb, 
thou  didst  waken  the  dead  and  didst  raise  up  Adam.  Eve  also  exulteth 
in  thy  Resurrection,  and  all  the  ends  of  the  earth  which  are  risen  from  the 
dead  in  thy  rising  do  celebrate   the  festival,  O  All-compassionate  One.

THE  ALL-NIGHT  VIGIL  OFFICE. 

(i)  The  Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Apostolic  Church  of  the  East  reckons 
its  day  after  the  pattern  of  the  Jewish  Church,  from  sunset.  Therefore 
the  worship  of  God  begins  with  the  Evening  Service,  which  typifies,  in 
general,  the  Old  Testament  times,  as  foreshadowing  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
and  his  life  on  earth,  and  precedes  the  Divine  Liturgy  of  the  morning, 
wherein  is  typified  the  life  of  our  Lord  as  set  forth  in  the  New  Testament 
and  his  life  in  heaven. 

On  ordinary  evenings,  Great  or  Lesser  Vespers  is  used.  On  Saturday 
evening,  and  on  the  eves  of  the  Great  Feasts,  is  celebrated  the  Vigil  Ser- 
vice, which  consists  of  portions  of  Great  Vespers,  combined  with  Matins. 
In  the  early  Church,  the  Vigil  Service  lasted  all  night,  as  its  name,  the 
"  Ail-Night  Vigil  Service,"  denotes;  and  at  the  present  day,  in  the  monas- 
teries of  the  East,  where  the  service  is  read  and  chanted  slowly,  and  in  its 
completeness,  it  so  lasts.  In  the  monasteries,  also,  are  used  the  Great  and 
Lesser  Later  Evensong  (Compline),  and  the  various  midnight  services. 

At  the  Saturday  evening  Vigil  Service,  the  Resurrection  of  our  Lord  is 
more  particularly  commemorated  and  exalted. 

On  Christmas  Eve,  and  on  the  Eves  of  the  Epiphany  and  sometimes  of 
the  Annunciation,  the  All-Night  Vigil  Office  consists  of  Great  Later  Even- 
song (Grand  Compline)  and  Matins. 

THE  SYMBOLISM  OF  GREAT  VESPERS. 

(2)  This  Exclamation  the  Priest  utters  after  the  Deacon  has  said  to  the 
brethren  who  have  assembled  for  Divine  Service,  and  are  seated: 
"Stand,"  and  asks  from  him  a  blessing  on  the  service:  "Bless,  Master." 

(3)  By  these  acts  of  devotion  the  thoughts  of  the  Christian  are  carried 
back  to  the  epoch  of  the  Creation  of  the  world,  to  the  blissful  state  of  our 
first  parents.  The  censing  typifies  the  saying  of  Genesis,  that  at  the 
Creation  the  Spirit  of  God,  the  true  Light  and  Incense  unto  the  elect, 
moved  over  the  face  of  the  waters.  The  opening  of  the  Holy  Doors  sig- 
nifies that,  from  the  creation  of  the  world,  man  was  appointed  to  dwell  in 
Paradise.  But  the  blissful  condition  of  mankind  was  of  brief  duration. 
As  a  token  of  the  fact  that  men  were  banished  from  Paradise  after  the 
Fall,  the  Holy  Doors  are  closed  after  the  Temple  has  been  censed. 

(4)  The  Priest  stands  before  the  Holy  Doors,  which  are  closed,  and 
reads  secretly  the  Prayers  of  Light,  thereby  typifying  Adam  sorrowing 
in  repentance  before  the  gates  of  Paradise.      The    Priest  reads  these 


APPENDIX  В  593 

prayers  with  uncovered  head,  in  token  of  penitence  and  humility.  In  the 
Service  Books  of  the  Church  these  prayers  are  called  "The  Prayers  of 
Light"  because  in  them  the  Priest  glorifies  the  Lord,  who  dwelleth  in 
Light  ineffable,  for  the  gift  of  material  light,  and  prays  for  illumination  of 
soul. 

(5)  All  the  Exclamations  pronounced  by  the  Priest  after  the  Litanies 
bear  a  close  relation  either  to  the  preceding  litanies,  to  the  prayers  read 
secretly  by  the  Priest,  or  to  the  chants  of  the  singers. 

(6)  "Kaffsma"  signifies  "sitting."  The  term  may  have  had  its  rise  in 
the  fact  that  sitting  was  appointed  while  certain  parts  of  the  Kafisma 
were  being  read,  verse  by  verse;  but  at  some  points  standing  was  enjoined. 
In  ancient  times  these  verses  were  chanted. 

(7)  These  verses  express  two  thoughts:  Adam's  repentance  for  his  sins, 
with  his  regret  for  the  Paradise  which  he  has  lost;  and  the  exhortation 
from  the  mouth  of  Adam  to  his  posterity  that  they  shall  utterly  obey  the 
will  of  God. 

(8)  The  Bogoroditchny  (Hymns  to  the  Birth-giver  of  God)  are  called 
"Dogmatiki,"  from  the  Greek  word  dogma,  or  doctrine;  so  that,  together 
with  the  praise  of  the  All-holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  they  contain  dogmatic 
teaching  concerning  the  person  of  Jesus  Christ,  and  in  particular  con- 
cerning the  incarnation  of  the  Lord  and  the  union  in  his  person  of  two 
natures  —  the  divine  and  the  human.  The  Hymn  to  the  Birth-giver  of 
God  is  sung  at  this  point  to  remind  us  that  she  was  the  Mediatrix  through 
whom,  by  the  birth  of  her  Holy  Son,  the  life  of  those  who  were  under  the 
dispensation  of  the  law  was  assuaged. 

(9)  The  Entrance  typifies  in  action  that  which  is  expressed  by  the 
chant:  "O  gladsome  radiance";  that  is  to  say,  that  the  Gladsome  Radi- 
ance has  shone  for  men  in  the  person  of  the  Saviour,  who,  for  the  sake  of 
men's  infirmities,  humbled  the  immortal  glory  of  the  heavenly  Father,  and 
came  down  from  heaven. 

The  Holy  Doors  are  opened,  in  token  that  with  the  coming  of  the  Lord 
the  Paradise  of  God  was  opened  to  men.  The  Priest  comes  forth  from  the 
Sanctuary  standing  erect,  with  his  chasuble  hanging  straight,  to  typify 
humility  and  majesty.  The  Deacon  precedes  the  Priest,  as  if  he  were  the 
Forerunner,  holding  the  censer  in  his  hand.  The  censer  with  its  incense 
signifies  that,  through  the  mediation  of  the  Lord,  our  prayers  are  borne 
upward  to  God  like  incense,  and  that  the  Holy  Spirit  is  present  in  the 
Temple.  The  Deacon  is  preceded  by  a  taper,  which  denotes  the  spiritual 
light  brought  by  the  Lord  to  earth. 

(10)  The  Gradual  (Prokimen)  (from  the  Greek,  signifying  that  which 
precedes),  is  the  verse  which  precedes  the  Lessons  from  Holy  Scripture, 
namely,  the  Parables  (Par emit),  the  Epistle  and  the  Gospel,  and  serves  as 
a  preface  to  the  Lesson.  The  Gradual,  generally  in  the  words  of  Holy 
Writ,  expresses  either  the  contents  and  application  of  the  Lesson  which 


594  APPENDIX  В 

follows  it,  or  the  significance  of  the  day;  that  is,  of  the  prayers  and  hymns 
which  relate  to  the  day. 

(n)  The  Lessons  from  Holy  Scripture  of  the  Old  Testament  (and  also 
sometimes  from  the  New  Testament)  are  called  Parables  (Paremii),  and 
contain  the  prophecies  of  the  event  commemorated  on  the  day;  or  explain 
the  force  of  the  Feast,  and  the  intent  with  which  it  was  established ;  or  set 
forth  the  praise  of  the  Saint  whose  festival  it  is. 

(12)  The  Litiyd  (from  the  Greek,  Liti,  litomai,  —  a  fervent  prayer). 
The  fervent  prayer  is  expressed  in  the  "Lord,  have  mercy  "  many  times 
repeated.  The  Litiyd  is  sometimes  performed  in  the  porch  of  the  Temple, 
or  on  the  steps;  sometimes  inside  the  Temple.  It  reminds  us  of  the 
ancient  Processions  of  the  Cross  in  the  streets,  more  especially  by  night; 
and  of  the  fervent  petitions  which  the  early  Christians  offered  up  during 
those  processions,  on  the  occasion  of  divers  public  calamities.  This  going 
forth  into  the  porch  for  the  Litiyd,  at  the  All-Night  Vigil,  after  the  Entrance 
and  the  Evening  Litany  (Ekteniya) ,  on  the  one  hand,  typifies  for  those  who 
stand  in  the  porch  (the  penitents)  the  same  thing  as  is  typified  for  those 
who  stand  in  the  Temple  by  the  Entrance  at  Vespers ;  that  is  to  say,  that 
our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  Gladsome  Radiance,  came  down  to  us  here 
below;  that  they  who  stand  in  the  porch  may  expect  mercy  from  the  Lord, 
and  the  remission  of  sins.  On  the  other  hand,  the  going-forth  of  the  faith- 
ful to  the  porch,  the  place  of  catechumens  and  penitents,  denotes  the  pro- 
found humility  of  the  Faithful,  who  are  ready  to  put  themselves  in  the 
place  of  the  learners  and  penitents,  and  pray  in  company  with  them. 

(13)  At  the  Blessing  of  the  Loaves  God's  blessing  is  asked  on  the  fer- 
tility of  the  earth  for  the  nourishment  of  men.  In  the  early  Church,  when 
the  All-Night  Vigil  lasted  until  the  morning,  it  was  customary  to  distrib- 
ute the  common  offerings  of  bread,  wine  and  oil  after  the  Vespers;  to  the 
end  that  the  Faithful  who  intended  to  remain  throughout  the  service 
might  be  strengthened  and  refreshed  thereby.  After  the  Priest  had  pro- 
nounced the  final  Benediction  upon  the  people,  he  and  the  Deacon  de- 
scended from  the  Sanctuary,  and  sitting  down  with  the  people,  they  con- 
sumed with  them  the  food  which  had  thus  been  blessed.  During  this  time 
selections  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  or  from  the  Epistles,  were  read 
aloud.  This  custom  is  still  observed  in  certain  monasteries,  notably  in 
those  on  Mount  Athos.  The  distribution  of  the  blessed  bread  during 
Grand  Matins,  to  the  Faithful  who  have  received  the  benediction  by  the 
anointing  with  the  blessed  oil,  commemorates  this  in  ordinary  churches. 

II. 

MATINS. 

(1 )  Thereby  expressing  that  those  present,  in  their  prayers,  have  sincere 
faith  and  love  towards  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  like  the  Wise  Men,  who 


APPENDIX  В  595 

brought  unto  him  offerings  of  frankincense  and  myrrh,  and  so  honoured 
God  in  the  flesh. 

(2)  The  Six  Psalms  represent  the  wretched  condition  of  the  human  race 
in  the  Old  Testament  days,  which  the  Offices  preceding  the  Divine  Liturgy 
chiefly  set  forth;  and  the  hope  of  a  Saviour  from  on  high. 

(3)  When  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  revealed  himself  to  the  people  as- 
sembled beside  the  Jordan,  John  the  Baptist  hailed  him  with  joy  and 
reverence.  Therefore  the  Priest,  or  the  Deacon,  now  solemnly  makes 
proclamation,  beholding,  as  it  were,  our  Lord  himself  come  to  minister  to 
the  world. 

(4)  During  Fasts  Alleluia  is  sung  four  times  instead  of:  "God  is  the 
Lord  and  hath  revealed  himself  unto  us." 

(5)  Thereby  reminding  us  of  the  time  when  the  Holy  Women  bearing 
spices,  and  other  Disciples  of  the  Lord,  came  early  to  his  sepulchre,  even 
before  the  dawn,  and  there  learning  of  our  Saviour's  Resurrection,  im- 
parted to  his  remaining  Disciples  the  glad  tidings.  The  incense  typifies 
the  sweet  spices  which  the  women  brought  to  the  tomb  of  the  Lord;  the 
taper  typifies  the  light  and  joy  of  the  glad  tidings  of  the  Resurrection,  and 
the  light  of  faith  therein,  and  in  our  future  life.  The  procession  of  the 
Priest  about  the  Temple  typifies  the  return  of  the  Holy  Women  and  the 
Disciples  from  the  sepulchre  of  the  Saviour,  bringing  the  tidings  to  the 
remaining  Disciples. 

(6)  It  is  so  called  from  the  Greek  words  poll  (much)  and  elea  (oil  or 
mercy) ;  because  the  latter  word  —  mercy  —  is  frequently  repeated  in 
these  Psalms;  and  from  the  lighting  of  the  shrine-lamps  filled  with  pure 
oil,  while  the  Psalms  are  being  sung. 

(7)  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  after  that  he  was  risen  from  the  dead,  speed- 
ily manifested  himself  to  his  Disciples.  Wherefore  the  Church,  by  the 
reading  of  the  Gospel  after  the  Song  of  the  Holy  Women,  announces  to  the 
People  one  of  the  ten  Manifestations  of  the  risen  Saviour  to  his  Disciples. 
The  appointed  Gospels  for  Matins  in  their  order  will  be  found  on  p.  xxi. 
All  the  eleven  Lessons  from  the  Gospels,  appointed  to  be  read  in  rotation, 
refer  to  the  Resurrection  of  our  Lord  on  the  third  day. 

(8)  While  the  Choir  sings,  the  Priest  and  Deacon  first  salute  the  Holy 
Gospels.  And  after  them  the  people,  in  the  presence  of  the  Priest,  as  it 
were  of  the  Angel-Messenger  of  the  Resurrection,  joyfully  do  homage  to 
the  Holy  Book,  as  to  Christ  himself,  and  kiss  it,  in  that  it  contains  the  re- 
deeming tidings  of  the  Resurrection. 

(9)  On  Feast  Days,  the  holy  image  of  the  Feast  or  of  the  Saint  is 
saluted  in  token  of  devotion  and  gratitude  to  God  for  his  mercy;  and  the 
Priest  bestows  the  blessing,  signing  each  one  of  the  Faithful  on  the  brow, 
in  the  form  of  a  cross  (with  the  oil  which  has  been  blessed  at  the  Vespers) 
in  the  Name  of  the  Holy  Trinity,  for  the  enlightenment  and  sanctification 
of  their  minds  and  hearts,  and  protection  against  all  evil. 


596  APPENDIX  В 

(ю)  As  joy  expresses  itself  in  song,  so  the  Holy  Church  has  appointed 
to  be  sung,  after  the  salutation  of  the  Book  of  the  Gospels,  the  Nine  Songs 
of  the  Canon,  which  represent  the  Hymns  of  praise,  at  the  Resurrection, 
of  the  nine  Ranks  of  the  heavenly  Hierarchy.  The  Canon  contains,  also, 
the  Hymns  of  those  godly  persons  in  the  Old  Testament,  from  Moses  to 
Zacharias,  who  magnified  the  Lord  God  in  spiritual  songs.  This  is  in 
conformity  with  the  teachings  of  our  Lord  himself,  who,  after  his 
Resurrection,  expounded  unto  his  Disciples  the  things  in  all  the  Scrip- 
tures concerning  himself;  and  each  Song  (Irmos),  in  the  vast  number  of 
Canons  in  the  Holy  Orthodox  Church,  is  inspired  by  the  Hymn  of  Scripture 
appointed  to  precede  it.  But  these  Scripture  hymns  are  generally  omit- 
ted, with  the  exception  of  the  Song  of  the  Holy  Birth-giver  of  God,  which 
precedes  Song  IX.  Many  of  the  Hymns  which  follow  each  song  are  also 
sometimes  omitted.  The  second  Hymn  of  Holy  Scripture  (Deuteron- 
omy xxxiii.)  is  not,  properly  speaking,  so  much  a  hymn  as  a  denunciation 
of  God's  judgments  upon  the  Israelites.  Therefore  it  is  said  only  on  the 
Tuesdays  of  the  Great  Fast.  In  imitation  of  this,  the  Second  Song  of 
every  Canon  also  consists  of  denunciations  of  God's  wrath  upon  the  dis- 
obedient, and  is  also  omitted. 

(n)  The  Hymns  of  Light  {Svyetilny)  are  also  called  the  "Exaposti- 
larion";  "Hymns  of  Light,"  because  their  subject  is  chiefly  the  illumi- 
nation of  the  soul  from  on  high,  and  because  the  singing  of  them  at 
Matins  precedes  the  break  of  day  and  the  Gloria  in  excelsis;  "Exaposti- 
larion, "  because  in  ancient  times  a  chanter  was  sent  out  into  the  centre  of 
the  church  to  sing  them.     (Greek:  Exapostildrion,  one  who  is  sent  forth.) 

(12)  In  ancient  times  the  singing  of  the  Canon  lasted  until  the  dawn. 
Therefore  it  is  still  the  custom,  at  the  present  day,  for  the  Priest,  shortly 
after  the  Canon  is  finished,  to  make  this  Exclamation,  in  an  outburst  of 
joy  and  thanksgiving,  beholding,  as  it  were,  the  dawn  of  day. 

III. 

THE  HOURS. 

In  the  First  Hour  we  thank  God  for  the  light  of  day  which  he  has  given 
to  us,  and  pray  him  that  we  may  pass  the  day  without  sin.  According  to 
the  ecclesiastical  reckoning,  the  First  Hour  corresponds  with  the  present 
seven  o'clock  in  the  morning. 

In  the  Third  Hour  we  commemorate  the  Descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
upon  the  Apostles  on  the  day  of  Pentecost.  It  corresponds  to  the  present 
nine  o'clock  in  the  morning. 

In  the  Sixth  Hour,  corresponding  to  twelve  o'clock  (noon),  the  Cruci- 
fixion of  Jesus  Christ  is  commemorated. 

The  Ninth  Hour,  corresponding  to  three  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  com- 
memorates the  death  of  Jesus  Christ,  our  Lord. 


APPENDIX  В  597 

The  Hours  for  Easter  consist  of  the  Hymns  only,  all  the  Psalms  being 
omitted. 

The  Imperial  Hours,  used  at  Christmas  and  Good  Friday,  consist  of  all 
the  Hours,  and  special  Psalms,  read  consecutively;  each  Hour  being  aug- 
mented by  the  reading  of  Lessons  from  the  Old  Testament,  from  the  Epis- 
tles, and  from  the  Gospels,  and  the  singing  of  special  Hymns. 

The  Typical  Psalms  in  their  prayers  and  songs  typify  the  Divine  Lit- 
urgy. They  are  sometimes  used  in  place  of  the  Liturgy.  They  are  also 
used  as  the  continuation  and  conclusion  of  the  Hours  (during  the  Great 
Fast),  and  of  the  Imperial  Hours. 

IV 

THE  LITURGY:  ST.  JOHN  CHRYSOSTOM,  ST.  BASIL,  PONTIFICAL. 

(i)  As  the  Sanctuary  symbolically  represents  the  kingdom  of  heaven, 
the  drawing  aside  of  the  curtain  during  Divine  Services  typifies,  in  gen- 
eral, the  revelation  to  mankind  of  the  mysteries  of  salvation,  which  had 
been  hidden  from  the  foundation  of  the  world  and  were  revealed  at  the 
incarnation  of  the  Lord;  through  whom,  also,  was  revealed  unto  men  the 
kingdom  of  heaven,  forfeited  by  our  first  parents.  The  opening  of  the 
Holy  Door  typifies,  in  general,  the  opening  of  the  way  to  the  places  where 
the  Saviour  of  the  world  abode,  or  of  the  gates  of  Paradise;  and,  some- 
times, the  entrance  into  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

(2)  They  thus  ask  forgiveness  for  any  offences  which  they  may  have 
committed  against  their  fellow-men;  and  the  Choirs  and  the  People  ex- 
press their  pardon  by  bowing  in  return. 

(3)  All  this  and  the  whole  Office  of  Oblation  are  said  while  the  clergy 
are  vesting,  in  a  low  voice,  by  the  Priest,  behind  the  image-screen  (ikono- 
stds),  which  corresponds  to  the  chancel-rail  in  the  Western  Church.  At 
the  point  duly  indicated,  after  the  Priest  and  Deacon  have  vested  them- 
selves, the  Reader  (in  front  of  the  image-screen),  begins  to  read  the  Hours; 
the  Priest  (behind  the  image-screen),  making  aloud  the  exclamations  and 
benedictions,  as  shown  in  the  Hours. 

(4)  Five  prosfori  are  generally  used  in  preparing  the  holy  Communion, 
in  commemoration  of  the  five  loaves  wherewith  our  Lord  fed  the  five 
thousand  people.  But  any  one  who  wishes  to  have  a  living  or  a  dead 
friend  prayed  for  at  the  appointed  place  in  the  Liturgy,  sends  to  the 
Chapel  of  Oblation  a  similar  prosford  (an  Altar-bread,  —  that  is,  "an  offer- 
ing"), with  the  Christian  name  only  of  the  person  written  on  a  paper,  or 
in  a  book  kept  for  that  purpose.  At  the  end  of  the  Liturgy  the  prosford  is 
returned  to  the  sender,  a  particle  having  been  removed,  in  token  that  the 
offering  has  been  accepted.  But  the  particles  thus  taken  from  these  pri- 
vate offerings  for  the  living  and  the  dead  do  not  form  a  part  of  the  Com- 
munion, because  they  are  not  transubstantiated.  The  Ruler  and  the 
Government,  the  Holy  Synod,  or  Patriarch,  and  other  persons  in  author- 
ity are  prayed  for  here  and  at  other  points  in  the  service  (which  explains 


598  APPENDIX  В 

the  frequent  recurrence  of  those  petitions),  not  only  in  their  official  capa- 
city, but  also  as  representing  benefactors  of  the  Church  and  the  people  in 
general.  In  the  early  Church  people  brought  bread,  wine,  oil  and  the 
other  things  required  for  the  sustentation  of  the  Church  and  for  the  ser- 
vices, on  behalf  of  themselves  or  of  living  friends,  or  as  memorials  of  their 
dead  friends;  and  all  such  persons  were  prayed  for,  in  detail,  by  name. 
With  the  growth  of  the  Church  this  special  mention  of  innumerable  indi- 
viduals became  burdensome,  and  rendered  the  services  oppressively  long. 
Therefore  the  present  abbreviated  and  representative  form  (the  Rulers) 
was  adopted. 

(5)  The  Altar,  which  represents  the  tomb  of  Christ  and  the  throne  of 
God,  the  holy  pictures  {ikoni —  images),  and  the  People  are  censed  by 
the  Deacon  at  the  end  of  the  Office  of  Oblation,  in  order  that  the  Faithful 
may  thereby  be  incited  to  a  more  fervent  offering  up  of  prayers.  The 
withdrawal  of  the  curtain  here  typifies  the  revelation  to  the  world  of  the 
secrets  of  salvation,  hidden  from  eternity. 

(6)  These  words,  and  the  briefer  form,  the  "Eis  polla  eti,  Despota," 
at  Pontifical  services,  as  well  as  the  "Axios"  and  "Kyrie  eleison"  in  the 
Ordination  Offices,  are  retained  in  the  original  Greek  as  an  acknowledg- 
ment of  the  Russian  Church's  origin  in  and  oneness  with  the  Greek  Church. 

(7)  This  opening  of  the  Holy  Door  signifies  that  the  heavens  were 
opened  at  the  Baptism  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  a  voice  proceeding 
thence  testified  to  him.  The  Little  Entrance  typifies  the  entrance  of  our 
Lord  upon  his  work  of  preaching  to  the  world,  and  his  drawing  near  to  men. 
The  book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  represents  Christ  our  Lord,  and  the  taper 
borne  before  it  signifies  that  the  teaching  of  the  Gospels  —  that  is,  our 
Lord  himself  —  is  the  Light  of  the  world.  He  who  bears  the  taper  rep- 
resents John  the  Baptist.  The  censer,  with  its  glowing  embers,  typifies 
the  Divine  Ember,  Christ  himself,  the  God-Man,  who  united  himself  to 
mortal  flesh,  and,  burning  with  divine  love  towards  the  human  race,  did 
utterly  consume  himself  upon  the  altar  of  the  Cross,  in  the  savour  of  a 
sweet  fragrance  unto  the  everlasting  Father. 

(8)  The  exclamation,  "Wisdom,  O  believers!"  always  has  the  object 
of  calling  the  people's  attention  to  some  especially  edifying  or  sacred  por- 
tions of  the  service.  "Wisdom!"  points  directly  to  this  edifying  lesson, 
hymn  or  action. 

(9)  The  Thrice-Holy  is  sung  as  follows :  First  the  Choir  sings  the  whole 
hymn  thrice.  Then:  "Glory  .  now,  and  ever,  .  .  Holy  Immortal  One, 
have  mercy  upon  us."    Then  the  whole  hymn,  very  slowly. 

(10)  This  hymn  is  sung  in  the  same  manner  as  the  preceding.  It  is 
used  at  these  Feasts  because,  in  the  early  Church,  converts  to  Chris- 
tianity were  chiefly  baptized  at  these  seasons.  By  its  use  at  the  present 
day,  the  holy  Church  reminds  us  that  we  are  bound  to  fulfil  the  vows  made 
for  us  in  Baptism. 


APPENDIX  В  599 

(n)  The  Bishop  takes  his  seat  upon  the  "High  Place,"  or  Throne,  be- 
cause he  represents  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 

(12)  The  Gradual  (Prokimen),  a  verse  which  precedes  the  Lesson  of 
Scripture,  is  sung  thus:  The  Reader  reads  it;  the  Choir  sings  it.  The 
Reader  reads  the  Verse,  or  Verses,  while  the  Choir  repeats  the  Gradual 
proper.  The  Reader  then  reads  the  first  half  of  the  Gradual,  and  the  Choir 
sings  the  last  half. 

(13)  This  censing  of  the  Temple,  in  preparation  for  listening  to  the 
reading  of  the  Holy  Gospel,  draws  the  thoughts  of  the  worshippers  on 
high,  and  typifies  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  which  is  shed  abroad  in  all 
the  world,  giving  to  the  heart  of  man  the  savour  of  the  sweetness  of  Christ 
(2  Cor.  ii.  15).  It  is  also  a  sign  of  prayerful  reverence  and  homage  to  the 
Holy  Gospel,  as  a  symbol  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  which  is  bestowed  upon  the 
world  through  the  Gospel. 

(14)  If  there  is  to  be  a  sermon,  the  Priest  may  preach  it  immediately 
after  the  reading  of  the  Gospel,  or  at  the  end  of  the  Liturgy. 

(15)  After  this  clear  announcement  of  God's  Word  in  Christ,  it  is  meet 
and  right  that  men  should  repeat  their  petitions,  and  pray  to  him  with 
redoubled  fervour  for  all  things  necessary  both  for  their  souls  and  bodies. 
Therefore  it  is  ordered  that  the  Litany  of  Fervent  Supplication  shall  now  be 
said. 

(16)  The  Catechumens  in  the  early  Church  were  not  considered  to  be 
sufficiently  instructed  to  look  upon  the  Holy  Mysteries  without  incur- 
ring the  danger  of  misunderstanding  them. 

(17)  In  the  middle  of  the  Cherubimic  Hymn  the  Great  "Entrance  is  made  : 
that  is  to  say,  the  Holy  Gifts  are  brought  from  the  Chapel  (or  Table)  of 
Oblation  to  the  Altar.  In  the  days  of  the  early  Church,  during  this  Great 
Entrance,  all  persons  who  had  brought  or  sent  offerings  for  the  use  of  the 
Church  were  mentioned  by  name.  But  as  this  detailed  commemoration 
was  extremely  long  and  difficult,  it  was  ordered  that  only  the  chief  per- 
sonages in  rank  and  power  should  thereafter  be  mentioned  by  name;  all 
others  being  included  under  the  honourable  title  of  "all  Orthodox  Chris- 
tians." If  it  be  a  Pontifical  Liturgy,  the  Bishop  washes  his  hands  at  this 
point,  thus  ceremonially  purifying  himself  for  the  sacred  office  which  he  is 
about  to  exercise. 

The  Great  Entrance  typifies  our  Lord's  going  to  his  Passion  and  death. 
Therefore  it  is  customary  for  the  Faithful  to  do  homage  to  the  Holy 
Gifts  at  this  point,  although  these  are  not  yet  consecrated. 

(18)  In  the  early  Church  the  Deacons,  Sub-Deacons  and  Sacristans 
were  wont  to  guard  the  doors,  that  no  heathen  or  unworthy  person  might 
enter  in,  and  that  no  one  should  go  out  during  the  solemn  celebration  of 
the  Holy  Sacrament.  At  the  present  time,  the  words,  "The  Doors!"  warn 
us  to  guard  the  doors  of  our  souls  against  all  evil  thoughts,  as  we  prepare 
to  confess  our  faith  by  the  Creed,  and  to  give  heed  to  the  Holy  Mysteries. 


6oo  APPENDIX  В 

(19)  The  Deacon  here  binds  his  stole  about  him  in  the  form  of  a  cross, 
to  represent  the  wings  of  the  Cherubim,  who  stand  about  the  throne  of 
God;  as  he  himself  represents  an  angel. 

(20)  The  Greek  letters:  ИС,  XC;  N1,  KA  mean:  Jesus  Christ  the  Con- 
queror. 

(21)  The  sacred  warm  water  represents  the  water  which  came  forth 
from  the  side  of  our  Lord,  with  the  Blood,  showing  that,  although  he  was 
dead,  his  Body  was  not  devoid  of  divine  virtue;  that  is,  the  warmth  and 
vitality  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  union  of  the  Holy  Elements  is  symbolical 
of  our  Lord's  Resurrection. 

(22)  All  persons,  both  Infants  and  Adults,  are  communicated  alike; 
that  is  to  say,  with  the  mingled  holy  Body  and  Blood,  by  the  sacred  spoon. 
Infants  receive  the  holy  Communion  by  virtue  of  their  having  received 
holy  Chrismation  immediately  following  their  Baptism,  which  holy  Chris- 
mation  makes  them  full  members  of  the  Church.  Until  they  reach  the  age 
of  seven  years  they  receive  the  holy  Communion  without  the  (otherwise) 
indispensable  preface  of  the  Sacrament  of  Confession. 

(23)  This  represents  the  appearances  of  our  Lord  to  his  Disciples  after 
his  Resurrection;  also  his  Ascension  into  heaven. 

(24)  The  Antidoron  (literally,  "in  place  of  the  Gifts")  consists  of  that 
part  of  the  first  Altar-bread  which  remains  on  the  Table  of  Oblation  after 
the  Sacred  Lamb  has  been  taken  therefrom  to  be  consecrated.  It  came  to 
be  the  custom  to  distribute  this  blessed  bread  from  the  following  causes: 
First,  it  was  given  as  a  memorial  of  those  Love-feasts  which  were  held,  in 
ancient  times,  immediately  after  the  Divine  Liturgy;  and  again,  it  was 
given  to  Christians  in  place  of  the  Holy  Gifts  (as  its  name  indicates), 
when  they  came  fasting  to  the  Liturgy,  but  had  not  prepared  themselves, 
by  reason  of  human  frailty,  to  receive  the  holy  Sacrament.  Sometimes 
the  last  two  breads  are  brought  out  (after  the  prescribed  particles  have 
been  removed)  at  the  end  of  the  service,  and  given  to  persons  of  distinction 
who  may  be  present. 

V. 

THE  OFFICE  OF  THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  OF  THE  PRESANC- 

TIFIED  (GIFTS). 

(1)  At  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  (Gifts),  there  is  no  consecration 
of  the  Sacred  Elements,  but  those  who  desire  to  communicate  receive  the 
Holy  Gifts  which  have  been  consecrated  at  a  previous  service. 

It  is  used  only  during  the  Great  Fast  {Lent),  on  Wednesdays  and  Fridays; 
in  the  fifth  week  of  Great  Fast,  on  Thursday;  and  in  Passion  (Holy)  Week, 
on  Monday,  Tuesday  and  Wednesday.  It  was  instituted  in  the  first  ages  of 
Christianity,  but  received  its  present  form  from  Gregory  the  Great, 
Bishop  of  Rome  in  the  sixth  century. 

The  Fathers  of  the  Church  regarded  it  as  unbefitting  the  contrition  of 
Lent  that  the  full  Liturgy  (of  St.  John  Chrysostom  or  of  St.  Basil  the 


APPENDIX  В  6oi 

Great)  should  be  celebrated.  Therefore  the  complete  Liturgy  is  allowed 
during  the  Great  Fast  only  on  Saturday,  Sunday,  the  Feast  of  the  Annun- 
ciation, and  Holy  Thursday-  The  Sacred  Elements  are  consecrated  at 
the  Liturgy  on  those  days,  and  thereafter  are  preserved  in  the  tabernacle, 
on  the  holy  Altar. 

The  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  consists  of  Vespers,  with  special  Prayers 
together  with  a  portion  of  the  ordinary  Liturgy,  omitting  its  most  impor- 
tant part,  namely,  the  consecration  of  the  Holy  Gifts;  and  the  Third, 
Sixth  and  Ninth  Hours  (with  the  Typical  Psalms)  are  used  in  a  particular 
manner  at  the  beginning. 

(2)  The  Mineya  is  a  set  of  twelve  volumes  containing  the  services  for 
every  day  in  the  year,  with  the  proper  Hymns  for  the  Saints  of  the  day, 
and  so  forth.  In  addition,  there  are  the  Mineya  of  the  Feasts,  and  the 
Pentecostarion  (with  the  services  for  Easter-tide) ;  and  the  Tri6dion, 
which  contains  the  services,  day  by  day,  for  the  Great  Fast. 

(3)  The  Priest  by  his  exclamation  sets  forth,  as  it  were,  that  our  fore- 
fathers the  Prophets,  from  whose  writings  we  have  heard  and  shall  hear 
Lessons,  were  illumined  by  the  same  light  which  still  enlightens  all  men. 

(4)  As  in  the  early  Church  there  were  always  some  among  the  Cate- 
chumens who  were  soon  to  be  baptized  (illumined),  that  is  to  say,  in 
Easter  week,  this  special  Litany  was  inserted  for  them  in  the  Liturgy  of 
the  Presanctified  (where  alone  it  is  used)  after  Mid-Fast,  or  the  Adoration 
of  the  Cross.  But  on  Saturdays  and  Sundays,  at  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John 
Chrysostom,  or  of  St.  Basil  the  Great,  it  is  not  used. 

(5)  At  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts,  after  the  Grand  Entrance, 
the  curtain  is,  as  a  rule,  not  completely,  but  only  half  drawn;  because  it  is 
fully  drawn  at  the  full  Liturgy  after  the  Grand  Entrance.  The  Entrance 
commemorates  the  Lord's  going  to  his  suffering,  which  is  the  inconceiv- 
able mystery  of  men's  salvation,  and  had  been  hid  from  many  ages  and 
generations  (Col.  i.  26).  At  this  time  the  Presanctified  Gifts  are  on  the 
Altar,  and  the  people  (when  the  curtain  is  drawn  aside),  beholding  the 
sacrifice  offered  for  the  sins  of  the  world,  with  boldness  call  upon  God,  the 
heavenly  Father,  and  say:  "Our  Father." 

(6)  At  the  Liturgy  of  the  Presanctified  Gifts  there  is  no  elevation  of 
the  Body  of  Christ;  because,  as  it  represents  the  elevation  of  the  Lord 
upon  the  Cross,  it  has  already  been  made  during  the  Liturgy  at  which  the 
Gifts  were  consecrated'. 

VI- 
THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  BAPTISM  AND  HOLY  CHRISMATION. 
(1)  It  will  be  observed  that  this  rite  remains  in  its  ancient  form;  that 
is  to  say,  as  arranged  for  adults  —  the  Catechumens  being  all  adults  in 
the  early  Church. 

The  removal  of  the  Catechumen's  garment  signifies  the  putting  off  of 


602  APPENDIX  В 

the  old  man  and  of  his  sinful  life,  inasmuch  as  this  Order  is  required  only 
in  the  baptism  of  adults;  that  is,  of  persons  above  seven  years  of  age,  who 
are  received  only  after  due  examination  and  their  own  expressed  desire  to 
be  baptized.  With  such,  also,  the  procedure  differs,  according  as  they 
may  be  Jews,  Mahometans,  or  members  of  some  other  non-Christian 
body;  in  which  case,  each  must  specifically  renounce  the  errors  of  his 
former  belief.  But  the  rite  is  alike  for  all  Infants  (that  is,  persons  under 
seven  years  of  age),  whether  they  be  of  Orthodox  or  non-Orthodox  parents; 
and  of  them,  through  their  Sponsor,  only  the  third  catechizing,  to  which 
the  answer  is  the  Symbol  of  the  Faith  (the  Nicene  Creed),  is  required. 

Three  tapers  are  lighted  and  placed  upon  the  font  itself  to  typify  the 
Holy  Trinity,  in  whose  name  Baptism  is  administered.  The  Sponsors 
also  hold  tapers,  to  signify  their  faith  in  the  illumination  which  the  Holy 
Mystery  (Sacrament)  confers  upon  the  soul  of  the  person  baptized:  that 
the  baptized  person  passes  from  darkness  into  light,  and  becomes  a  child 
of  the  light.      For  this  reason,  also,  Baptism  is  called  "Illumination." 

The  font  typifies  Noah's  ark. 

Holy  Baptism  is  a  Sacrament  through  which  a  man  is  born  once  only 
in  spiritual  birth;  therefore  it  is  not  repeated,  if  it  has  been  regularly  per- 
formed, through  triple  immersion,  in  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the 
Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  whether  it  has  previously  been  performed  or 
not,  the  formula  "if  not  already  baptized"  must  be  interpolated.  The 
rule  is  that  it  shall  be  administered  in  church;  but  in  case  of  necessity  it 
may  be  administered  in  a  private  house.  In  extremity,  a  layman  may 
baptize;  and  the  Baptism  is  not  repeated,  though  the  Chrismation  is 
afterwards  performed,  if  the  child  live.  Though  immersion  is  prescribed,  a 
child  may  be  baptized  by  affusion  in  case  of  extreme  weakness  or  mortal 
danger;  and  those  baptized  by  affusion  in  such  cases  (or  persons  who  have 
been  so  baptized  in  other  Christian  Churches,  when  they  join  the  Eastern 
Catholic  Church)  are  not  rebaptized,  but  are  only  anointed  with  the 
holy  Chrism. 

It  is  not  customary  for  either  father  or  mother  to  be  present  at  the 
baptism;  though  it  is  not  forbidden  for  the  father.  Provided  forty  days 
have  elapsed  since  the  birth  of  the  child,  the  mother  is  permitted  to  be 
present. 

For  a  man  or  boy,  one  sponsor  (male)  not  younger  than  fifteen  years  of 
age  is  indispensable.  For  a  woman  or  girl  one  female  sponsor  not  younger 
than  thirteen  years  of  age  is  indispensable.  The  Church  does  not  forbid 
other  sponsors.  The  sponsor  ought  to  be  a  member  of  the  Holy  Orthodox 
Apostolic  Church  of  the  East;  but  if  a  member  of  another  Church  should, 
for  any  reason,  stand  sponsor,  he  (she)  is  required  to  recite  the  Symbol  of 
the  Faith  of  the  Orthodox  Church.  In  such  case  a  non-Orthodox  man  or 
woman  may  stand  as  additional  sponsor.

(2)  That  is  to  say,  endowed  with  reason  and  speech,  in  contradistinction 
to  the  dumb  animals. 

(3)  From  the  west  comes  darkness;  and  Satan,  who  is  darkness,  and 
whom  the  Catechumen  must  renounce,  has  his  dominion  there.  The  up- 
lifted hands  of  the  Catechumen  indicate  the  realm  of  the  evil  spirits  of  the 
air. 

(4)  The  Catechumen  turns  his  face  to  the  east,  because  light  proceeds 
thence.  The  white  vestments  and  the  lights  typify  spiritual  joy  in  the 
illumination  of  the  person  through  holy  Baptism. 

(5)  This  is  called  "the  oil  of  gladness"  because  the  person  baptized  is 
thereby  engrafted  into  the  good  olive-tree,  Jesus  Christ,  having  been,  as 
it  were,  a  branch  wrested  from  a  wild  olive-tree.  As  the  Lord  sent  to  the 
people  in  Noah's  ark  a  twig  of  olive  by  a  dove,  in  token  of  reconciliation 
and  salvation,  so  the  sign  of  the  cross  is  made  above  the  water  with  the  oil, 
in  token  that  the  waters  of  baptism  serve  to  reconcile  man  with  God, 
through  the  mercy  of  God  therein  manifested,  and  save  from  the  taint  of 
sin  (Rom.  xi.  17). 

(6)  Anointment  with  the  holy  Chrism  (Chrismation)  is  a  Sacrament 
whereby  the  recipient,  through  the  anointing  of  various  parts  of  the  body 
in  the  name  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  receives  the  gifts  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  to  rear 
and  strengthen  him  in  the  spiritual  life,  and  to  render  him  strong,  firm  and 
invincible  in  faith,  in  love  and  hope;  in  boldness,  that  without  fear  he 
may  confess  before  all  men  the  name  of  Christ:  that  he  may  grow  in  all 
virtues,  free  himself  from  the  Evil  One  and  all  his  guile,  and  preserve  his 
soul  in  purity  and  righteousness  (1  John  ii.  20;  2  Cor.  i.  21,  22).  After 
anointment  with  the  holy  Chrism  the  child  is  a  member  of  Christ's  Church, 
and  receives  the  holy  Communion,  without  preliminary  confession,  until 
he  reaches  the  age  of  seven  years.  Beginning  with  that  age  confession  is 
obligatory. 

(7)  The  circle  typifies  eternity.  Therefore  the  triple,  circling  of  the 
font  with  lighted  tapers  signifies  that  the  newly  baptized  (illumined)  per- 
son has  entered  into  eternal  union  with  Christ,  the  Light  of  the  world. 

(8)  The  three  Offices  —  (a)  Prayers  at  the  Reception  of  a  Catechumen ; 
(b)  Holy  Baptism  and  Chrismation ;  and  (c)  Ablution,  which  were  formerly 
celebrated  separately  —  are  now  commonly  joined  together  in  one  ser- 
vice. In  the  early  Church  the  Catechumen  wore  his  robe  of  purity  for 
eight  days,  which  he  spent  in  fasting  and  prayer. 

(q)  The  words  of  the  Apostle  (1  Cor.  vi.  11). 

(10)  The  shearing  of  the  hair  signifies  that  the  newly  baptized  person 
has  dedicated  himself  to  the  service  of  God,  and  to  obedience;  because 
the  cutting  of  the  hair  has  always  been  the  symbol  of  submission  and 
servitude.  It  is  also  symbolical  of  the  scriptural  offering  of  the  first- 
fruits.

VII. 

THE  RITE  OF  HOLY  MATRIMONY, 
(i)  Tapers  are  given  to  those  who  plight  their  troth  and  to  bridal  pairs 
to  symbolize  the  purity  of  their  lives,  which  shine  with  the  light  of  virtue 
(John  iii.  20-21).  The  morning,  immediately  after  the  celebration  of 
the  Divine  Liturgy,  is  regarded  by  the  Church  as  the  proper  time  for  the 
solemnization  of  Marriage  (although  this  time  is  not  obligatory),  in  order 
that  the  bridal  pair  may  receive  this  Sacrament  fasting.  The  rite  is  not 
solemnized  on  all  days  of  the  year,  but  is  forbidden  during  Fasts;  on  the 
Eves  of  Great  Feasts;  during  Easter  week;  and  on  some  other  days. 

(2)  The  rubric  prescribes  a  gold  ring  for  the  man,  to  typify  his  greater 
worth  and  authority;  and  a  silver  ring  for  the  woman,  to  typify  her  scrip- 
tural subjection  to  her  husband,  as  the  head  of  the  wife.  In  modern  prac- 
tice the  rings  are,  as  a  rule,  both  of  gold;  and  the  bridal  pair  themselves 
make  the  prescribed  exchange  in  the  Russian  Church,  but  not  in  the 
Greek  Church. 

(3)  It  is  customary,  at  the  beginning  of  this  Office,  to  lead  the  bridal 
pair  upon  a  piece  of  new,  rose-coloured  material  (or  a  new  rug),  which  is 
spread  before  the  lectern.  In  olden  days  the  Russian  Tzars  and  their 
brides  were  led  upon  a  piece  of  flowered  silken  material  and  sable  skins 
(sometimes  as  many  as  forty  in  number),  which  were  intended  as  emblems 
of  happiness  and  plenty  in  the  new  path  upon  which  they  were  entering. 
This  is  the  significance  in  general. 

(4)  The  crowns  represent  the  honour  and  reward  bestowed  upon  the 
wedded  pair  for  the  purity  of  their  lives.  In  Greece  the  crowns  are  woven 
of  olive  leaves  (emblematic  of  fruitfulness),  or  of  laurel,  interwined  with 
flowers.  But  in  Russia,  metal  crowns  are  kept  in  the  churches.  They 
are  adorned  with  holy  pictures  (ikoni);  that  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
being  upon  the  crown  of  the  bridegroom,  and  that  of  his  holy  Mother  upon 
that  of  the  bride. 

(5)  Wine  is  used  in  the  Sacrament  of  Marriage,  because  at  the  mar- 
riage in  Cana  of  Galilee,  which  our  Lord  blessed  with  his  presence,  the 
water  converted  into  wine  by  a  miracle  was  served.  The  "common 
cup"  of  weal  and  woe  is  given  to  the  bride  and  bridegroom  in  token  that 
they  ought  to  dwell  in  unbroken  concord,  hold  and  use,  undivided,  their 
acquisitions,  and  share  equally  the  cup  of  joy  and  sorrow.  In  Greece 
they  are  given  bread  soaked  in  wine,  having  the  same  significance. 

(6)  The  circle  typifies  eternity.  By  this  circling  round  the  lectern, 
upon  which  lie  the  book  of  the  Gospels  and  the  cross,  the  bridal  pair  sig- 
nify their  oath  forever  to  preserve  their  marriage  bond,  until  death  shall 
break  it.  The  triple  circling  is  in  honour  of  the  Holy  Trinity,  which  is 
invoked  to  bear  witness  to  their  oath. 

(7)  Saint  Constantine  and  Saint  Helena  are  invoked  because  they  were 


APPENDIX  В  605 

the  disseminators  (in  the  tenth  century)  of  the  Orthodox  faith;  and  Saint 
Procopius  is  invoked  because  he  instructed  the  twelve  women  to  go  to 
their  death  of  martyrdom  as  to  a  marriage  feast.  The  Exhortation  is 
generally  made  immediately  after  this  Benediction,  instead  of  at  the 
point  originally  prescribed.     (See  page  293.) 

(8)  In  the  early  Church,  the  crowns  (of  olive  leaves)  were  worn  for  a 
week. 

(9)  This  second  Order  of  Marriage  is  used  only  when  both  bride  and 
bridegroom  have  been  previously  wedded.  When  either  is  now  married 
for  the  first  time,  the  preceding  Order  is  used.  The  holy  Church  permits 
second  and  even  third  marriages,  but  unwillingly.  Nicephorus,  Patri- 
arch of  Constantinople,  commanded  that  persons  who  entered  into  a 
second  marriage  should  not  be  crowned,  and  should  be  deprived  of  the 
holy  Communion  for  the  space  of  two  years.  Persons  who  entered  into  a 
third  marriage  were  debarred  from  the  Communion  for  five  years.  This 
rule  is  not  observed  at  the  present  day,  but  explains  this  separate  Order 
for  Second  Marriage. 

VIII. 

ORDINATIONS. 

(1)  The  Sub-Deacon  in  his  service  typifies  the  service  of  the  angels. 
Accordingly,  at  his  ordination  he  is  invested  with  the  stole,  which  he  girds 
about  him  crosswise,  thereby  symbolizing  the  wings  with  which  the  Cher- 
ubim veil  their  faces  as  they  stand  before  the  throne  of  God. 

(2)  As  no  man  is  ordained  to  the  Diaconate  unless  he  be  already  a  Sub- 
Deacon,  it  is  now  customary  (if  he  be  not  already  a  Sub-Deacon)  to 
ordain  him  to  that  degree  on  the  same  day  upon  which  he  receives  the 
Laying-on  of  Hands  to  the  Diaconate.  As  he  cannot  marry  after  he  has 
received  this  degree  (of  Sub-Deacon),  he  must  be  already  married  if  he  is 
to  become  a  parish  priest;  that  is,  unless  he  has  elected  to  become  a  monk. 
As  he  does  not  celebrate  the  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist  but  only  serves 
at  it,  he  is  ordained  after  the  consecration  of  the  Holy  Gifts. 

(3)  The  first  "command"  is  addressed  to  the  people,  the  second  to  the 
clergy,  and  the  third  to  the  Bishop.  In  the  early  days  of  Christianity  the 
people  and  the  clergy  of  the  local  church  had  a  voice  in  the  election  of 
Bishops,  Priests  and  Deacons,  in  the  sense  that  the  choice  made  by  the 
Bishops  was  announced  to  them,  with  the  object  of  obtaining  their  tes- 
timony in  regard  to  the  qualities  of  the  candidates,  and  of  giving  them  an 
opportunity  to  declare  for  or  against  the  choice.  Later  on,  owing  to 
difficulties,  the  influence  of  the  people  upon  the  selection  of  their  Bishops 
was  restricted.  In  the  choice  of  Priests  and  Deacons  the  people  never  had 
as  much  to  say  as  in  that  of  their  Bishops.  The  "command "  addressed  to 
them  preserves  the  tradition  of  their  right  to  pronounce  upon  the  candi- 
date's fitness. 


боб  APPENDIX  В 

(4)  Hereby  he  announces  his  intention  to  devote  himself  always  to  the 
service  of  God's  altar. 

(5)  He  thereby  signifies  his  gratitude  and  respect  for  him  at  whose 
hands  the  grace  of  God  is  invoked  upon  him.  The  three  hymns  which 
are  chanted  while  he  is  making  this  triple  circuit  of  the  Altar  are  symbol- 
ical: The  Martyrs  invoked  in  the  first  are  to  serve  the  candidate  as  an 
example  for  the  preservation  of  his  faith  and  purity;  the  second  proclaims 
that  the  subject  of  the  candidate's  preaching  (like  that  of  the  Apostles 
and  Martyrs)  is  to  be  the  Trinity,  one  in  Essence  and  Undivided;  the 
third  denotes  that  the  foundation  of  the  priesthood  and  of  the  Church 
was  the  coming  of  the  Saviour,  who  must  be  magnified,  while  the  holy 
Virgin  is  blessed. 

(6)  In  token  that  the  fulness  of  the  sacred  ministry  is  not  conferred 
upon  the  Deacon,  but  only  a  portion  thereof. 

(7)  This  denotes  that  he  who  is  thus  receiving  Ordination  is  preparing 
himself  to  share  the  pastoral  burden. 

(8)  Kyrie  eleison  (Lord,  have  mercy),  like  Axios  (worthy),  is  left  in  the 
original  Greek,  in  order  to  show  whence  the  Russian  Church  derived  its 
Holy  Orders.  Axios  signifies  that  he  who  through  the  Laying-on  of  Hands 
has  received  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  is  become  worthy  to  perform  the 
sacred  office  entrusted  to  him. 

(9)  The  kissing  signifies  the  mutual  greeting  upon  the  entry  of  the  new 
ecclesiastic  upon  his  new  ministry,  and  the  love  and  union  of  all  the  par- 
ticipants. 

(10)  The  Ordination  of  a  Priest  takes  place  after  the  Holy  Gifts  have 
been  borne  from  the  Credence  Table  to  the  Altar,  in  order  that  he  may 
take  part  in  their  consecration.  In  token  that  he  is  finishing  his  service 
as  Deacon,  he  bears  the  air  (vozdukh)  on  his  head  during  the  Great  En- 
trance. He  kneels  at  the  Altar  on  both  knees,  to  denote  that  he  is  re- 
ceiving a  greater  ministry  and  a  higher  gift  than  the  Deacon.  The  rest 
of  the  symbolism  is  the  same  as  at  the  Ordination  of  a  Deacon. 

(11)  Because  the  Abbot  is  set  over  the  flock  of  God  in  the  Monastery, 
he  kisses  the  Bishop's  stole,  which  is  the  emblem  of  the  wandering  sheep 
that  the  Good  Shepherd  took  upon  his  shoulder,  and  which  the  Bishop 
wears  to  denote  his  charge  over  the  flock  of  Christ.  The  rest  of  the  sym- 
bolism is  the  same  as  at  the  Ordination  of  a  Deacon. 

THE  CONSECRATION  OR  ORDINATION  OF  A  BISHOP. 

(12)  This  "Eagle"  is  a  very  large  rug,  upon  which  is  depicted  a  single- 
headed  eagle  hovering  over  a  city  with  battlemented  walls  and  towers. 
Similar  rugs,  or  "eagles,"  of  a  smaller  size,  are  used  for  the  Bishop  (or 
more  exalted  Prelate)  to  stand  upon  when  he  celebrates  any  service.  The 
city  is  a  symbol  of  his  episcopal  authority  over  the  cities  of  his  diocese; 
the  eagle  symbolizes  his  pure  and  lofty  and  upright  theological  teaching. 


APPENDIX  В  607 

in  imitation  of  that  eagle  which  is  depicted  with  St.  John  the  Divine. 
The  same  significance  is  attached  to  the  halo  round  the  eagle's  head, 
which  typifies  theological  attainments  and  the  gift  of  grace. 

(13)  The  Consecration  takes  place  at  this  point  because  the  Little 
Entrance  typifies  the  coming  to  earth  of  the  Lord  incarnate,  who  suffered 
for  us,  and  rose  again,  and  was  received  up  into  heaven.  Thereafter  the 
Holy  Spirit  consecrated  the  first  successors  of  the  Saviour,  and  revealed 
them  as  enthroned  and  reigning  with  Christ.  Therefore,  when  the  Chief 
Bishop  enters  the  Sanctuary,  as  it  were  heaven,  with  the  other  ecclesias- 
tics, the  candidate  for  Consecration  is  led  thither,  and  the  Sacrament  of 
Laying-on  of  Hands  is  conferred  upon  him  before  they  all  take  their 
places  on  the  episcopal  thrones,  as  it  were  on  the  heavenly  thrones;  and 
thus  he,  also,  becomes  a  throned  Bishop,  and  sits  with  them  as  their 
equal. 

(14)  The  book  of  the  Gospels  represents  Christ  the  Lord,  the  source 
of  all  things.  It  is  placed  on  the  Bishop's  neck  to  show  that  he  should 
rule  his  flock  after  the  pattern  of  Christ,  bending  his  neck  lightly  under 
the  yoke  of  Christ,  and  must  do  nothing  contrary  to  His  will.  For  under 
the  form  of  the  Gospels  he  has  taken  upon  his  head  and  neck  the  Church 
of  the  Lord. 

(15)  Axios  is  said  only  when  the  omofor  or  Bishop's  stole  (pall)  is  laid 
upon  his  shoulders;  because  he  already  possesses  all  the  vestments  of  a 
Priest.  It  was  made  of  wool  in  former  days,  and  represents  the  wandering 
sheep  which  the  Good  Shepherd  found  and  laid  across  his  shoulders.  It 
is  adorned  with  crosses  to  signify  that,  as  Christ  bore  his  cross  upon  his 
shoulders,  so  all  who  desire  to  follow  him  must  bear  their  cross  on  their 
shoulders.  Many  traditions  quoted  by  ancient  writers  affirm  that  the 
clergy  and  all  the  people,  by  uttering  this  word  "Axios"  (worthy),  at  the 
Consecration  of  Bishops  and  at  the  Ordinations  of  Priests  and  Deacons, 
thereby  gave  their  testimony  to  the  blameless  life  and  good  morals  of  him 
who  had  received  the  laying-on  of  hands.  St.  Clement  instituted  in  the 
Primitive  Church,  in  the  name  of  the  Apostles,  a  law  that  such  testimony 
should  be  exacted  especially  at  the  Consecration  of  Bishops,  in  reply  to  the 
definite  question,  thrice  put  to  the  people:  "  Is  he,  in  truth,  worthy  of  this 
ministry?" 

IX. 

HOLY  UNCTION. 
(1)  Anointing  with  the  holy  Oil  is  a  Sacrament  in  which,  through  the 
anointing  of  the  body,  the  grace  of  God  is  invoked  upon  the  sick  person ; 
because  that  grace  heals  all  ills,  both  those  of  the  soul  and  those  of  the 
body.  It  is  performed  only  over  sick  persons  (James  v.  14,  15),  with  one 
exception:  In  the  Cathedral  of  the  Falling-asleep  of  the  Birth-giver  of  God 
(Assumption)  in  Moscow,  on  Holy  Thursday,  the  Bishop  anoints  all  per- 


6o8  APPENDIX  В 

sons  who  desire  it,  after  the  Divine  Liturgy;  because,  on  the  evening  of 
Great  and  Holy  Thursday  Christ  instituted  a  new  Covenant  with  his 
Body  and  Blood.  Therefore  it  is  not  unfitting  that  a  well  man  should 
partake  also  of  this  Sacrament,  since  he  knows  not  the  day  and  hour  of 
his  death.  The  warrant  for  this  is  the  saying  of  St.  James,  taken  in  its 
broadest  sense  to  include  those  who  surfer  from  spiritual  ills  —  grief,  de- 
spondency, and  the  like  —  as  well  as  from  those  of  the  body. 

The  sick  person  who  receives  this  Sacrament  must  be  of  the  Orthodox 
faith,  and  must  prepare  himself  by  repentance  and  confession;  and  before 
or  after  this  Sacrament  he  receives  the  Sacrament  of  the  Holy  Communion. 
Holy  Unction,  being  in  the  nature  of  a  healing  remedy,  may  be  repeated; 
and  even  the  young  need  not  fear  to  receive  it,  under  the  erroneous  im- 
pression that,  having  received  it,  they  cannot,  thenceforth,  eat  meat  or 
marry.  It  is  performed  in  church,  in  the  presence  of  an  assembly,  if  the 
sick  person  be  able  to  leave  his  bed;  or  at  home,  before  an  assembly  of 
people.  Seven  Priests  are  appointed  to  perform  it,  because  there  are 
seven  Lessons  from  the  Epistles,  seven  from  the  Gospels,  and  sever» 
Prayers;  the  number  seven  being  chosen  as  symbolical  of  the  Seven  Gifts 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  in  conformity  with  the  number  seven  connected 
with  the  Shunammite  woman's  child  and  Prophet  Elisha  (2  Kings  iv-  35);* 
of  the  reopening  of  the  skies  by  the  Prophet  Elijah,  after  they  had  been 
shut  up  for  three  years  and  a  half  (1  Kings  xviii.  43) ;  of  Naaman's  dipping 
himself  in  the  waters  of  the  Jordan,  after  which  he  was  cleansed.  But  in 
case  of  need  the  holy  Church  permits  one  Priest  to  perform  the  Office,  if  he 
does  so  in  the  name  of  the  whole  assembly-  A  shorter  form  of  the  Office 
is  appointed  for  use  over  those  in  danger  of  immediate  death.  Another 
name  for  the  Sacrament  is  "Prayer-Oil." 

(2)  Seven  tapers  are  lighted  round  about  the  shrine-lamp  or  other 
vessel  which  contains  the  wine  and  oil,  as  images  of  the  Seven  Gifts  of 
the  Holy  Spirit.  It  is  customary  for  all  those  who  are  present  to  hold 
tapers  not  only  during  the  reading  of  the  Gospels,  but  also  during  all 
the  residue  of  the  Office,  in  token  of  their  fervent  prayers  for  the  salvation 
of  the  sick  person. 

The  wheat  serves  as  the  emblem  of  the  embryo  of  a  new  life  — ■  of  heal- 
ing and  of  life  after  the  death  of  the  body  —  of  resurrection  (John  xii.  24; 
1  Cor.  xv.  36-38).  The  oil  is  the  visible  token  of  the  grace  of  healing 
(Mark  xvi.  18).  The  wine  is  used  as  a  symbol  of  the  blood  of  Christ  shed 
upon  the  cross  for  the  salvation  of  men.  The  oil  must  be  pure  olive  oil, 
without  any  admixture. 

(3)  The  oil  symbolizes  God's  mercy;  the  wine,  the  blood  which  flowed 
from  the  side  of  our  Lord  upon  the  cross.  The  union  of  the  oil  and  wine 
is  made  after  the  pattern  of  the  remedy  which  was  used  by  the  Good 
Samaritan.

(4)  The  Great  Martyr,  Demetrius  (f  at  Thessalonica,  a.d.  306),  whose 
bones  still  exude  chrism,  and  are  famous  throughout  the  Orient  as  heal- 
ing to  the  sick.  Nestor  was  a  young  Christian  of  Thessalonica  who  visited 
St.  Demetrius  in  prison  (where  the  latter  was  suffering  for  the  faith)  to 
receive  his  blessing  before  engaging  in  conflict  with  the  Emperor's 
favourite  gladiator.  Demetrius  predicted  that  Nestor  would  conquer,  but 
would  suffer  martyrdom  in  consequence;  and  so  it  came  to  pass. 

(5)  St.  Panteleimon,  of  Nicomedia,  was  a  Christian  physician,  who 
suffered  martyrdom  for  the  faith  A.  n.  296.  He  performed  many  miracu- 
lous cures  during  his  lifetime,  and  was  beheaded,  after  many  vain  efforts 
to  kill  him  by  various  torturing  assaults,  in  which  God  protected  him  from 
harm. 

(6)  "  Unmercenaries "  is  the  title  applied  to  disinterested  benefactors, 
who  alleviated  the  pangs  both  of  the  soul  and  body;  more  especially  to 
physicians  of  the  early  Church. 

(7)  In  this  act  the  Church  imitates  the  Prophet  Elisha,  who  sent  his 
staff  to  the  Shunammite  woman  (2  Kings  iv.  29).  As  the  Gospels  contain 
the  accounts  of  many  miracles  wrought  by  Jesus  Christ,  they  are  laid  upon 
the  sufferer's  head,  with  the  printed  pages  down,  in  the  hope  that  he  will 
receive  like  physical  and  spiritual  healing;  and  in  order  to  strengthen  the 
faith  in  the  written  word  of  our  Lord  in  the  minds  of  those  present. 
Christ,  in  performing  his  miracles  of  healing,  laid  his  almighty  hand  upon 

'the  sick.     Therefore  his  priests,  in  this  Office,  lay  their  hands  upon  (or 
hold)  the  Gospels,  in  token  of  reconciliation.

THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (LAYMEN). 

(1)  When  an  Orthodox  layman  dies  his  body  is  washed,  after  the  custom 
of  Apostolic  times  (Acts  ix.  37),  out  of  irespect  to  the  dead  and  a  desire 
that  he  shall  present  himself  clean  before  the  presence  of  God,  in  the 
resurrection.  Then  the  body  is  clothed  in  new  garments,  which  symbol- 
ize our  new  garment  of  incorruption  (1  Cor.  xv.  53).  The  garments  thus 
used  correspond  to  the  calling  or  rank  of  the  departed.  They  denote  that 
in  the  resurrection  every  man  must  render  an  accounting  to  God  of  the 
manner  in  which  he  has  fulfilled  his  duty  in  that  state  of  life  to  which  he 
was  called.  Thus  a  monk  is  dressed  in  monastic  garb,  and  wrapped  in  his 
mantle,  which  is  cut  a  little,  in  order  that  it  may  be  laid  about  him  in  the 
form  of  a  cross;  and  his  face  is  covered,  to  denote  that  in  the  earthly  life 
he  was  estranged  from  the  things  of  this  world. 

The  Psalter  is  read  over  the  body  of  an  Orthodox  believer  until  the  time 
is  come  to  bury  him.  This  reading  comforts  those  who  are  mourning  the 
departed,  and  inclines  them  to  prayer.  Inasmuch  as  the  Psalter  is  de- 
signed chiefly  to  represent  prayers  for  him  who  has  fallen  asleep  in  the 


6io  APPENDIX  В 

Lord,  it  is  interrupted  by  a  commemoration  of  the  dead,  with  special 
prayerful  petitions  to  God  wherein  the  dead  person  is  mentioned  by  name. 
It  is  customary  to  repeat  this  after  each  division  of  the  Psalter,  as  indi- 
cated by  the  Doxology. 

Upon  the  brow  of  the  dead  is  placed  the  chaplet,  a  strip  of  material  upon 
which  are  depicted  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  his  holy  Mother,  and  St.  John 
the  Baptist;  together  with  the  Thrice-Holy  (O  Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty, 
Holy  Immortal,  have  mercy  upon  us).  The  dead  Christian  is  thus 
adorned  with  the  wreath  like  an  athlete  who,  with  honour,  has  left  the  field 
of  contest;  or  like  a  warrior  who  has  won  a  victory.  The  figures  printed 
thereon  signify  that  he  who  has  run  his  earthly  career  hopes  to  receive  the 
crown  for  his  deeds  solely  through  the  mercy  of  the  Triune  God  and  the 
mediation  of  the  Mother  of  our  Lord  and  of  his  Forerunner. 

In  the  hand  of  the  dead  is  placed  a  holy  picture  (ikona)  of  the  Saviour, 
in  token  that  he  has  believed  in  Christ  and  has  surrendered  his  soul  to 
him;  that  in  life  he  beheld  the  Lord  by  anticipation,  and  now  is  gone  to  see 
him  face  to  face  in  blessedness,  with  the  Saints.  The  body  of  the  dead  is 
covered  with  a  holy  pall,  in  token  that,  as  one  who  has  been  a  believer  and 
has  been  sanctified  by  the  Sacraments,  he  is  under  the  protection  of 
Christ. 

At  funerals  four  standard  candlesticks  are  placed  at  the  four  sides  of  the 
coffin,  forming  a  cross.  Those  present,  both  at  funerals  and  at  Requiem 
Services  (Panikhidi),  hold  tapers,  thereby  typifying  the  light  divine 
wherewith  the  Christian  is  enlightened  at  baptism,  and  the  fervour  of  his 
prayers.  The  taper  also  serves  as  an  image  of  the  world  to  come,  of  the 
light  which  knows  no  setting. 

(2)  This,  the  song  of  the  Archangels  in  honour  of  the  Holy  Trinity,  is 
sung  because  the  dead  person  is  now  being  accompanied  into  the  realm  of 
the  Angels,  who  sing  continually  the  Thrice-Holy  hymn. 

(3)  That  is  to  say,  if  the  Sacrament  of  Holy  Unction  has  been  per- 
formed upon  the  deceased  during  his  lifetime,  the  oil  and  wine  which  re- 
mained therefrom  are  poured  over  his  dead  body.  This  anointment  is 
Christ's  token,  and  a  seal  of  confirmation  that  they  who  die  in  Christ  have 
wrought  for  Christ,  in  the  sanctification  of  their  bodies,  and  have  lived 
uprightly  in  this  earthly  life. 

(4)  The  ashes  typify  the  same  thing  as  the  unconsumed  oil  —  the  life 
which  is  extinguished  on  earth,  yet  acceptable  unto  God;  like  the  sweet 
spices  of  the  censer. 

(5)  If  anyone  departs  this  life  on  holy  Easter  Day,  or  on  any  day  of 
the  Bright  Week  which  intervenes  between  that  day  and  the  Sunday  of 
All  Saints  following,  less  than  the  customary  funeral  songs  are  sung,  be- 
cause of  the  majesty  and  honour  due  to  the  joyful  Feast  of  the  Resur- 
rection; for  it  is  a  festival  of  joy  and  gladness,  not  of  mourning.  And 
since  all  who  have  died  in  the  hope  of  resurrection  and  of  life  eternal 


APPENDIX  В  би 

through  Christ  are,  by  Christ's  resurrection,  translated  from  the  sorrowful 
things  of  this  world  to  things  glad  and  joyful,  the  Church  proclaims  this 
by  songs  of  resurrection  over  the  dead.  By  this  diminution  of  the  songs, 
litanies  and  prayers  ordinarily  appropriate  to  those  who  have  fallen  asleep, 
we  are  assured  that  he  who  dies  in  penitence,  even  if  he  have  not  yet  given 
satisfaction  for  his  sins,  has  pardon  for  them,  through  the  prayers  of  the 
Church,  and  is  freed  from  their  bonds. 

XI. 

THE  BURIAL  OF  THE  DEAD  (PRIESTS). 

(i)  At  the  burial  of  Prelates,  Hiero-monks,  Archimandrites  and  Priests, 
when  the  body  is  borne  from  the  house  to  the  church,  during  the  reading 
of  the  Prayer  of  Absolution,  and  on  the  way  to  the  grave,  the  church 
bells  are  rung,  as  they  are  when  the  holy  cross  is  brought  forth  from  the 
Sanctuary,  on  September  14,  (27),  August  1  (14),  in  Mid-Lent,  on  Good 
Friday,  and  on  Holy  Saturday.  That  is  to  say,  each  bell  is  struck  once, 
and  the  order  is  repeated  thrice,  or  oftener;  after  which  all  the  bells  are 
struck  together,  once. 

At  the  burial  of  a  Bishop  the  body  is  carried  round  the  church  on  its  way 
to  the  grave,  and  a  brief  service  is  celebrated  at  each  side  of  the  church. 

Deacons  are  buried  like  laymen;  because  in  the  Order  for  the  Burial  of 
Priests  the  sacerdotal  rank  of  the  latter  is  specifically  mentioned.  A  cen- 
ser is  placed  in  the  hand  of  the  dead  Deacon. 

(2)  A  dead  Bishop,  after  he  has  been  rubbed  with  oil  by  means  of  a 
sponge,  is  arrayed  in  all  his  sacerdotal  vestments  while  "Thy  soul  shall 
delight  itself  in  the  Lord"  is  being  sung;  and  the  censers,  sacramental 
fans,  together  with  the  double  and  triple  branched  candlesticks  (dikiri, 
trikiri)  are  used.  When  the  vesting  is  completed  he  is  seated  in  an  arm- 
chair, and  the  Proto-Deacon  proclaims:  "Send  forth  thy  light";  after 
which  the  body  is  laid  upon  a  table,  and  the  face  is  covered  with  a  sacra- 
mental veil.  The  veil  denotes  that  the  dead  was  a  minister  of  the  Sacra- 
ments of  God,  more  especially  of  the  Holy  Mysteries  of  the  Body  and 
Blood  of  Christ,  and  it  is  buried  with  him.  If  he  has  at  any  time  received 
the  Sacrament  of  Holy  Unction,  the  oil  remaining  therefrom  is  used  to 
anoint  his  body  for  burial,  as  is  the  case  also  with  Priests. 

(3)  In  token  that  he  proclaimed  unto  men  the  teachings  of  the  Gospels, 
a  cross  is  generally  placed  in  the  hands  of  a  dead  Bishop  or  Priest;  be- 
cause it  is  the  emblem  of  salvation,  both  of  the  living  and  the  dead.  The 
book  of  the  Holy  Gospels  is  buried  with  him,  and  the  cross  also.  Over 
the  remains  of  a  dead  Bishop  or  Priest  the  Gospels  are  read  instead  of 
the  Psalter,  "in  order  to  propitiate  God,"  says  Simeon  of  Thessalonica. 
"For  what  other  offering  can  be  made  unto  God,  to  propitiate  him  on 
behalf  of  him  that  lieth  there,  if  not  this,  to  wit,  the  proclamation  of  the 


6i2  APPENDIX  В 

Incarnation  of  God,  of  his  teachings,  his  Sacraments,  and  the  gift  of  the 
remission  of  sins,  his  redeeming  Passion  for  us,  his  life-creating  death  and 
resurrection?" 

XII. 

THE  REQUIEM  OFFICE  FOR  THE  DEAD  (PANIKHIDI). 

(i)  The  origin  of  the  Service  of  the  Dead  (Panikhidi)  is  as  follows:  St. 
Macarius  of  Alexandria  once  inquired  from  the  Angels  who  accompanied 
him  an  explanation  of  the  Church's  custom  to  celebrate  the  third,  ninth, 
and  fortieth  days  after  a  death  by  religious  services.  And  the  Angel  told 
him:  "When,  on  the  third  day,  the  body  is  brought  to  the  Temple,  the 
Soul  of  the  dead  man  receiveth  from  his  Guardian  Angel  relief  from  the 
grief  which  he  feeleth  at  parting  from  his  body  This  he  receiveth  be- 
cause of  the  oblation  and  praise  which  are  offered  for  him  in  God's  Church, 
whence  there  ariseth  in  him  a  blessed  hope.  For  during  the  space  of  two 
days  the  Soul  is  permitted  to  wander  at  will  over  the  earth,  with  the 
Angels  which  accompany  it.  Therefore  the  Soul,  since  it  loveth  its  body, 
sometimes  hovereth  around  the  house  in  which  it  parted  from  the  body; 
sometimes  around  the  coffin  wherein  its  body  hath  been  placed :  and  thus 
it  passeth  those  days  like  a  bird  which  seeketh  for  itself  a  nesting-place. 
But  the  beneficent  Soul  wandereth  through  those  places  where  it  was  wont 
to  perform  deeds  of  righteousness. 

"On  the  third  day  He  who  rose  again  from  the  dead  commandeth  that 
every  Soul,  in  imitation  of  his  own  Resurrection,  shall  be  brought  to 
heaven,  that  it  may  do  reverence  to  the  God  of  all.  Wherefore  the 
Church  hath  the  blessed  custom  cf  celebrating  oblation  and  prayers  on 
the  third  day  for  the  Soul. 

"After  the  Soul  hath  done  reverence  to  God,  He  ordereth  that  it  shall 
be  shown  the  varied  and  fair  abodes  of  the  Saints  and  the  beauty  of  Para- 
dise. All  these  things  the  Soul  vieweth  during  six  days,  marvelling  and 
glorifying  God,  the  Creator  of  all.  And  when  the  Soul  hath  beheld  all 
these  things,  it  is  changed,  and  forgetteth  all  the  sorrow  which  it  felt  in 
the  body.  But  if  it  be  guilty  of  sins,  then,  at  the  sight  of  the  delights  of 
the  Saints,  it  beginneth  to  wail,  and  to  reproach  itself,  saying:  'Woe  is 
me !  How  vainly  did  I  pass  my  time  in  the  world !  Engrossed  in  the 
satisfaction  of  my  desires,  I  passed  the  greater  part  of  my  life  in  heedless- 
ness, and  obeyed  not  God  as  I  ought,  that  I,  also,  might  be  vouchsafed 
these  graces  and  glories.  Woe  is  me,  poor  wretch!'  After  having  thus 
viewed  all  the  joys  of  the  Just  for  the  space  of  six  days,  the  Angels  lead 
the  Soul  again  to  do  reverence  to  God.  Therefore  the  Church  doth  well, 
in  that  she  celebrateth  service  and  oblation  for  the  Soul  on  the  ninth  day. 

"After  its  second  reverence  to  God,  the  Master  of  all  commandeth  that 
the  Soul  be  conducted  to  Hell,  and  there  shown  the  places  of  torment,  the 
different  divisions  of  Hell;  and  the  divers  torments  of  the  ungodly,  which 


APPENDIX  В  6i3 

cause  the  souls  of  sinners  that  find  themselves  therein  to  groan  continually, 
and  to  gnash  their  teeth.  Through  these  various  places  of  torment  the 
Soul  is  borne  during  thirty  days,  trembling  lest  it  also  be  condemned  to 
imprisonment  therein. 

"On  the  fortieth  day  the  Soul  is  again  taken  to  do  reverence  to  God: 
and  then  the  Judge  determineth  the  fitting  place  of  its  incarceration, 
according  to  its  deeds.  Thus  the  Church  doth  rightly  in  making  mention, 
upon  the  fortieth  day,  of  the  baptized  dead." 

It  is  also  customary  to  have  the  Requiem  Office  celebrated  on  the 
anniversaries  of  the  birth-day,  name-day,  and  death-day  of  the  departed. 

(2)  It  is  customary,  at  the  Requiem  Office  (Panikhidi) ,  to  place  upon 
a  small  table  in  the  church  a  dish  of  kutiyd  or  koliva:  that  is,  boiled  wheat, 
mixed  with  honey,  to  which  raisins  are  sometimes  added.  The  koliva 
serves  to  remind  us  of  the  resurrection  of  the  dead.  As  grain,  in  order  that 
it  may  form  ears  and  give  fruit,  must  be  buried  in  the  earth,  and  moulder 
there;  so,  also,  the  body  of  the  dead  must  be  committed  to  the  earth,  in 
order  that  it  may  rise  to  life  eternal.  The  honey  typifies  the  sweetness 
of  bliss  of  the  future  life.  In  the  grain  is  set  upright  a  lighted  taper,  which 
symbolizes  the  light  wherewith  the  Christian  is  illumined  in  baptism;  and 
also  the  light  of  the  world  to  come,  which  knows  no  setting. 

(3)  Thereby  offering  unto  God,  as  it  were,  a  sacrifice  of  propitiation  for 
the  dead  person,  and  in  honour  of  the  Sovereign  Lord  over  life  and  death. 

XIII. 
THE  CONSECRATION  OF  A  CHURCH. 

(1)  The  Canon  of  the  Holy  Orthodox-Catholic  Apostolic  Church  of  the 
East  orders  that  the  Consecration  of  a  Church  must  be  performed  by  a 
Bishop.  If,  however,  this  be  not  possible,  the  Bishop  sends  a  corporal 
iantimins)  which  has  been  consecrated  to  the  Church  that  is  to  be  conse- 
crated, and  delegates  his  authority  of  consecration  to  an  Archimandrite, 
an  Abbot,  an  Archpriest,  or  a  Priest.  In  that  case  a  briefer  Office  is  used 
than  the  one  here  given.  In  substance,  the  two  Offices  are  identical;  but 
the  most  important  part  of  the  Office  as  performed  by  a  Bishop,  namely, 
the  consecration  of  the  corporal,  is  of  necessity  omitted.  Relics  are 
placed  in  the  Altar  only  in  case  a  Bishop  consecrates  the  church.  If  the 
Altar  is  of  stone,  all  the  portions  of  the  service  prescribed  for  a  wooden 
Altar  are  omitted. 

(2)  This  garment  (Exodus  xxviii.  4)  is  white  in  colour,  and  is  trebly 
girt:  about  the  neck  of  the  officiating  ecclesiastic,  in  token  of  wisdom  and 
obedience  to  God ;  about  the  body,  beneath  the  breast,  to  symbolize  the 
Word;  about  the  loins,  as  a  symbol  of  purity  and  strength.  If  a  Bishop 
celebrate,  the  apron-like  garment  should  be  of  silk;  if  a  Priest,  of  cotton 
cloth. 


6i4  APPENDIX  В 

(3)  The  Office  of  Consecration  proper  is  preceded  by  the  Blessing  of 
Water,  in  a  form  which  greatly  resembles  that  appointed  for  the  Feast 
of  the  Epiphany. 

(4)  As  the  Altar  represents  the  sepulchre  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  so 
the  mastic,  mingled  with  fragrant  spices,  represents  the  sweet-smelling 
spices  wherewith  Joseph  of  Arimathea  and  Nicodemus  anointed  the  body 
of  our  Lord  when  they  laid  him  in  the  tomb. 

As  the  Temple  is  fashioned  after  the  image  of  our  bodies,  which  are  the 
temple  of  God  (2  Cor.  vi.  16)  and  members  of  Christ  (1  Cor.  xii.  27),  that 
rite  which  is  performed  at  the  Consecration  of  a  Church  is  analogous  to 
the  rite  by  which  every  believer  is  made  a  member  of  the  Church,  and  the 
Consecration  resembles  holy  Baptism  and  holy  Chrismation.  Therefore, 
at  a  Consecration,  rose-water,  the  holy  Chrism,  white  garments  and  tapers 
are  used:  and  the  building,  like  the  font,  is  compassed  about  in  procession, 
in  the  circle  which  is  the  emblem  of  Eternity. 

(5)  The  affixing  of  the  table  to  the  Altar  with  four  nails  commemorates 
the  nailing  of  our  Lord  to  the  cross.  The  stones  thus  used  are  not  thrown 
away,  but  are  generally  laid  beneath  the  Altar. 

(6)  Moses,  by  the  Lord's  command,  anointed  the  Tabernacle  and  the 
Altar  at  the  dedication  of  the  Temple  (Exodus  xl.  9,  10),  as  the  Altar  is 
here  first  anointed,  and  the  Sanctuary  afterwards.  The  three  places 
anointed  are  those  where,  during  the  Divine  Liturgy,  the  book  of  the  Holy 
Gospels,  the  paten  and  the  chalice  are  to  stand. 

(7)  The  corporal  (antimins)  is,  as  it  were,  the  Altar  itself,  and  takes 
the  place  of  an  Altar  when,  by  reason  of  storm  or  any  other  cause,  the 
Altar  falls  into  ruin ;  or  when  it  is  necessary  to  celebrate  the  Divine  Liturgy 
in  the  absence  of  a  duly  consecrated  Altar.  It  consists  of  a  silken  cloth, 
whereon  is  depicted  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  in  the  sepulchre.  (See  page  xxvii.) 

(8)  The  double  vesting  of  the  Altar  indicates  its  double  significance: 
as  the  tomb  of  Christ  and  the  throne  of  God.  The  first  altar-cloth  repre- 
sents the  winding-sheet  wherein  the  body  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was 
wrapped  for  burial. 

(9)  The  cord  typifies  the  cord  wherewith  our  Lord  was  bound,  when  he 
was  led  before  Annas  and  Caiaphas. 

(10)  The  second  covering  of  the  Altar,  the  inditia,  of  rich  and  brilliant 
material,  typifies  the  glory  of  God's  throne. 

(11)  This,  the  iliton,  represents  the  swaddling-clothes  wherein  the 
infant  Christ  was  wrapped  at  his  birth ;  our  Lord's  winding-sheet  in  the 
tomb;  and  the  napkin  which  was  bound  about  his  head  in  the  tomb. 
(Here,  as  in  certain  other  instances,  there  are  several  explanations  of  the 
symbolism,  upon  which  the  authorities  occasionally  differ.) 

(12)  This  typifies,  as  in  holy  Baptism,  spiritual  illumination. 

(13)  This  signifies  that  the  Church  is  consecrated  forever  to  God;  be- 
cause the  circle  is  the  symbol  of  eternity. 


APPENDIX  В  6i5 

(14)  The  holy  relics  placed  in  the  Altar  or  under  the  corporal  (anti- 
mins)  bear  witness  to  the  special  presence  there  of  God.  They  remind  the 
Christian  that  when  he  is  in  church  he  is  in  a  place  sprinkled  with  the 
blood  of  the  Saints;  and  he  rejoices  with  holy  gladness,  recalling  the 
words  of  St.  John:  "That  ye,  also,  may  have  fellowship  with  us"  (1  John 

The  holy  relics  are  anointed  with  the  holy  Chrism  as  for  burial,  in  token 
of  the  close  bond  between  the  Martyrs  and  Christ.  The  relics  of  the 
Saints  which  remain  incorruptible  on  earth  assure  us  of  the  special  prayers 
for  us  on  the  part  of  the  Saints  thus  honoured  with  immortality  of  body 
ere  the  coming  of  the  Kingdom  of  Glory  (Rev.  vi.  9,  10).
