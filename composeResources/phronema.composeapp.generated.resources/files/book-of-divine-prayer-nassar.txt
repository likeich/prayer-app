Preface  and  Invocation 

T  RAISED  be  God  the  absolute  Being,  whose  greatness  pervades 
all  existence,  great  in  himself,  glorified  in  his  creation,  who 
made  of  religion  a  lighthouse  for  guidance,  raising  his  saints  as 
exemplars  to  those  who  would  follow  in  their  footsteps,  now  by  their 
words  of  sound  doctrine,  and  now  by  their  blameless  dieds.  l^raised 
be  he  whose  abundant  mercies  have  accepted  prayer  as  a  means  of 
worship  for  his  most  holy  glory,  as  a  blessing  to  his  servants,  as 
nourishment  for  their  souls,  as  a  fountain  of  joy  for  their  spirits,  as 
a  consolation  to  them  in  their  sorrows,  and  as  a  light  to  lighten  their 
hearts  by  day  and  by  night. 

I,  Father  Seraphim  Nassar,  son  of  George,  son  of  Elias  Nassar, 
Orthodox  in  dcctrine,  born  in  Marsine,  having  long  realized  the  dire 
need  of  my  Orthodox  Christian  brethren  in  the  lands  of  their  disper- 
sion, and  especially  of  their  offspring  for  whom  the  English  language 
has  become  the  mother  tongue,  was  moved  by  religious  zeal  and 
Christian  love  to  undertake  the  translation  into  English  of  an  un- 
abridged prayer  book,  unlike  the  compendiums  that  are  now  in  use, 
for  these  latter  do  not  include  such  prayers  and  services  as  the  Great 
Horologia,  the  Psalms,  the  Prophecies,  the  Epistles,  the  Gospels,  the 
Oktoechos,  the  Menaion,  the  Triodion,  the  Pentecostarion,  the  ser- 
vice of  the  Holy  Mass,  and  the  Typicon,  all  of  which  are  necessary 
for  every  Orthodox  worshipper,  especially  chanters,  lectors,  and,  of 
course.  Priests. 

After  years  of  search  and  investigation  I  was  successful,  by  God's 
help,  in  finding  a  capable  person  to  fulfill  my  long  cherished  desire 
to  bring  this  project  to  completion.  This  solemn  undertaking  was 
begun  and  finished  in  the  town  of  Spring  Valley,  Illinois,  in  the 
United  States  of  America,  with  the  efforts  and  assistance  of  a  group 
of  God-fearing  and  devoted  daughters  of  religion,  who  both  in 
virtues  and  number  represent  the  most  essential  of  Christian  graces 
— faith,  hope,  and  charity.  Thus  I  was  enabled  to  complete  this 
book  according  to  the  pattern  I  had  laid  down,  so  that  it  fulfills  all 
the  indispensable  requirements  of  a  full  service  book  for  use  in  Orth- 
odox Churches, 

To  this  volume  I  have  added  appendices  explaining  the  true  nature 
of  the  Church  of  Christ,  founded  by  him,  the  attributes  by  which  it 
is  distinguished,  its  infallibility,  the  reason  for  its  order  of  worship, 
with  an  exposition  thereof.  To  this  has  been  added  the  division  of 
time,  the  number  of  prayers  and  notes  on  their  authors,  and  the  times 
of   their   inclusion    in    the    Church    services,   especially    those    of   the 


service^  of  the  Divine  Mass.  For  the  convenience  of  the  reader  I 
have  followed  this  appendix  with  a  glossary  of  words  and  phrases 
which  I  left  in  the  original  Greek,  with  a  table  of  contents  and  index. 
For  further  usefulness  I  added  tables  for  the  determination  of  Easter, 
after  the  Eastern  Calendar,  and  the  Western  and  Mosaic  Passovers; 
the  Epistle  and  Gospel  selections.  Tones,  and  the  Eothina  to  be  used 
each  Sunday  for  a  period  of  twenty  years,  with  blank  pages  for  the 
registration    of   marriages,   births,   baptisms,   and  deaths. 

I  have  left  the  full  exposition  of  the  Divine  Mass  and  other  mat- 
ters to  the  longer  standard  books  dealing  with  these  subjects.  I  have 
contented  myself  with  the  quotations  and  references  which  the  reader 
will  find  in  this  book,  taken  from  the  writings  of  the  Fathers  and 
commentators,  which,  as  I  believe,  are  sufficient  for  the  purpose  of 
worship  and  the  topics  of  the  services. 

Finally,  I  trust  that  this  work  of  mine  may  receive  the  commen- 
dation and  call  forth  the  satisfaction  of  my  superiors  and  the  rest 
of  my  reverend  brethren  the  Priests.  I  pray  that  they  meet  my  weak- 
ness with  their  kindness;  that  they  correct  my  errors  with  their 
gentle  reprovals,  pointing  out  my  mistakes;  and  that  they  cover  my 
shortcomings  with  their  gracious  indulgence;  and  that  they  encourage 
me  with  their  prayers. 

Receive  thou,  most  merciful  One,  by  thy  great  compassion  and 
all-pervading  bounty,  the  past  and  future  efforts  of  thy  handmaidens, 
the  sisters  of  the  Sisterhood  of  the  Propagation  of  Divine  Services 
and  Religious  Teachings  in  the  United  States — Mary,  Elizabeth,  and 
Sadie  Abraham,  referred  to  above  —  for  the  fulfillment  of  thy  will, 
the  strengthening  of  thy  Church,  and  the  glorification  of  thy  Name. 
Sufficient  unto  me  is  thy  mercy  and  the  benefit  accruing  to  the  chil- 
dren of  my  Orthodox  Church  generally. 

(Reverend)  Seraphim  Nassar 

President  of  the  Sisterhood. 

The  conclusion  of  the  translation,  comparison,  correction,  and  revi- 
sion of  this  work  took  place  in  my  residence,  322  East  Iowa  Street, 
in  the  town  of  Spring  Valley,  Illinois,  at  the  opening  of  the  year  1938. 


Petition 


Submitted  by  Father  Seraphim  Nassar  to  his  Grace,  Archbishop 

Antony  Bashir,  Seeking  Permission  for  the  Publication 

of  this  Book. 


'^' 


O  the  lordship  of  my  venerable  lord  and  master,  the  most  wise, 
the  most  noble,  and  the  most  learned  Antony  Bashir,  Arch- 
bishop of  New  York  and  all  North  America,  supreme  in  elo- 
quence of  mouth  and  pen.  May  the  radiance  of  your  years,  like  a 
brilliant  lu?ninary  long  shine  for  the  glory  of  the  holy  Church  of 
Christ. 

Having  kissed  your  holy  hands  and  sought  the  beneficence  of  your 
prayers  and  of  your  apostolic  blessings,  allow  me  to  say  that  the  best 
act  in  this  created  world  is  the  propagation  of  the  worship  of  God 
by  which  one  proclaims  the  favour,  goodness,  and  beneficence  of  the 
Creator  toward  the  creature. 

Prayer  is  the  most  direct  means  whereby  man  can  attain  this  sacred 
end,  since  it  corjiprises  petition,  praise,  and  thanksgiving  for  all  the 
favours  which  we  have  received  through  faith  in  the  Son  of  God, 
our  only  Saviour  and  Mediator. 

Since  most  of  the  children  of  our  Orthodox  Church  in  these  Ameri- 
can countries  are  occupied  with  their  worldly  affairs,  deserting  their 
Church,  and  turning  away  from  the  worship  of  their  Creator,  on 
the  pretext  that  they  are  ignorant  of  the  language  of  their  parents* 
Church,  religious  zeal  and  Christian  love  have  moved  your  son  the 
Priest,  Seraphim  Nassar,  most  unworthy  sinner  and  captive  to 
iniquity,  to  translate  the  services  of  our  Orthodox  Church  into  the 
English  language,  for  their  enlightenment,  and  to  arouse  them  from 
the  slumber  of  their  inadvertence,  and  to  lead  them  to  worship  their 
Creator. 

I  have  called  this  book  of  rnine  The  Divine  Services  of  the  Cathoh'c 
Orthodox  Church  of  Christ  and  in  it  I  have  included  all  that  the 
Christian,  clerical  or  lay,  may  need  in  his  house  or  in  the  church. 

Being  an  unworthy  Priest,  and  knowing  the  duty  of  obedience 
imposed  on  me  toward  the  respected  authority  of  the  Church,  I  come 
with  this  petition  to  supplicate  your  religious  zeal,  your  Christian 
love,  and  your  apostolic  blessing,  to  honour  me  with  permission  to 
publish  it,  in  order  to  universalize  its  benefits,  and  to  crown  my 
efforts  with  success. 

In  conclusion,  I  kiss  your  holy  hand  again,  and  ask  God  to  support 
and  establish  your  holy  presidency. 

Your  suppliant  and  son. 

Spring  Valley,  Illinois,  The  Priest,  Seraphim  Nassar.

THE  MOST  REVEREND  ANTONY  BASHIR 
ARCHBISHOP   OF   NEW    YORK   AND   ALL   NORTH    AMERICA 


Imprimatur 


0UR  beloved  son  in  the  Lord,  the  Reverend  Seraphim  Nassar, 
Pastor  of  St.  George's  Syrian  Orthodox  Church  in  Spring 
Valley,  Illinois,  is  one"  in  whom  we  have  recognized  religious 
zeal  and  true  Christian  love.  He  has  spared  no  effort  and  has  been 
tireless  in  the  cause  of  the  progress  of  the  Holy  Apostolic  Catholic 
Orthodox  Church  of  Christ,  taking  special  interest  in  the  younger 
generation  of  our  holy  Church  who  have  been  born  and  brought  up 
in  the  United  States,  regardless  of  racial  or  linguistic  origin. 

Among  other  things  in  evidence  of  this  father's  zi^al  for  religion  and 
Church,  we  may  mention  that  some  time  ago  he  wrote  a  little  novel 
based  on  the  Annunciation  to  the  Virgin  Mary,  which  he  called, 
The  Daughter  of  David,  in  which  he  sought  to  establish  the  Incarna- 
tion of  the  Word  of  God,  and  to  prove  that  Christ  is  both  God  and 
Man.  This  novel  was  translated  into  English  and  favourably  re- 
ceived b\  the  various  Orthodox  communities  and  h\  the  American 
people  generally. 

At  present,  already  translated  and  ready  for  publication  when  the 
opportunity  offers,  he  has  the  following  works: 

1.  Rays  of  Light  on  the  Sacraments.  This  is  an  exposition  of  the 
Seven  Sacraments  of  the  Church. 

2.  Outh'ne  of  Sacred  History.  For  the  benefit  of  school  children. 

3.  Outh'ne  of  Church  History. 

4.  A  Compendium  of  the  Exposition  of  the  Divine  Mass. 

5.  A  more  extended  exposition  of  the  Divine  Mass. 

6.  Exposition  of  the  Creed,  the  Canon  of  Faith. 

7.  An  Essay  on  the  Sources  of  the  Creed  or  Canon  of  Faith. 

8.  Exposition  of  the  Lord's  Prayer. 

9.  Exposition  of  the  Church's  Requirements  for  the  Child  from 
the  Time  He  is  Born  until  His  Baptism. 

10.  The  first  part  of  his  book.  Proof  of  Morality  and  the  Truth 
of  the  Faith.  This  comprises  some  of  his  sermons  and  will  be  helpful 
to  every  Christian,  particularly  those  of  the  younger  generation  among 
whom  very  few  have  a  true  understanding  of  Orthodoxy. 

Finally,  he  has  finished  his  eleventh  work.  The  Book  of  Divine 
Services  of  the  Catholic  Orthodox  Church  of  Christ,  the  manuscript 
(ij  which  is  now  in  our  hands,  and  which  we  have  perused.    Me  have 

ix 


found  it  inclusive  of  all  the  services,  rites,  and  prayers.  It  comprises 
in  its  pages,  which  exceed  one  thousand,  the  Great  Horology,  the 
Psalms,  Prophecies,  Epistles,  Gospels,  the  Oktoechos,  the  Menaion, 
the  Triodion,  the  Pentecostarion,  as  well  as  the  service  of  the 
Divine  Mass,  and  the  Typicon.  At  the  end  of  the  book  is  an  Ap- 
pendix in  which  the  reverend  father  explains  the  true  meaning  of 
the  Church  of  Christ,  established  by  God,  its  attributes,  infallibility, 
purpose  in  ordaining  the  holy  services,  with  an  exposition  of  all  that 
pertains  thereto,  and  an  explanation  of  the  division  of  time  in  accord- 
ance with  the  number  of  services,  and  the  times  of  their  introduction 
into  the  Church,  especially  as  regards  the  Divine  Mass.  The  Appendix 
also  contains  an  explanation  of  the  Mass  and  of  the  words  and  phrases 
which  have  been  left  in  the  book  in  their  original  Greek  forms.  For 
further  convenience  the  Appendix  is  followed  by  an  Easter  Table  for 
the  determinations  of  the  Jewish,  or  Mosaic  Passover,  the  Eastern 
Orthodox  Passover,,  and  the  Latin  Passover.  There  is  a  section  for 
the  Epistles,  another  for  the  Gospels,  a  chapter  on  the  Tones,  and 
the  Eothina  for  every  Sunday  of  the  year  for  a  period  of  twenty  years. 
Having  examined  this  book,  unique  in  the  English  tongue,  and 
having  realized  its  benefit,  and  the  growing  urgency  among  our 
Orthodox  people  for  it,  especially  the  singers,  readers,  and  venerable 
Priests,  we  have  given  our  permission  for  its  publication,  prompted 
by  our  desire  to  see  it  widely  distributed  among  our  Church  people, 
in  order  to  propagate  the  spirit  of  piety  and  to  confirm  true  religion 
through  prayer  and  true  worship. 

Antony  Bashir, 
Archbishop  of  New  York  and  all  North  America.

METROPOLITE  GERMANUS  SHIHADAH 


Dedication 


^^: 


the  spirit  of  my  father  in  the  Priesthood,  the  thrice  blessed 
memory,  Metropolitan  Ger?nanus  Shihadah;  to  that  spirit 
without  whose  bountiful  affluence  towards  me,  manifested  by 
my  being  the  first  to  set  the  service  of  the  Divine  Mass  into  the 
English  language,  this  door  would  not  have  been  opened  before  me, 
nor  would  I  have  beheld  that  light  which  guided  me  in  this  way 
that  I  have  taken,  nor  come  to  the  end  which  I  have  now  reached 
through  the  help  of  God. 

For  behold,  while  thou.  O  pure  spirit,  hast  departed  this  existence, 
thou  art  still  living  in  thine  essence,  through  holy  deeds,  and  through 
what  thou  hast  left  of  beautiful  memory,  for  the  glory  of  God  and 
the  good  of  the  Church. 

Thy  faithful  son, 

(Reverend)  Seraphim  Nassar.

PRAYER  AFTER  RISING  UP  FROM  SLEEP 

I 

ilWhen  you  arise  from  sleeps  stand  away  from  your  bed,  in  rever- 
ence and  fear  of  God;  make  the  sign  of  the  cross;  and  say: 

TN  the  Name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of 

the  Holy  Spirit,  one  God.     Amen. 

Glory  to  thee  our  God,  glory  to  thee. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  truth, 
who  art  in  all  places  and  fillest  all  things;  Treasury  of 
good  things,  and  Giver  of  life;  come,  take  up  thine 
abode  in  us,  cleanse  us  from  every  stain,  and  save,  good 
One,  our  souls. 

Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have 
mercy  upon  us  (three  times). 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

O  all-holy  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  us;  O  Lord, 
forgive  us  our  sins;  O  Master,  pardon  our  transgres- 
sions. O  holy  One,  visit  and  heal  our  infirmities  for 
thy  Name's  sake.  Lord,  have  mercy;  Lord,  have 
mercy;  Lord,  have  mercy. 

Glory  to  the  Father  (complete). 

r\\]K  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  hallowed  be  thy 
Name;  thy  kingdom  come;  thy  will  be  done,  on 
earth  as  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this  day  our  daily 
bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses,  as  we  forgive 
those  who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into 
temptation,  but  deliver  us  from  the  evil  one. 

For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  and  the  power,  and  the 
glory,  O  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit,  now  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 


24  Prayer  After  Rising  Up  From  Sleep 

C  'Till' II   the   folloiviiu/    Tritntarian    Troparia. 

AT  our  arising  from  sleep,  we  bow  down  before 
thee,  O  God,  and  cry  out  to  thee,  O  mighty  One, 
with  the  song  of  the  angels,  saying,  Holy,  Holy,  Holy 
art  thou,  O  God.  For  the  sake  of  the  Theotokos,  have 
mercy  upon  us. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit. 

Thou  hast  gotten  me  up  from  my  bed,  and  from  my 
sleep.  Lighten,  O  Lord,  my  mind  and  my  heart;  open 
my  mouth  to  praise  thee,  O  Holy  Trinity,  saying,  Holv, 
Holy,  Holy  art  thou,  O  God.  For  the  sake  of  the 
Theotokos,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Suddenly  the  Judge  shall  come,  and  the  deeds  of 
each  one  of  us  shall  be  laid  bare.  Therefore,  it  b^- 
hoveth  us  to  cry  with  fear  at  midnight,  saying.  Holy, 
Holy,  Holy  art  thou,  O  God.  For  the  sake  of  the 
Theotokos,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

CLord,  have  mercy  {twelve  times)  ;  and  the  following  prayer. 

A  T  my  rising  from  sleep  I  thank  thee,  O  Holy 
Trinity,  because  of  the  abundance  of  thy  goodness 
and  long-suffering  thou  wast  not  wroth  with  me  a  sin 
ner;  nor  let  me  perish  by  mine  iniquities,  but  hast  been 
gracious  to  me,  sympathized  with  me  after  thine  own 
manner,  and  raised  me  up,  when  I  had  fallen  into 
despair,  to  hasten  to  praise  thy  power.  Now  lighten 
thou  the  eyes  of  my  mind  and  open  my  mouth  to  medi- 
tate on  thy  words,  to  understand  thy  commandments, 
to  do  thy  will,  to  sing  to  thee  with  confession  of  the 
heart,  and  to  praise  thine  all-holy  Name,  O  Father,  Son, 
and  Holy  Spirit,  now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen.

prepared  nic,  an  unworthy  sinner,  to  rise  from  sleep 
and  to  gain  entrance  into  thy  holy  house.  Accept  thou, 
Lord,  the  voice  of  my  beseeching,  as  from  thy  holy 
intelligential  powers.  Be  pleased  that  my  song,  issu- 
ing from  impure  lips,  be  offered  to  thee  with  a  pure 
heart  and  wnth  the  spirit  of  humility,  that  I  too  may 
become  a  companion  of  the  wise  virgins,  with  the 
bright  lamp  of  my  soul,  that  I  may  glorify  thee,  Word 
of  God,  glorified  in  the  Father  and  in  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Amen.

C\  LORD,  save  thy  people  and  bless  thine  inherit-

upon  the  Cross,  bestow  thy  bounties  upon  the  new  peo- 
ple which  is  called  by  thy  Name,  O  Christ  our  God; 
make  glad  with  thy  might  our  believing  kings,  granting 
them  victory  over  their  adversaries.  May  thine  aid 
be  a  panoply  of  peace,  a  trophy  invincible. 

Now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.     Amen. 

O  dread  Champion,  who  cannot  be  put  to  confusion, 
despise  not  our  petitions.  O  good  one,  all-lauded 
Theotokos,  establish  thou  the  way  of  those  who  hold 
the  Orthodox  Faith;  save  those  whom  thou  hast  called 
to  rule  over  us;  bestow  upon  them  victory  from  heaven; 
for  thou  didst  give  birth  unto  God,  O  only  blessed  one. 

Lord,  have  mercy  (twelve  times).

^Then   the  following  Psalms. 

Psalm  3 

TI7HY,  O  Lord,  are  they  multiplied  that  afflict  me? 
^^    Many  are  they  who  rise  up   against  me. 

Many  say  to  my  soul:  There  is  no  salvation  for 
him  in  his  God. 

But  thou,  O  Lord,  art  my  protector,  my  glory, 
and  the  lifter  up  of  my  head. 

I  have  cried  to  the  Lord  with  my  voice:  and  he 
hath  heard  me  from  his  holy  hill. 

I  have  slept  and  have  taken  my  rest:  and  I  have 
risen  up,  because  the  Lord  hath  protected  me. 

I  will  not  fear  thousands  of  the  people,  surround- 
ing me:  arise,  O  Lord;  save  me,  O  my  God. 

For  thou  hast  struck  all  them  who  are  my  adversaries 
without  cause:  thou  hast  broken  the  teeth  of  sinners. 

Salvation  is  of  the  Lord:  and  thy  blessing  is  upon 
thy  people. 

Psalm  37 

T^  EBUKE  me  not,  O  Lord,  in  thy  indignation;  nor 
-'■^  chastise  me  in  thy  wrath. 

For  thy  arrows  are  fastened  in  me:  and  thy  hand 
hath  been  strong  upon  me. 

There  is  no  health  in  my  flesh,  because  of  thy  wrath: 
there  is  no  peace  for  my  bones,  because  of  my  sins. 

For  my  iniquities  are  gone  over  my  head:  and  as  a 
heavy  burden  are  become  heavy  upon'  me. 

My  sores  are  putrified  and  corrupted,  because  of 
my  foolishness. 

I  am  become  miserable,  and  am  bowed  down  even 
to  the  end :  I  walked  sorrowful  all  the  day  long. 

For  my  loins  are  filled  with  illusions;  and  there  is 
no  health  in  my  flesh. 

I  am  afflicted  and  humbled  exceedingly:  I  roared 
with  the  groaning  of  my  heart. 

Lord,  all  my  desire  is  before  thee,  and  my  groaning 
is  not  hidden  from  thee. 


special  Matin  Prayers  27 

My  heart  is  troubled,  my  strength  hath  left  me, 
and  the  light  of  my  eyes  itself  is  not  with  me. 

My  friends  and  my  neighbours  have  drawn  near, 
and  stood  against  me. 

And  they  that  were  near  me  stood  afar  off: 

And  they  that  sought  my  soul  used  violence. 

And  they  that  sought  evils  to  me  spoke  vain  things, 
and  studied  deceits  all  the  day  long. 

But  I,  as  a  deaf  man,  heard  not:  and  as  a  dumb  man 
not  opening  his  mouth. 

And  I  became  as  a  man  that  heareth  not:  and  that 
hath  no  reproofs  in  his  mouth. 

For  in  thee,  O  Lord,  have  I  hoped:  thou  wilt  hear 
me,  O  Lord  my  God. 

For  I  said :  Lest  at  any  time  my  enemies  rejoice 
over  me:  and  whilst  my  feet  are  moved,  they  speak 
great  things  against  me. 

For  I  am  ready  for  scourges:  and  my  sorrow  is  con- 
tinually before  me. 

For  I  will  declare  my  iniquity:  and  I  will  think 
for  my  sin. 

But  my  enemies  live,  and  are  stronger  than  I :  and 
they  that  hate  me  wrongfully  are  multiplied. 

They  that  render  evil  for  good,  have  detracted  me, 
because  I  followed  goodness. 

Forsake  me  not,  O  Lord  my  God:  do  not  thou 
depart  from  me. 

Attend  unto  my  help,  O  Lord,  the  God  of  my  sal- 
vation. 

Psalm  62 

r^  GOD,  my  God,  to  thee  do  I  watch  at  the  break 
of  day. 

For  thee  my  soul  hath  thirsted;  for  thee  my  flesh, 
O  how  many  ways. 

In  a  desert  land,  and  where  there  is  no  way,  and  no 
water:  so  in  the  sanctuary  have  I  come  before  thee,  to 
see  thy  power  and  thy  glory. 


28  Special  Matin  Prayers 

Vov  thy  mercy  is  better  than  lives:  thee  my  lips 
shall  praise. 

Thus  will  1  bless  thee  all  my  life  long:  and  in  thy 
name  I  will  lift  up  my  hands. 

Let  my  soul  be  filled  as  with  marrow  and  fatness: 
and  my  mouth  shall  praise  thee  with  joyful  lips. 

If  I  have  remembered  thee  upon  my  bed,  I  will 
meditate  on  thee  in  the  morning:  because  thou  hast 
been  my  helper. 

And  I  will  rejoice  under  the  covert  of  thy  wings: 
my  soul  hath  stuck  close  to  thee:  thy  right  hand  hath 
received  me. 

But  they  have  sought  my  soul  in  vain,  they  shall  go 
into  the  lower  parts  of  the  earth: 

They  shall  be  delivered  into  the  hands  of  the  sword, 
they  shall  be  the  portions  of  foxes. 

But  the  king  shall  rejoice  in  God,  all  they  shall  be 
praised  that  swear  by  him  :  because  the  mouth  is  stopped 
of  them  that  speak  wicked  things. 

Have  I  not  remembered  thee  in  my  bed,  and  thought 
upon  thee  when  I  was  waking,  because  thou  hast  been 
my  helper,  therefore  under  the  shadow  of  thy  wings 
will  I  rejoice,  and  my  soul  hangeth  upon  thee,  thy 
right  hand  hath  upholden  me. 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit,  now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.  Amen. 
Alleluia,  Alleluia,  Alleluia,  glory  to  thee,  O  God. 
Lord,  have  mercy;  Lord,  have  mercy;  Lord,  have 
mercy.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to 
the  Holy  Spirit,  now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages. 
Amen. 

Psalm  87 

/^  LORD,  the  God  of  my  salvation:  I  have  cried  in 
^^  the  day,  and  in  the  night  before  thee. 

Let  my  prayer  come  in  before  thee:  incline  thy  ear 
to  my  petition. 

For  my  soul  is  filled  with  evils:  and  my  life  hath 
drawn  nigh  to  hell.

I  am  counted  among  them  that  go  down  to  the  pit: 
I  am  become  as  a  man  without  help,  free  among  the 
dead. 

Like  the  slain  sleeping  in  the  sepulchres  whom  thou 
rememberest  no  more:  and  they  are  cast  ofjf  from  thy 
hand. 

They  have  laid  me  in  the  lower  pit:  in  the  dark 
places,  and  in  the  shadow  of  death. 

Thy  wrath  is  strong  over  me:  and  all  thy  waves 
thou  hast  brought  in  upon  me. 

Thou  hast  put  away  my  acquaintance  far  from  mc: 
they  have  set  me  an  abomination  to  themselves. 

I  was  delivered  up,  and  came  not  forth;  my  eyes 
languished  through  poverty. 

All  the  day  I  cried  to  thee,  O  Lord:  I  stretched  out 
my  hands  to  thee. 

Wilt  thou  shew  wonders  to  the  dead?  or  shall  phy- 
sicians raise  to  life,  and  give  praise  to  thee? 

Shall  any  one  in  the  sepulchre  declare  thy  mercy: 
and  thy  truth  in  destruction? 

Shall  thy  wonders  be  known  in  the  dark;  and  thy 
justice  in  the  land  of  forgetfulness? 

But  I,  O  Lord,  have  cried  to  thee:  and  in  the  morn- 
ing my  prayer  shall  prevent  thee. 

Lord,  why  castest  thou  off  my  prayer:  why  turnest 
thou  away  thy  face  from  me? 

I  am  poor,  and  in  labours  from  my  youth :  and  being 
exalted  have  been  humbled  and  troubled. 

Thy  wrath  hath  come  upon  me :  and  thy  terrors  have 
troubled  me. 

They  have  come  round  about  me  like  water  all  the 
day:  they  have  compassed  me  about  together. 

Friend  and  neighbour  thou  hast  put  far  from  me: 
and  my  acquaintance,  because  of  misery. 

O  Lord  God  of  my  salvation  I  have  cried  day  and 
night  before  thee:  O  let  my  prayer  enter  into  thy  pres- 
ence, incline  thine  ear  unto  my  calling.

T)  LESS  the  Lord,  O  my  soul :  and  let  all  that  is  within 
^    me  bless  his  holy  name. 

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul,  and  never  forget  all  he 
hath  done  for  thee. 

Who  forgiveth  all  thy  iniquities :  who  healeth  all  thy 
diseases. 

Who  redeemeth  thy  life  from  destruction:  who 
crowneth  thee  with  mercy  and  compassion. 

Who  satisfieth  thy  desire  with  good  things:  thy 
youth  shall  be  renewed  like  the  eagle's. 

The  Lord  doeth  mercies  and  judgment  for  all  that 
sufifer  wrong. 

He  hath  made  his  ways  known  to  Moses:  his  wills 
to  the  children  of  Israel. 

The  Lord  is  compassionate  and  merciful :  long-sufTer- 
ing  and  plenteous  in  mercy. 

He  will  not  always  be  angry:  nor  will  he  threaten 
for  ever. 

He  hath  not  dealt  with  us  according  to  our  sins:  nor 
rewarded  us  according  to  our  iniquities. 

For  according  to  the  height  of  the  heaven  above  the 
earth:  he  hath  strengthened  his  mercy  towards  them 
that  fear  him. 

As  far  as  the  east  is  from  the  west,  so  far  hath  he 
removed  our  iniquities  from  us. 

As  a  father  hath  compassion  on  his  children,  so  hath 
the  Lord  compassion  on  them  that  fear  him:  for  he 
knoweth  our  frame. 

He  remembereth  that  we  are  dust:  man's  days  are  as 
grass,  as  the  flower  of  the  field  so  shall  he  flourish. 

For  the  spirit  shall  pass  in  him,  and  he  shall  not  be: 
and  he  shall  know  his  place  no  more. 

But  the  mercy  of  the  Lord  is  from  eternity  and  unto 
eternity  upon  them  that  fear  him: 

And  his  justice  unto  children's  children,  to  such  as 
keep  his  covenant, 

And  are  mindful  of  his  commandments  to  do  them.

The  Lord  hath  prepared  his  throne  in  heaven:  and 
his  kingdom  shall  rule  over  all. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  angels:  you  that  are  mighty 
in  strength,  and  execute  his  word,  hearkening  to  the 
voice  of  his  orders. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  hosts:  you  ministers  of 
his  that  do  his  v^ill. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  his  works:  in  every  place  of  his 
dominion,  O  my  soul,  bless  thou  the  Lord. 

Psalm  142 

LJEAR,  O  Lord,  my  prayer:  give  ear  to  my  suppli- 
cation  in  thy  truth:  hear  me  in  thy  justice. 

And  enter  not  into  judgment  with  thy  servant:  for 
in  thy  sight  no  man  living  shall  be  justified. 

For  the  enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul:  he  hath 
brought  down  my  life  to  the  earth. 

He  hath  made  me  to  dwell  in  darkness  as  those  that 
have  been  dead  of  old:  and  my  spirit  is  in  anguish 
within  me:  my  heart  within  me  is  troubled. 

I  remembered  the  days  of  old,  I  meditated  on  all 
thy  works:  I  meditated  the  works  of  thy  hands. 

I  stretched  forth  my  hands  to  thee:  my  soul  is  as 
earth  without  water  unto  thee. 

Hear  me  speedily,.  O  Lord:  my  spirit  hath  fainted 
away. 

Turn  not  away  thy  face  from  me,  lest  I  be  like  unto 
them  that  go  down  into  the  pit. 

Cause  me  to  hear  thy  mercy  in  the  morning;  for 
in  thee  have  I  hoped. 

Make  the  way  known  to  me,  wherein  I  should  walk: 
for  I  have  lifted  up  my  soul  to  thee. 

Deliver  me  from  my  enemies,  O  Lord,  to  thee  have 
I  fled :  teach  me  to  do  thy  will,  for  thou  art  my  God. 

Thy  good  spirit  shall  lead  me  into  the  right  land: 
for  thy  name's  sake,  O  Lord,  thou  wilt  quicken  me  in 
thy  justice.  Thou  wilt  bring  my  soul  out  of  trouble: 
and  in  thy  mercy  thou  wilt  destroy  my  enemies.

PANAGIA 

nPHIS  is  a  Greek  word  which  means  all-holy;  but 
it  has  come  to  be  applied  to  a  special  piece  of  the 
bread  of  oblations  cut  in  triangular  shape,  symbolizing 
the  Holy  Trinity.  It  is  called  Panagia  because  when 
the  Priest  lifts  it  up  he  calls  for  the  aid  of  the  all-holy 
Theotokos. 

The  service  of  lifting  up  the  Panagia,  as  explained 
in  the  Big  Book  of  Prayers  (Horologion),  originated, 
according  to  church  tradition,  in  the  time  of  the  unde- 
filed  Apostles.  This  is  what  church  tradition  has  to 
say  on  the  subject: 


42  Panagia 

When  our  Lord  and  God  Jesus  Christ  was  preparing 
for  his  voluntary  Passion  and  Death,  he  began  to  con- 
verse with  his  Disciples  in  his  farewell  discourse  with 
them,  as  they  sat  at  table  for  the  Last  Supper,  at  which 
he  instituted  the  divine  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist. 
Afterwards,  when  he  rose  from  the  dead,  he  appeared 
to  his  Disciples,  and  often  blessed  their  tables  and  sat 
to  eat  with  them.  Thus  he  blessed  the  supper  of  the 
two  Disciples  who  were  going  to  Emmaus,  and  they 
recognized  him  when  he  took  bread,  blessed  it,  broke 
it,  and  gave  them  to  eat  (St.  Lk.  24:13-31).  On  the 
same  day  Jesus  appeared  to  the  eleven  Disciples  and  to 
those  who  were  gathered  in  the  Upper  Room  of  Zion, 
and  he  asked  them  for  food  to  eat.  They  gave  him  a 
piece  of  a  broiled  fish  and  a  honeycomb.  He  took  them 
and  ate  before  them,  then  took  that  which  was  left  and 
gave  them  to  eat  (St.  Lk.  24:36-43).  Likewise,  Jesus 
appeared  to  his  Disciples  at  the  Lake  of  Tiberias.  As 
they  had  worked  hard  all  that  night  and  had  not  been 
able  to  catch  any  fish,  he  commanded  them  to  cast  the 
net  to  the  right  side  of  the  ship;  and  having  cast  it  they 
caught  a  great  quantity  of  fish.^  When  they  came  to  the 
beach  they  saw  a  stone  with  fish  on  it  and  bread.  And 
Jesus  came  forward,  took  bread,  and  gave  it  to  them, 
and  he  did  likewise  with  the  fish   (St.  Jno.  21:4-13). 

The  undefiled  Apostles,  therefore,  in  memory  of  the 
fact  that  Jesus  before  his  voluntary  Death  and  after  it 
always  blessed  their  tables  and  broke  bread  and  ate 
with  them,  were  accustomed  to  leave  an  empty  space 
in  the  middle  of  the  table  where  they  placed  a  cushion. 
On  this  cushion  they  laid  a  piece  of  the  bread  they  were 
eating  for  the  Lord  Jesus,  as  though  he  were  present 
among  them.  When  they  had  finished  supper  they 
would  pray  and  give  thanks,  then  take  that  piece  of 
bread,  and  lift  it  high  as  they  said.  Glory  to  thee,  our 
God,  glory  to  thee.  Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the 
Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  Great  is  the  Name  of 
the  Holy  Trinity.    The  Lord  is  risen.    These  were  the 


Panagia  43 

words  they  used  from  Easter  to  Ascension,  and  after 
Ascension  they  would  say,  Great  is  the  Name  of  the 
Holy  Trinity.  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  help  us.  Thus 
did  each  Disciple  wherever  he  happened  to  be,  until 
they  all  came  together  at  the  falling  asleep  of  the  Lady 
Theotokos;  for  on  the  third  day  from  her  burial,  when, 
as  was  their  wont,  they  lifted  up  the  piece  of  bread 
which  is  the  Lord's,  and  were  about  to  say,  Great  is  the 
Name,  behold,  the  virgin  Theotokos,  wrapped  in  a 
brilliant  cloud  and  surrounded  by  radiant  angels,  ap- 
peared to  them  and  said,  Rejoice:  I  shall  be  with  you 
unto  the  end  of  time. 

The  Disciples  were  greatly  surprised  at  this  wonder- 
ful appearance,  and  instead  of  saying,  as  they  custom- 
arily did,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  they  shouted  spontane- 
ously, O  all-holy  Theotokos,  help  us.  Then  they  went 
to  the  tomb,  and  not  finding  her  undefiled  body  there, 
they  ascertained  her  resurrection  from  the  dead  on  the 
third  day  after  her  burial. 

This,  therefore,  according  to  tradition,  is  the  origin 
of  the  Lifting  of  the  Panagia,  which  is  still  carried  out 
in  all  the  monasteries  of  the  holy  mountain  of  Athos, 
and  most  of  the  monasteries  of  Russia,  at  the  partaking 
of  the  dinner  meal,  after  the  Holy  Mass. 

This  service  was  also  performed,  from  time  imme- 
morial, in  behalf  of  the  health  and  safety  of  travellers 
by  land  or  sea,  as  it  is  recorded  in  the  Great  Euch- 
ologia,  and  similarly  as  a  service  for  health,  safety, 
success,  or  deliverance  from  any  sickness  or  affliction. 
On  such  occasions  the  Priest  undertakes  this  service  in 
the  church,  at  the  time  of  Matin  Prayer,  following  the 
words.  With  songs  of  praise  we  do  magnify  the  Theo- 
tokos and  Mother  of  Light;  or  in  the  Divine  Mass, 
after  the  Priest  says.  And  especially  for  the  all-holy, 
etc.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  prayer,  the  Priest  delivers 
the  lifted  bread  to  those  who  offered  the  oblation.  The 
service  may  be  also  carried  out  at  home,  when  the  Priest 
is  invited  to  dinner,  at  which  time  he  performs  the 


44  Panagia 

service  of  the  Lifting  of  the  Panagia  after  dinner. 
Here,  however,  instead  of  the  Priest  saying,  O  all-holy 
Theotokos,  help  us,  he  says,  O  all-holy  Theotokos,  help 
thy  servant  (or  servants),  mentioning  the  name  or 
names  of  those  for  whose  benefit  the  service  is  per- 
formed. 

The  manner  in  which  the  service  of  the  Panagia  is 
carried  out  is  as  follows: 

After  offering  thanksgiving,  and  the  recitation  of  the 
Lord's  Prayer,  Our  father,  who  art  in  heaven,  etc., 
for  daily  bread,  they  all  get  up  from  the  table,  and  out 
of  one  loaf  of  bread  they  take  a  triangular  piece,  sym- 
bolizing the  Trinity  and  Oneness  of  the  Holy  Trinity; 
for  both  the  three  sides  and  the  three  angles  indicate 
the  Trinity  of  the  Holy  Trinity,  and  each  corner  or 
angle  indicates  its  Oneness.  Thus  whichever  way  you 
turn  the  piece  of  bread  you  find  it  with  three  angles, 
and  this  ends  in  a  sharp  point.  This  piece  of  bread, 
which  the  Fathers  received  by  an  unwritten  apostolic 
transmission,  we  offer  unto  the  one  God  in  the  Trinity, 
in  the  name  of  the  Theotokos,  through  whose  divine 
birthgiving  we  came  to  know  the  Holy  Trinity,  and  the 
one  God  in  the  Trinity. 

It  is  placed  in  a  special  receptacle,  and  after  the 
Priest  seals  it  with  the  sign  of  the  cross,  those  present 
light  a  lamp  which  they  place  in  front  of  it.  Then 
after  the  usual  saying  of  grace  and  dinner  is  over,  one 
of  the  Priests,  chosen  for  this  purpose,  having  first 
sought  permission  of  the  brethren,  lifts  the  piece  of 
bread,  crying,  Great  is  the  Name,  and  the  rest  respond, 
Of  the  Holy  Trinity.  Then  the  Priest  makes  the  sign 
of  the  cross  in  the  air  with  the  bread,  saying,  O  all- 
holy  Theotokos,  help  us.  And  all  shout  in  unison. 
Through  her  intercessions,  O  God,  have  mercy  upon 
us  and  save  us.  Then  immediately  they  sing  to  the 
Theotokos,  All  generations  bless  thee,  etc;  Rejoice,  O 
Theotokos,  Virgin  Mary,  full  of  grace,  the  Lord  be 
with  thee,  etc.;  and  It  is  meet,  etc. 


Prayers  of  the   Paraclcticc  45 

This  piece  of  bread,  therefore,  because  of  the  calling 
of  the  Name  of  the  most  Holy  Trinity  over  it,  and  the 
making  of  the  sign  of  the  cross  at  the  beginning  of  the 
service,  and  because  through  it  we  seek  the  aid  of  the 
Theotokos,  is  highly  effective,  in  that  it  delivers  us  from 
all  afflictions,  fills  us  with  blessings,  and  saves  us  at  all 
times.  And  because  of  this,  St.  Simeon  the  Thessalonian 
proposed  the  performance  of  this  service  daily  in  all 
the  churches,  after  the  Ninth  Ode  in  the  Matin  Prayer.

thy  great  deeds,  though  we  are  unworthy;  for

have  delivered  us  from  such  tribulations  and  anxieties? 
Who  would  have  kept  us  free  until  now?    We  shall  not

ginneth  the  following  Canon,  in  the  Eighth  Tone  and  with  each 
section  of  Troparia  saith: 

O  most  holy  Theotokos,  save  us.^ 

First  Ode 

^ERILY,  the  people  of  Israel  passed  over  the  wet 

as  on  dry  land,  fleeing  Egyptian  misery;  and  they 

shouted,  saying,  Let  us  praise  our  Deliverer  and  God. 

Sundry  temptations  have  encompassed  us,  O  Virgin. 
In  thee  do  we  seek  refuge  before  seeking  salvation. 
Therefore,  O  Mother  of  the  Word,  deliver  us  from  our 
difficulties  and  oppressions. 

The  shocks  of  sufifering,  O  Maiden,  trouble  us  ex- 
ceedingly, and  our  souls  are  filled  with  deep  sorrow. 
Deliver  us,  therefore,  into  the  tranquility  of  thy  Son 
and  God,  O  blameless  one. 

Since  thou  hast  given  birth,  O  Virgin  to  our  God  and 
Saviour,  we  beseech  thee  to  deliver  us  from  all  mishaps ; 
for  in  thee  do  we  seek  refuge,  and  towards  thee  do  we 
stretch  our  soul  and  mind. 

O  thou  alone,  Theotokos,  didst  give  birth  to  the  good 
and  righteous  One;  for  thou  art  righteous.  Make  us 
who  are  sick  in  soul  and  body  worthy  of  the  divine  cov- 
enant, and  of  providence  from  thee. 

Third  Ode 

Q    LORD,   Uplifter  of   the   heavenly  canopy   and 
Builder  of  thy  Church,  establish  thou  me  in  thy 
love,  O  End  of  all  desire,  and  Constancy  of  believers, 
O  thou  alone  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

0  virgin  Theotokos,  we  have  made  thee  an  interces- 
sor and  protector  of  our  lives.     Direct  us  and  lead  us

to  thy  haven,  O  thou  cause  of  all  good  things,  and  the 
constancy  of  believers,  O  thou  w^ho  art  all-praised. 

We  beseech  thee,  O  Virgin,  to  disperse  in  us  all 
inward  agitation,  and  every  tempest  of  grief;  for  thou, 
O  bride  of  God,  didst  give  birth  to  Christ,  the  Essence 
of  tranquility,  O  thou  vs^ho  alone  art  all-pure. 

O  thou  w^ho  didst  give  birth  to  the  Benefactor,  the 
Cause  of  all  good  things,  cause  to  spring  forth  for  us 
all  the  riches  of  liberality  and  beneficence;  for  thou  art 
capable  of  all  that  thou  desirest,  since  thou  didst  give 
birth  to  Christ,  mighty  in  power,  O  thou  blessed  of  God. 

We  are  visited,  O  Virgin,  with  pressing  ills  and  dis- 
tressing sufferings.  Help  us;  for  we  know,  O  blameless 
one,  that  thou  art  a  treasury  of  healing,  never-failing 
and  imperishable. 

Deliver  thy  servants  from  tribulation,  O  Theotokos; 
for  to  thee,  after  God,  we  go  for  refuge,  since  thou  art 
an  impregnable  fortress  and  an  intercessor. 

Turn  with  compassion,  O  all-praised  Theotokos,  to 
the  wretchedness  of  our  bodies,  and  heal  the  pains  of 
our  souls. 

Deacon.  Have  mercy  on  us,  O  God,  according  to  the 
multitude  of  thy  tender  mercies,  we  beseech  thee.  An- 
swer, and  have  mercy. 

Choir.   Lord,  have  mercy  {three  times). 

Deacon.  Again  we  ask  mercy,  life,  safety,  health, 
and  salvation  for  the  servant  of  God  {here  mention  the 
name  of  him  for  whom  petition  is  made),  to  visit  him, 
pardon  him,  and  forgive  him  his  sins. 

Choir,    Lord,  have  mercy  {twelve  times).

swift  intercession. 

Fourth  Ode 

T  HAVE  heard,  O  Lord,  of  the  mystery  of  thy  dis- 

pensation,  and  have  contemplated  thy  works,  there- 
fore have  I  glorified  thy  Godhead. 

Soothe  the  agitation  of  our  sufferings  and  calm  the 
tempest  of  our  sins,  O  thou  bride  of  God,  who  didst 
give  birth  to  the  ordaining  Lord. 

O  thou  who  didst  give  birth  to  the  Compassionate,  the 
Saviour  of  all  who  praise  thee,  grant  us,  we  beseech 
thee,  the  depth  of  thy  mercy. 

Having  enjoyed  thy  gifts,  O  all  immaculate  one,  we 
who  know  that  thou  art  the  Theotokos  sing  to  thee  a 
song  of  praise. 

Having  possessed  thee,  O  all-praised  one,  a  hope  and 
constancy,  a  wall  of  salvation  unshaken,  we  are  deliv- 
ered by  thee  from  trials. 

Fifth  Ode 

ILLUMINATE  us  with  thy  commands,  O  Lord,  and 

with  thy  high  arm  grant  us  thy  peace,  O  Lover  of 
mankind. 

Fill  our  hearts,  O  pure  one,  with  happiness,  granting 
us,  O  thou  who  didst  give  birth  to  the  Cause  of  happi- 
ness and  joy,  thine  incorruptible  joy. 

O  undefiled  Theotokos,  who  didst  give  birth  to  eter- 
nal Redemption  and  Safety,  surpassing  all  intelligence, 
deliver  us  from  tribulation. 

O  thou  who  art  a  bride  of  God,  who  didst  give  birth 
to  the  divine  Light  before  the  ages,  disperse  the  dark- 
ness, and  grant  us  joy,  thine  incorruptible  joy. 

O  pure  one,  heal  the  ills  of  our  souls,  preparing  us 
for  thy  visitation,  and  grant  us  health  through  thine 
intercession.

Sixth  Ode 

OEFORE  the  Lord  do  I  pour  out  mine  invocation; 
^^^  and  my  sorrows  before  him  do  I  tell;  for  my  soul 
is  filled  with  iniquities,  and  my  life  has  drawn  near  to 
hades.  With  thee,  therefore,  do  I  plead,  as  Jonah,  shout- 
ing, Raise  me  from  corruption,  O  my  God. 

Beseech,  O  Virgin,  thy  Lord  and  Son,  who  by  deliv- 
ering himself  to  death  saved  our  death-ridden  and  cor- 
rupt nature  from  death  and  corruption,  that  he  may 
deliver  me  from  the  harm  of  evil  enemies. 

Thee  do  we  know,  O  Virgin,  as  an  intercessor  for 
our  lives,  a  sound  protection,  remover  of  diverse  temp- 
tations, and  repudiator  of  the  devil's  cunning  wiles. 
We  beseech  thee  always  to  deliver  us  from  the  corrup- 
tion of  our  sufferings. 

We  have  possessed  thee,  O  Maiden,  a  wall  of  refuge, 
a  full  salvation  for  our  souls,  and  a  relief  from  our  dis- 
tresses. In  thy  light  do  we  ever  rejoice.  Therefore, 
O  Lady,  deliver  us  now  from  tribulations  and  suf- 
ferings. 

On  a  bed  of  ills  are  we  now  thrown,  and  there  is  no 
healing  for  our  bodies.  Wherefore,  O  thou  who  didst 
give  birth  to  God,  the  Saviour  of  the  world,  and  the 
Remover  of  ills,  we  beseech  thee,  O  righteous  one,  to 
lift  us  from  the  corruption  of  ills. 

Deliver  thy  servants  from  tribulations,  O  Theotokos; 
for  we  all,  after  God,  seek  refuge  in  thee,  since  thou 
art  an  impregnable  fortress  and  an  intercessor. 

O  pure  one,  who  by  a  word  didst  give  birth  to  the 
Word  inef]fably,  plead  with  him;  for  thou  hast  the  priv- 
ilege of  motherhood.

4iThen  the  Priest  readeth  the  following. 


The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (1:39-56) 

yi  ND  Mary  arose  in  those  days;  and  went  into  the 
hill  country  with  haste  into  a  city  of  Juda. 
And  entered  into  the  house  of  Zacharias,  and  saluted 
Elisabeth. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  when  Elisabeth  heard  the 
salutation  of  Mary,  the  babe  leaped  in  her  womb;  and 
Elisabeth  was  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost: 


Prayers  of  the  Paracletice  51 

And  she  spake  out  with  a  loud  voice,  and  said, 
Blessed  art  thou  among  women,  and  blessed  is  the  fruit 
of  thy  womb. 

And  whence  is  this  to  me,  that  the  mother  of  my 
Lord  should  come  to  me? 

For,  lo,  as  soon  as  the  voice  of  thy  salutation  sounded 
in  mine  ears,  the  babe  leaped  in  my  womb  for  joy. 

And  blessed  is  she  that  believed :  for  there  shall  be  a 
performance  of  those  things  which  were  told  her  from 
the  Lord. 

And  Mary  said.  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord. 

And  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in  God  my  Saviour. 

For  he  hath  regarded  the  low  estate  of  his  hand- 
maiden: for,  behold,  from  henceforth  all  generations 
shall  call  me  blessed. 

For  he  that  is  mighty  hath  done  to  me  great  things; 
and  holy  is  his  name. 

And  his  mercy  is  on  them  that  fear  him  from  genera- 
tion to  generation. 

He  hath  showed  strength  with  his  arm;  he  hath  scat- 
tered the  proud  in  the  imagination  of  their  hearts. 

He  hath  put  down  the  mighty  from  their  seats,  and 
exalted  them  of  low  degree. 

He  hath  filled  the  hungry  with  good  things;  and  the 
rich  he  hath  sent  empty  away. 

He  hath  received  his  servant  Israel,  being  mindful 
of  his  mercy. 

And  he  spake  to  our  fathers,  to  Abraham,  and  to  his 
seed  for  ever.

unable  to  bear  the  darts  of  Satan.  We  are  without 
shelter,  and  know  not  where*  to  seek  for  refuge,  being 
wretched  and  assailed  on  every  side.  We  have  no  solace 
save  in  thee.  Wherefore,  O  Lady  of  the  world,  O  hope 
and  intercession  of  believers,  turn  not  away  from  our 
petitions,  but  perform  that  which  profiteth  us. 

Verily,  no  one  hasteneth  to  thee,  and  goeth  away 
confounded,  O  pure  virgin  Theotokos,  but  seeketh 
grace  and  receiveth  gifts  in  accordance  with  his 
petition. 

O  virgin  Theotokos,  thou  art  the  solace  of  the  dis- 
tressed, the  healer  of  the*  sick.  Deliver  thou  therefore 
thy  people  and  thy  city,  O  safety  of  those  who  are 
attacked,  O  haven  and  calm  of  those  encompassed  by 
rain,  who  art  alone  the  intercessor  of  believers.

Seventh  Ode 

\/ERILY,  when  the  youths  from  Judaea  came  to 
Babylon  of  olden  times,  they  trod  the  flames  of  the 
furnace  in  the  faith  of  the  Trinity,  singing.  Blessed  art 
thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

When  thou  didst  deign  to  institute  our  salvation,  thou 
didst  dwell  in  the  womb  of  the  Virgin,  whom  thou 
didst  reveal  as  an  intercessor  for  the  world.  Blessed 
art  thou,  therefore,  O  God  of  our  fathers. 

Pray,  O  pure  Mother,  thy  mercy-bound  Son,  to 
whom  thou  didst  give  birth,  to  deliver  from  transgres- 
sions and  impurities  the  souls  of  those  who  cry  in  faith. 
Blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

A  treasury  of  salvation,  a  fount  of  incorruption,  a 
fortified  tower,  a  door  of  repentance,  thou  didst  reveal 
thy  Mother  to  those  who  cry  unto  thee,  Blessed  art  thou, 
God  of  our  Fathers. 

O  Theotokos,  who  didst  give  birth  to  Christ  the  Sav- 
iour, prepare  us  who  hasten  anxiously  to  the  wing  of 
thy  divine  protection,  for  healing  from  the  ills  of  body 
and  soul.

^  angels  praise;  exalt  him  yet  more  throughout  the 

ages. 

Turn  not  away,  O  virgin  Maiden,  from  those  who 
seek  succour  of  thee,  who  praise  and  exalt  thee  through- 
out the  ages. 

Thou  dost  pour,  O  Virgin,  thy  healing  abundantly 
on  those  who  praise  thee  in  faith,  adding  exaltation  to 
thine  inef^fable  birth-giving. 

Thou  dost  heal,  O  Virgin,  the  ills  of  our  souls  and 
the  pains  of  our  bodies.  Wherefore,  do  we  glorify  thee, 
O  full  of  grace. 

Thou  dost  drive  away  from  us,  O  Virgin,  the  attacks 
of  temptation,  and  the  sources  of  passion.  Wherefore, 
we  praise  thee  throughout  the  ages. 

Ninth  Ode 

V\7E,  O  immaculate  Virgin,  who  have  been  saved 
^^  through  thee,  do  confess  that  thou  art  the  Theo- 
tokos  in  truth,  and  magnify  thee  with  the  chorus  of  the 
incorporals. 

Refuse  not,  O  Virgin,  the  stream  of  our  tears,  O  thou 
who  didst  give  birth  to  Christ,  who  wiped  from  all 
faces  every  tear. 

Fill,  O  Virgin,  our  hearts  with  joy,  O  thou  who  didst 
receive  the  fullness  of  joy,  and  remove  from  us  the 
sorrow  of  sin. 

Be  thou,  O  Virgin,  to  those  who  seek  refuge  in  thee, 
a  haven,  a  protection,  an  unshakeable  wall,  a  refuge,  a 
shelter,  and  a  joy. 

Illuminate,  O  Virgin,  with  the  rays  of  thy  light  those 
who  proclaim  in  true  worship  that  thou  art  the  Theo- 
tokos.    Put  away  from  them  the  darkness  of  folly. 

Having  abased  ourselves,  O  Virgin,  in  the  home  of 
wretchedness  and  ills,  heal  us,  translating  us  from  afflic- 
tions to  health.

L-IOW  lovely  are  thy  tabernacles,  O  Lord  of  hosts! 
My  soul  longeth  and  fainteth  for  the  courts  of  the 
Lord.  My  heart  and  my  flesh  have  rejoiced  in  the  liv-

For  the  sparrow  hath  found  herself  a  house,  and  the 
turtle  a  nest  for  herself  where  she  may  lay  her  young 
ones :  Thy  altars,  O  Lord  of  hosts,  my  king  and  my  God. 

Blessed  are  they  that  dwell  in  thy  house,  O  Lord : 
they  shall  praise  thee  for  ever  and  ever. 

Blessed  is  the  man  whose  help  is  from  thee:  in  his 
heart  he  hath  disposed  to  ascend  by  steps,  in  the  vale 
of  tears,  in  the  place  which  he  hath  set. 

For  the  lawgiver  shall  give  a  blessing,  they  shall  go

He  will  not  deprive  of  good  things  them  that  walk

trusteth  in  thee. 

Psalm  84 

T  ORD,  thou  hast  blessed  thy  land:  thou  hast  turned 
^■-^away  the  captivity  of  Jacob. 

Thou  hast  forgiven  the  iniquity  of  thy  people:  thou 
hast  covered  all  their  sins. 

Thou  hast  mitigated  all  thy  anger:  thou  hast  turned 
away  from  the  wrath  of  thy  indignation. 

Convert  us,  O  God  our  Saviour:  and  turn  ofiP  thy 
anger  from  us. 

Wilt  thou  be  angry  with  us  for  ever:  or  wilt  thou 
extend  thy  wrath  from  generation  to  generation? 

Thou  wilt  turn,  O  God,  and  bring  us  to  life:  and 
thy  people  shall  rejoice  in  thee. 

Shew  us,  O  Lord,  thy  mercy;  and  grant  us  thy  sal- 
vation. 

I  will  hear  what  the  Lord  God  will  speak  in  me:  for 
he  will  speak  peace  unto  his  people: 

And  unto  his  saints;  and  unto  them  that  are  converted 
to  the  heart. 

Surely  his  salvation  is  near  to  them  that  fear  him: 
that  glory  may  dwell  in  our  land. 

Mercy  and  truth  have  met  each  other:  justice  and

Preserve  my  soul,  for  I  am  holy:  save  thy  servant, 
O  my  God,  that  trusteth  in  thee.

because  thou  hast  heard  me. 

There  is  none  among  the  gods  like  unto  thee,  O  Lord : 
and  there  is  none  according  to  thy  works. 

All  the  nations  thou  hast  made  shall  come  and  adore 
before  thee,  O  Lord :  and  they  shall  glorify  thy  name. 

For  thou  art  great  and  doest  wonderful  things :  thou 
art  God  alone. 

Conduct  me,  O  Lord,  in  thy  way,  and  I  will  walk  in 
thy  truth  :  let  my  heart  rejoice  that  it  may  fear  thy  name. 

I  will  praise  thee,  O  Lord  my  God,  with  my  whole 
heart,  and  I  will  glorify  thy  name  for  ever: 

For  thy  mercy  is  great  towards  me :  and  thou  hast 
delivered  my  soul  out  of  the  lower  hell. 

O  God,  the  wicked  are  risen  up  against  me,  and  the 
assembly  of  the  mighty  have  sought  my  soul :  and  they 
have  not  set  thee  before  their  eyes. 

And  thou,  O  Lord,  art  a  God  of  compassion,  and

into  paradise  for  the  penitent  thief,  and  by  Death  didst 
destroy  death,  cleanse  us  sinners,  thine  unworthy  ser- 
vants; for  we  have  sinned  and  have  dealt  iniquitously, 
and  we  are  not  worthy  to  lift  up  our  eyes  and  look  upon 
the  heights  of  heaven,  inasmuch  as  we  have  departed

thy  boundless  goodness.  Spare  us,  O  Lord,  according

THE  GENERAL  VESPER  PRAYERS 

^The  Priest,  standing  before  the  Holy  Table  and  wearing  the  Stole, 
maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross  three  times,  and  saith  secretly,  O  God, 
forgive  me  a  sinner.     Then  aloud: 

r>LESSED  be  God,  our  God,  always,  now,  and  ever, 
and  unto  ages  of  ages. 

Lector.  Amen.  O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down 
to  our  King  and  God. 

O  come,  let  us  worship  and  fall  down  to  Christ  our

ilThen  immediately  the  following  Vesper  Psalms. 

Psalm  103 

r)LESS  the  Lord,  O  my  soul:  O  Lord  my  God,  thou 

art  exceedingly  great.    Thou  hast  put  on  praise  and 

beauty:  and  art  clothed  with  light  as  with  a  garment. 

Who  stretchest  out  the  heaven  like  a  pavilion:  who 

coverest  the  higher  rooms  thereof  with  water. 


I 


General  Vesper  Prayers  63 

Who  makest  the  clouds  thy  chariot:  who  walkest 
upon  the  wings  of  the  winds. 

Who  makest  thy  angels  spirits:  and  thy  ministers  a 
burning  fire. 

Who  hast  founded  the  earth  upon  its  own  bases:  it 
shall  not  be  moved  for  ever  and  ever. 

The  deep  like  a  garment  is  its  clothing:  above  the 
mountains  shall  the  waters  stand. 

At  thy  rebuke  they  shall  flee:  at  the  voice  of  thy 
thunder  they  shall  fear. 

The  mountains  ascend,  and  the  plains  descend  into 
the  place  which  thou  hast  founded  for  them. 

Thou  hast  set  a  bound  which  they  shall  not  pass  over ; 
neither  shall  they  return  to  cover  the  earth. 

Thou  sendest  forth  springs  in  the  vales:  between  the 
midst  of  the  hills  the  waters  shall  pass. 

All  the  beasts  of  the  field  shall  drink:  the  wild  asses 
shall  expect  in  their  thirst. 

Over  them  the  birds  of  the  air  shall  dwell:  from  the 
midst  of  the  rocks  they  shall  give  forth  their  voices. 

Thou  waterest  the  hills  from  thy  upper  rooms:  the 
earth  shall  be  filled  with  the  fruit  of  thy  works: 

Bringing  forth  grass  for  cattle,  and  herb  for  the 
service  of  men. 

That  thou  mayest  bring  bread  out  of  the  earth:  and 
that  wine  may  cheer  the  heart  of  man. 

That  he  may  make  the  face  cheerful  with  oil:  and 
that  bread  may  strengthen  man's  heart. 

The  trees  of  the  field  shall  be  filled,  and  the  cedars 
of  Libanus  which  he  hath  planted:  there  the  sparrows 
shall  make  their  nests. 

The  highest  of  them  is  the  house  of  the  heron.  The 
high  hills  are  a  refuge  for  the  harts,  the  rock  for  the 
irchins. 

He  hath  made  the  moon  for  seasons :  the  sun  knoweth 
his  going  down. 

Thou  hast  appointed  darkness,  and  it  is  night:  in  it 
shall  all  the  beasts  of  the  woods  go  about: 


64  General  Vesper  Prayers 

The  young  lions  roaring  after  their  prey,  and  seeking 
their  meat  from  God. 

The  sun  ariseth,  and  they  are  gathered  together:  and 
they  shall  lie  down  in  their  dens. 

Man  shall  go  forth  to  his  work,  and  to  his  labour 
until  the  evening. 

How  great  are  thy  works,  O  Lord!  thou  hast  made 
all  things  in  wisdom :  The  earth  is  filled  with  thy  riches. 

So  is  this  great  sea,  which  stretcheth  wide  its  arms: 
there  are  creeping  things  without  number: 

Creatures  little  and  great.    There  the  ships  shall  go 

This  sea-dragon  which  thou  hast  formed  to  play 
therein.  All  expect  of  thee  that  thou  give  them  food 
in  season. 

What  thou  givest  to  them  they  shall  gather  up :  when 
thou  openest  thy  hand,  they  shall  all  be  filled  with  good. 

But  if  thou  turnest  away  thy  face,  they  shall  be 
troubled:  thou  shalt  take  away  their  breath,  and  they 
shall  fail,  and  shall  return  to  their  dust. 

Thou  shalt  send  forth  thy  spirit,  and  they  shall  be 
created:  and  thou  shalt  renew  the  face  of  the  earth. 

May  the  glory  of  the  Lord  endure  for  ever:  the  Lord 
shall  rejoice  in  his  works. 

He  looketh  upon  the  earth,  and  maketh  it  tremble: 
he  toucheth  the  mountains,  and  they  smoke. 

I  will  sing  to  the  Lord  as  long  as  I  live:  I  will  sing 
praise  to  my  God  while  I  have  my  being. 

Let  my  speech  be  acceptable  to  him:  but  I  will  take 
delight  in  the  Lord. 

Let  sinners  be  consumed  out  of  the  earth,  and  the 
unjust,  so  that  they  be  no  more:  O  my  soul,  bless  thou 
the  Lord. 

The  sun  knoweth  his  going  down.  Thou  hast  ap- 
pointed darkness,  and  it  is  night. 

How  great  are  thy  works,  O  Lord!  Thou  hast  made 
all  things  in  wisdom.

the  Psalms,  as  followeth. 

Psalm  1 

T)LESSED  is  the  man  who  hath  not  walked  in  the 
^^  counsel  of  the  ungodly,  nor  stood  in  the  way  of  sin- 
ners, nor  sat  in  the  chair  of  pestilence. 

But  his  will  is  in  the  law  of  the  Lord,  and  on  his  law 
he  shall  meditate  day  and  night. 

And  he  shall  be  like  a  tree  which  is  planted  near  the 
running  waters,  which  shall  bring  forth  its  fruit,  in 
due  season. 

And  his  leaf  shall  not  fall  off:  and  all  whatsoever 
he  shall  do  shall  prosper. 

Not  so  the  wicked,  not  so:  but  like  the  dust,  which 
the  wind  driveth  from  the  face  of  the  earth. 

Therefore  the  wicked  shall  not  rise  again  in  judg- 
ment: nor  sinners  in  the  council  of  the  just. 

For  the  Lord  knoweth  the  way  of  the  just:  and  the 
way  of  the  wicked  shall  perish. 

Psalm  2 

Y\/^HY  have  the  Gentiles  raged,  and  the  people  de- 
vised vain  things? 

The  kings  of  the  earth  stood  up,  and  the  princes  met 
together,  against  the  Lord,  and  against  his  Christ. 

Let  us  break  their  bonds  asunder:  and  let  us  cast 
away  their  yoke  from  us. 

He  that  dwelleth  in  heaven  shall  laugh  at  them :  and 


General  Vesper  Prayers  67 

the  Lord  shall  deride  them. 

Then  shall  he  speak  to  them  in  his  anger,  and  trouble 
them  in  his  rage. 

But  I  am  appointed  king  by  him  over  Sion  his  holy 
mountain,  preaching  his  commandment. 

The  Lord  hath  said  to  me:  Thou  art  my  son,  this 
day  have  I  begotten  thee. 

Ask  of  me,  and,  I  will  give  thee  the  Gentiles  for  thy 
inheritance,  and  the  utmost  parts  of  the  earth  for  thy 
possession. 

Thou  shalt  rule  them  w^ith  a  rod  of  iron,  and  shalt 
break  them  in  pieces  like  a  potter's  vessel. 

And  now,  O  ye  kings,  understand :  receive  instruc- 
tion, you  that  judge  the  earth. 

Serve  ye  the  Lord  with  fear:  and  rejoice  unto  him 
with  trembling. 

Embrace  discipline,  lest  at  any  time  the  Lord  be 
angry,  and  you  perish  from  the  just  way.

VX7HY,  O  Lord,  are  they  multiplied  that  afflict  me? 
'many  are  they  who  rise  up  against  me. 

Many  say  to  my  soul:  There  is  no  salvation  for  him 
in  his  God. 

But  thou,  O  Lord,  art  my  protector,  my  glory,  and 
the  lifter  up  of  my  head. 

I  have  cried  to  the  Lord  with  my  voice:  and  he  hath 
heard  me  from  his  holy  hill. 

I  have  slept  and  have  taken  my  rest;  and  I  have  risen 
up,  because  the  Lord  hath  protected  me. 

I  will  not  fear  thousands  of  the  people,  surrounding 
me.    Arise,  O  Lord;  save  me  O  my  God. 

For  thou  hast  struck  all  them  who  are  my  adversaries 
without  cause.    Thou  hast  broken  the  teeth  of  sinners.

was  no  man  that  would  know  me:  refuge  failed  me; 
no  man  cared  for  my  soul. 

I  cried  unto  thee,  O  Lord  :  I  said.  Thou  art  my  refuge 
and  my  portion  in  the  land  of  the  living. 

Attend  unto  my  cry;  for  I   am  brought  very  low: 

Deliver  me  from  my  persecutors;  for  they  are  strong- 
er than  I. 

Bring  my  soul  out  of  prison,  that  I  may  praise  ihy 
name. 

^After  this  Stichos,  chant  ten  Stichera. 

The  righteous  shall  compass  me  about;  for  thou  shalt 
deal  bountifully  with  me. 


Psalm  129 

/^UT  of  the  depths  have  I  cried  unto  thee,  O  Lord. 
^^^  Lord,  hear  my  voice.   Eight  Stichera. 

Let  thine  ears  be  attentive  to  the  voice  of  my  suppli- 
cations. 

If  thou.  Lord,  shouldest  mark  iniquities,  O  Lord, 
who  shall  stand?  But  there  is  forgiveness  with  thee, 
that  thou  mayest  be  feared.   Six  Stichera. 

I  wait  for  the  Lord,  my  soul  doth  wait,  and  in  his 
word  do  I  hope.     My  soul  waiteth  for  the  Lord. 

More  than  they  that  watch  for  the  morning:  I  say, 
more  than  they  that  watch  for  the  morning. 

Let  Israel  hope  in  the  Lord.  Four  Stichera.  For 
with  the  Lord  there  is  mercy,  and  with  him  is  plen- 
teous redemption. 

And  he  shall  redeem  Israel  from  all  his  iniquities.

In  that  we  now  are  come  unto  the  setting  of  the  sun,

to  the  middle  of  the  church  where  the  five  loaves,  with  wheat,  winCj 
and  oil,  are  placed  on  a  candle-lighted  table.  Then  the  Deacon  deliv- 
ereth  the  censer  to  the  sexton,  and  lifteth  the  end  of  his  girdle  with 
his  right  hand,  saying  in  a  loud  voice:

^As  the  Priest  chanteth  the  above  Troparion,  the  Deacon  proceeds 
around  the  table  zcith  him,  keeping  always  opposite,  with  a  candle

Choir.    Lord,  have  mercy. 

Priest.  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  who  didst  bless 
the  five  loaves  in  the  wilderness  and  therefrom  didst 
satisfy  five  thousand,  bless  thou  also  these  loaves,  and 
this  wheat,  wine,  and  oil,  and  make  them  plentiful  in 
this  city  and  in  all  the  world.  Sanctify  the  believers 
who  partake  thereof  in  faith;  for  it  is  thou,  O  Christ 
our  God,  who  dost  bless  and  sanctify  all  things;  and  to 
thee  do  we  address  glory,  together  with  thy  Father  who 
hath  no  beginning,  and  thy  most  good  and  Holy  Spirit,

CThen  the  Priest  taketh  one  of  the  loaves,  kisseth  it,  and  breaketh 
it  slightly  on  each  side  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  as  he  chanteth  the  fol- 
lowing Stichos,  in  the  Seventh  Tone. 

The  rich  have  wanted,  and  suffered  hunger:  but  they 
that  seek  the  Lord  shall  not  be  deprived  of  any  good. 

^The  above  Stichos  is  repeated  once  by  each  of  the  two  Choirs.  Then

Psalm  SO 

l-JAVE  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  according  to  thy 
great  mercy. 

And  according  to  the  multitude  of  thy  tender  mercies 
blot  out  my  iniquity. 

Wash  me  yet  more  from  my  iniquity,  and  cleanse  me 
from  my  sin. 

For  I  know  my  iniquity,  and  my  sin  is  always  before 
me. 

To  thee  only  have  I  sinned,  and  have  done  evil  before 
thee:  that  thou  mayest  be  justified  in  thy  words,  and 
mayest  overcome  when  thou  art  judged. 

For  behold  I  was  conceived  in  iniquities;  and  in  sins 
did  my  mother  conceive  me. 

For  behold  thou  hast  loved  truth :  the  uncertain  and 
hidden  things  of  thy  wisdom  thou  hast  made  manifest 
to  me. 

Thou  shalt  sprinkle  me  with  hyssop,  and  I  shall  be 
cleansed:  thou  shalt  wash  me,  and  I  shall  be  made 
whiter  than  snow. 

To  my  hearing  thou  shalt  give  joy  and  gladness:  and 
the  bones  that  have  been  humbled  shall  rejoice. 

Turn  away  thy  face  from  my  sins,  and  blot  out  all 
my  iniquities. 

Create  a  clean  heart  in  me,  O  God :  and  renew  a  right 
spirit  within  my  bowels. 

Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  face;  and  take  not  thy 
holy  spirit  from  me. 

Restore  unto  me  the  joy  of  thy  salvation,  and  strength- 
en me  with  a  perfect  spirit. 

I  will  teach  the  unjust  thy  ways :  and  the  wicked  shall 
be  converted  to  thee. 


Little  Compline  83 

Deliver  me  from  blood,  O  God,  thou  God  of  my 
salvation:  and  my  tongue  shall  extol  thy  justice. 

O  Lord,  thou  wilt  open  my  lips:  and  my  mouth  shall 
declare  thy  praise. 

For  if  thou  hadst  desired  sacrifice,  I  would  indeed 
have  given  it:  with  burnt  offerings  thou  wilt  not  be 
delighted. 

A  sacrifice  to  God  is  an  afflicted  spirit:  a  contrite  and 
humbled  heart,  O  God,  thou  wilt  not  despise. 

Deal  favourably,  O  Lord,  in  thy  good  will  with  Sion; 
that  the  walls  of  Jerusalem  may  be  built  up. 

Then  shalt  thou  accept  the  sacrifice  of  justice,  obla-

calves  upon  thy  altar. 

Psalm  69

Let  them  be  confounded  and  ashamed  that  seek  my 
soul: 

Let  them  be  turned  backward,  and  blush  for  shame 
that  desire  evils  to  me : 

Let  them  be  presently  turned  away  blushing  for 
shame  that  say  to  me:  Tis  well,  'tis  well. 

Let  all  that  seek  thee  rejoice  and  be  glad  in  thee;  and 
let  such  as  love  thy  salvation  say  always :  The  Lord  be 
magnified. 

But  I  am  needy  and  poor;  O  God,  help  me.

no  delay.

cation in  thy  truth:  hear  me  in  thy  justice. 
And  enter  not  into  judgment  with  thy  servant:  for  in 
thy  sight  no  man  living  shall  be  justified. 

For  the  enemy  hath  persecuted  my  soul :  he  hath 
brought  down  my  life  to  the  earth.

He  hath  made  me  to  dwell  in  darkness  as  those  that 
have  been  dead  of  old:  and  my  spirit  is  in  anguish 
within  me:  my  heart  within  me  is  troubled. 

I  remembered  the  days  of  old,  I  meditated  upon  the 
works  of  thy  hands. 

I  stretched  forth  my  hands  to  thee:  my  soul  is  as 
earth  without  water  unto  thee. 

Hear  me  speedily  O  Lord:  my  spirit  hath  fainted 
away. 

Turn  not  away  thy  face  from  me,  lest  I  be  like  unto 
them  that  go  down  into  the  pit. 

Cause  me  to  hear  thy  mercy  in  the  morning;  for  in 
thee  have  I  hoped. 

Make  the  way  known  to  me,  wherein  I  should  walk: 
for  I  have  lifted  up  my  soul  to  thee. 

Deliver  me  from  my  enemies,  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I 
fled :  teach  me  to  do  thy  will,  for  thou  art  my  God. 

Thy  good  spirit  shall  lead  me  into  the  right  land. 
For  thy  name's  sake,  O  Lord,  thou  wilt  quicken  me 
in  thy  justice. 

Thou  wilt  bring  my  soul  out  of  trouble:  and  in  thy 
mercy  thou  wilt  destroy  my  enemies. 

And  thou  wilt  cut  off  all  them  that  afflict  my  soul: 
for  I  am  thy  servant. 

Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  and 
good  will  toward  men. 

We  praise  thee,  we  bless  thee,  we  worship  thee,  we 
glorify  thee,  we  give  thanks  unto  thee  for  the  splendour 
of  thy  glory. 

O  Lord,  O  King,  O  heavenly  God,  Father  Almighty: 
O  Lord,  O  only-begotten  Son  Jesus  Christ,  and  the 
Holy  Spirit. 

O  Lord  God,  O  Lamb  of  God,  O  Son  of  the  Father, 
that  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  world,  have  mercy  upon 
us,  O  thou  that  takest  away  the  sins  of  the  world. 

Accept  our  prayers,  O  thou  that  sittest  on  the  right 
hand  of  the  Father,  and  have  mercy  upon  us. 

For  thou  only  art  holy,  thou  only  art  the  Lord  Jesus

Christ,  in  the  glory  of  God  the  Father.    Amen. 

Every  day  will  1  bless  thee  and  will  praise  thy  Name 
for  ever  and  ever. 

O  Lord,  thou  hast  been  our  refuge  from  generation 
to  generation.  I  said,  Lord,  have  mercy  upon  me,  heal 
my  soul;  for  I  have  sinned  against  thee. 

O  Lord,  I  flee  unto  thee,  teach  me  to  do  thy  will;  for 
thou  art  my  God;  for  with  thee  is  the  Fountain  of  life, 
and  in  thy  light  we  shall  see  light. 

Extend  thy  mercy  unto  them  that  know  thee. 

Vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  to  keep  us  this  night  without  sin. 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  Fathers,  and 
praised  and  glorified  is  thy  Name  for  ever.    Amen. 

Let  thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  be  upon  us,  as  we  have  set 
our  trust  in  thee.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord,  teach  me 
thy  commandments.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Master,  make 
me  to  understand  thy  statutes.  Blessed  art  thou,  O 
holy  One,  enlighten  me  with  thy  justice. 

Thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  is  for  ever;  turn  not  away  from 
the  works  of  thy  hands.  To  thee  belongeth  praise;  lau- 
dation becometh  thee;  to  thee  glory  is  due;  O  Father, 
Son,  and  Holy  Spirit,  now,  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.    Amen.

It  is  truly  meet  to  bless  the  Theotokos,  who  is  ever-

O  thou  who  art  more  honourable  than  the  cherubim,

who  without  corruption  didst  bear  the  Word  of  God;

SPOTLESS,  undefiled,  unstained,  all-chaste,  and 
pure  Lady,  blameless  bride  of  God,  who  by  thy 
glorious  birth-giving  hast  united  the  Word  of  God  with 
man  and  linked  our  fallen  nature  with  heavenly  beings, 
who  art  alone  the  hope  of  the  hopeless,  the  helper  of 
those  attacked,  the  ready  protection  of  those  who  hasten 
unto  thee,  and  the  refuge  of  all  Christians;  despise  not 
me  a  sinner,  wholly  defiled  by  evil  thoughts,  words, 
and  deeds,  become  by  slothful  will  a  servant  of  life's 
pleasures.  But  being  Mother  of  God,  the  lover  of  man- 
kind, have  mercy,  in  compassion,  upon  me,  thy  sinful 
and  prodigal  servant.  Accept  this  prayer  which  is 
offered  to  thee  from  my  impure  lips  and,  putting  forth 
thy  maternal  favour  with  thy  Son,  our  Lord  and  Master, 
beseech  him  to  open  unto  me  the  wings  of  his  love  of 
mankind,  his  loving  kindness  and  bounty.  Beseech  him 
to  pass  over  my  numberless  transgressions,  to  lead  me 
back  to  true  repentance,  and  to  make  me  a  keeper  of  his 
commandments  and  a  tried  doer  thereof.  And  as  thou 
art  gracious,  compassionate,  and  tender-hearted,  be 
thou  ever  present  with  me  in  this  life  as  my  advocate 
and  helper,  to  turn  aside  the  evil  assaults  of  my  adver- 
saries, to  guide  me  unto  salvation,  and  at  the  departure 
of  my  wretched  soul,  encompass  me,  and  drive  from  it 
all  the  dark  forms  of  the  evil  ones;  and  in  the  dreadful 
Judgment  Day  deliver  me  from  everlasting  punish-

And  raise  us  up  again  at  the  hour  of  prayer,  established

CANON  OF  THE  METALEPSIS,  OR  DIVINE 
COMMUNION 

^When  you  are  about  to  receive  the  divine  Mysteries,  after  reading 
the  Little  Compline  {p.  82)  to  the  end  of,  I  believe  in  one  God,  etc., 
say  contritely  the  following  Canon. 

First  Ode,  I?i  the  Second  Tone 

r\  COMPASSIONATE  Lord,  may  thy  holy  Body 
^^^  and  thy  precious  Blood  become  the  bread  of  ever- 
lasting life  to  me,  and  the  healing  of  manifold  diseases. 

Defiled  as  I  am,  O  Christ,  by  unbecoming  deeds,  I 
am  not  worthy  of  the  communion  orf  thy  most  pure  Body 
and  divine  Blood.  Nevertheless,  make  thou  me  worthy 
thereof. 

O  thou  most  blessed  bride  of  God,  the  good  soil 
which  grew  the  untilled  corn  that  saveth  the  world; 
grant  that  partaking  thereof  I  may  be  saved. 

Third  Ode 

CTABLISHING  me  on  the  rock  of  faith,  thou  hast 
enlarged  my  mouth  against  mine  enemies;  for  my 
soul  hath  rejoiced  to  sing.  There  is  none  holy  as  the 
Lord  our  God,  nor  any  just  save  thee,  O  Lord. 

O  Christ,  Master,  give  me  those  tearful  drops  which 
cleanse  my  heart's  impurity,   that,  with  a   pure  con- 


Metalepsis  91 

science,  I  may  approach  with  faith  and  fear  the  com- 
munion of  thy  divine  gifts. 

O  thou  Lover  of  mankind,  may  thy  most  pure  Body 
and  divine  Blood  be  for  the  remission  of  my  sins,  for 
the  communion  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  for  life  everlasting, 
and  for  estrangement  from. passions  and  afflictions. 

O  thou  most  holy  table  of  the  bread  of  life,  which, 
for  mercy's  sake,  came  from  above  and  giveth  new  life 
unto  the  world;  grant  that  I  may  now,  unworthy  as  I 
am,  taste  thereof  in  fear  and  live  thereby. 

Fourth  Ode 

r\  MOST  merciful  One,  when  thou  didst  take  flesh 
^^^  for  our  sake,  thou  wast  willing  to  be  slain  as  a 
lamb  for  the  sins  of  men.  Wherefore,  I  beseech  thee, 
cleanse  my  sins  also. 

O  Lord,  heal  the  wounds  of  my  soul  and  sanctify  me 
wholly,  and  grant,  O  Master,  that  I,  wretched  man, 
may  partake  of  thy  divine  and  mystical  supper. 

O  Lady,  propitiate  in  my  behalf  him  who  was  born 
of  thee,  and  preserve  me,  thy  supplicating  servant,  pure 
and  undefiled,  so  that  by  receiving  the  supersensuous 
pearl  I  may  be  sanctified. 

Fifth  Ode 

A  S  thou,  O  Christ,  didst  foretell,  so  let  it  be  unto 
^^^  thine  unprofitable  servant,  and  abide  in  me,  as 
thou  didst  promise;  for  lo!  I  eat  thy  divine  Body  and 
drink  thy  precious  Blood. 

O  God  and  Word  of  God,  may  the  live  coal  of  thy 
Body  be  to  the  enlightenment  of  my  darkness,  and  thy 
Blood  to  the  cleansing  of  my  defiled  soul. 

O  Mary,  Theotokos,  thou  honourable  tabernacle  of 
sweet  ointment;  make  me,  by  thy  prayers,  a  chosen  ves- 
sel, that  I  may  receive  the  sanctification  of  thy  Son. 


92  Metalepsis 

Sixth  Ode 

O   SAVIOUR,  sanctify  my  mind,  my  soul,  my  heart, 
and  my  body,  and  prepare  me,  O  Lord,  to  ap- 
proach uncondemned  thy  dread  mysteries. 

Grant  that  I  may  be  rid  of  my  passions,  increase  in 
thy  grace,  and  be  confirmed'  in  my  life  by  the  commun- 
ion of  thy  holy  mysteries,  O  Christ. 

O  God,  O  holy  Word  of  God,  wholly  sanctify  me 
now  approaching  thy  divine  mysteries,  through  the 
supplications  of  thy  holy  Mother. 

Kontakion 

T^URN  not  away  from  me  wretched  man,  O  Christ, 
^  Master,  as  I  now  receive  thy  dread  mysteries,  thy 
pure  Body  and  thy  precious  Blood.  Let  not  my  par- 
taking thereof  be  to  my  judgment,  but  to  everlasting 
and  immortal  life. 

Seventh  Ode 

r\  CHRIST,  Fountain  of  blessings,  may  the  com- 
^^^  munion  of  thine  immortal  mysteries  now  be  to 
me  light  and  life,  freedom  from  passion,  and  for  my 
progress  and  increase  in  divine  virtues,  that  I  may 
glorify  thee  who  alone  art  good. 

Grant  that  now  approaching  thine  immortal  and  di- 
vine mysteries  in  trembling,  longing,  and  piety,  I  may 
be  delivered,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  from  passions  and 
enemies,  and  from  every  affliction,  distress,  and  sorrow, 
and  vouchsafe  that  I  may  sing  to  thee.  Blessed  art 
thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  Fathers. 

O  thou  God-favoured  one,  who  didst  above  compre- 
hension bear  the  Saviour  Christ,  I,  thine  impure  ser- 
vant, desiring  now  to  approach  the  most  pure  mysteries, 
pray  thee,  who  art  pure,  cleanse  me  from  all  defilement 
of  flesh  and  spirit. 


Metalepsis  93 

Eighth  Ode 

r\  CHRIST  God  my  Saviour,  grant  that  I  thy  des- 
^^^  pairing  servant  may  become  now  a  partaker  of  thy 
heavenly  dread  and  holy  mysteries,  and  of  thy  divine 
and  mystical  Supper. 

Seeking  refuge  in  thy  loving-kindness,  O  good  Sav- 
iour, I  cry  unto  thee  with  fear;  abide  in  me,  and  let  me 
also,  as  thou  didst  promise,  abide  in  thee;  for  lo!  trust- 
ing in  thy  mercy,  I  eat  thy  Body  and  I  drink  thy  Blood. 

I  tremble  in  taking  this  fire  lest  I  should  be  consumed 
as  wax  and  grass.  O  fearful  mystery!  O  the  loving- 
kindness  of  God!  How  is  it  that  I,  an  earthly  creature, 
partake  of  the  divine  Body  and  Blood,  and  am  made 
incorruptible? 

Ninth  Ode 

r\  TASTE  and  see  that  the  Lord  is  good,  who  for 
^^^  our  sake  was  made  like  unto  us  of  old,  and  once  for 
all  offered  up  himself  as  an  offering  to  his  Father,  and 
is  now  forever  slain,  sanctifying  the  communicants. 

O  Master,  let  me  be  sanctified  in  body  and  soul;  let 
me  be  enlightened  and  saved;  and  let  me  become  thy 
dwelling  through  the  communion  of  thy  holy  mysteries, 
having  thee,  O  most  merciful  Benefactor,  living  in  me, 
with  the  Father  and  the  Spirit. 

May  thy  Body  and  thy  precious  Blood,  O  Saviour, 
be  as  fire  and  light  to  me,  consuming  the  substance  of 
sin  and  burning  the  tares  of  my  passions,  and  wholly 
enlightening  me,  that  I  may  fall  down,  worshipping 
thy  Divinity. 

God  took  flesh  from  thy  pure  blood.  Therefore,  do 
all  generations  praise  thee,  O  Lady,  and  the  hosts  of 
supersensuous  powers  glorify  thee;  for  through  thee 
they  clearly  behold  him  who  ruleth  all  things  endued 
with  human  nature. 

^And  immediately,  It  is  truly  meet  to  bless  thee,  etc.,  and  the  rest

that  afflict  me. 

Thou  hast  anointed  my  head  with  oil ;  and  my  chalice 
which  inebriateth  me,  how  goodly  is  it! 

And  thy  mercy  will  follow  me  all  the  days  of  my  life. 

And  that  I  may  dwell  in  the  house  of  the  Lord  unto 
length  of  days. 

Psalm  23 

npHE  earth  is  the  Lord's  and  the  fulness  thereof:  the 
world,  and  all  they  that  dwell  therein. 

For  he  hath  founded  it  upon  the  seas;  and  hath  pre- 
pared it  upon  the  rivers. 

Who  shall  ascend  into  the  mountain  of  the  Lord:  or 
who  shall  stand  in  his  holy  place? 

The  innocent  in  hands,  and  clean  of  heart,  who  hath 
not  taken  his  soul  in  vain,  nor  sworn  deceitfully  to  his 
neighbour. 

He  shall  receive  a  blessing  from  the  Lord,  and  mercy 
from  God  his  Saviour. 

This  is  the  generation  of  them  that  seek  him,  of  them 
that  seek  the  face  of  the  God  of  Jacob. 

Lift  up  your  gates,  O  ye  princes,  and  be  ye  lifted  up, 


Metalcpsis  95 

O  eternal  gates:  and  the  King  of  Glory  shall  enter  in. 

Who  is  this  King  of  Glory?  the  Lord  who  is  strong 
and  mighty:  the  Lord  mighty  in  battle. 

Lift  up  your  gates,  and  the  King  of  Glory  shall  enter 
in. 

Who  is  this  King  of  Glory?  the  Lord  of  hosts,  he  is 
the  King  of  Glory. 

Psalm  115 

T   HAVE,  believed,  therefore  have   I   spoken;  but  I 

have  been  humbled  exceedingly. 

What  shall  I  render  to  the  Lord,  for  all  the  things 
that  he  hath  rendered  to  me? 

I  will  take  the  chalice  of  salvation;  and  I  will  call 
upon  the  name  of  the  Lord. 

I  will  pay  my  vows  to  the  Lord  before  all  his  people : 
precious  in  the  sight  of  the  Lord  is  the  death  of  his 
saints. 

0  Lord,  for  I  am  thy  servant.  I  am  thy  servant,  and 
the  son  of  thy  handmaid. 

Thou  hast  broken  my  bonds :  I  will  sacrifice  to  thee 
the  sacrifice  of  praise,  and  I  will  call  upon  the  name  of 
the  Lord. 

1  will  pay  my  vows  to  the  Lord  in  the  sight  of  all  his 
people:  in  the  courts  of  the  house  of  the  Lord,  in  the 
midst  of  thee,  O  Jerusalem. 

CGlory  to  the  Father  {complete)  ;  Alleluia  {three  t'vnes) .  Glory  to

C\  LORD  who  wast  born  of  the  Virgin,  turn  away 
from  m*y  transgressions  and  purify  my  heart,  mak- 
ing it  a  temxple  for  thy  most  pure  Body  and  precious

who  hast  mercy  without  measure.

for  it  is  not  a  supper  garment,  and  I  shall  call  forth  the 
reproach  and  condemnation  of  my  most  sinful  soul. 
Wherefore,  cleanse,  O  Lord,  the  defilement  of  my  soul, 
and  save  me,  for  thou  art  a  lover  of  mankind. 

Now 
T>ECAUSE  of  the  multitude  of  my  transgressions,  I

tion. Visit  thou  mine  ailing  soul,  and  beseech  thy  Son 
and  our  God  to  grant  me  remission  of  the  evils  I  have 
wrought,  O  thou  blessed  one. 

^And  on  the  Holy  Great  Thursday  this   Troparion  is  chanted. 

npHE  glorified  Disciples,  being  illuminated,  at  the 
evening  washing,  Judas,  of  evil  worship,  was  stric- 
ken and  darkened  with  the  love  of  silver.  And  to  law- 
less judges,  O  righteous  Judaic,  he  delivered  and  sur- 
rendered thee.  Wherefore,  O  lover  of  wealth,  behold 
him  who  for  its  sake  hanged  himself,  and  ran  away 
from  the  insatiable  soul  which  ventured  to  that  extent 
against  the  Master.  O  thou  whose  goodness  pervadeth 
all,  glory  to  thee,  O  Lord. 

^Then,  Lord,  have  mercy  (forty  times),  and  as  ?nany  genuflexions

HOW  YOU  SHOULD  COME   PREPARED  TO 
RECEIVE  THE  HOLY  MYSTERIES 

C.//  thou  hast  purposed,  O  man,  to  eat  the  Body  of  the  Lord,  ap- 
proach in  fear  lest  thou  be  scorched;  for  it  is  fire:  and,»before  drinking 
the  Divine  Blood  unto  communion,  first  reconcile  thyself  to  them  that 
have  wronged  thee,  then  venture  to  eat  that  mystical  Food.  Before 
partaking,  however,  of  the  fearful  Sacrifice  of  the  life-creating  Body 
of  the  Lord,  say  in  fear  and  reverence  the  following  Prayers. 

First  Prayer  by  Saint  Basil  the  Great 

C\  LORD  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  Source  of  life  and 
immortality,  Creator  of  all  things  visible  and  in- 


Metalepsis  97 

visible,  Son  coeternal  with  the  everlasting  Father,  who 
out  of  thy  great  loving-kindness  didst  in  the  last  days 
become  incarnate  and  wast  crucified  for  us  ungrateful 
and  thankless  men,  and  hast  renewed  with  thine  own 
Blood  our  nature  corrupted  by  sin,  do  thou  thyself,  im- 
mortal King,  accept  the  repentance  of  thy  sinful  ser- 
vant. Incline  thine  ear  towards  me  and  hearken  unto 
my  supplications;  for  I  have  sinned,  O  Lord,  I  have 
sinned  against  heaven  and  before  thee,  and  I  am  not 
worthy  to  raise  mine  eyes  to  the  height  of  thy  glory.  I 
have  also  angered  thy  goodness  by  transgressing  thy 
commandments  and  by  not  obeying  thine  ordinances. 
But  thou,  O  Lord,  who  art  long-suffering  and  of  great 
mercy,  hast  not  given  me  over  to  perish  in  my  sins,  but 
always  awaiteth  my  conversion;  for  thou  hast  said  by 
thy  Prophets,  O  thou  Lover  of  mankind,  that  thou  hast 
no  pleasure  in  the  death  of  a  sinner,  but  rather  that  he 
should  turn  back  and  live.  Thou  wiliest  not,  O  Lord, 
that  the  works  of  thy  hands  should  be  lost,  neither  hast 
thou  pleasure  in  the  perdition  of  men,  but  desirest  that 
all  should  be  saved  and  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the 
truth.  Therefore,  even  I  unworthy  of  heaven,  or  yet 
of  earth  and  of  this  temporal  life,  since  I  have  sub- 
mitted my  whole  self  to  sin  and  made  myself  a  slave 
of  pleasure,  defiling  thine  image,  but  being  still  thy 
creature  and  thy  handiwork,  have  not  despaired  of 
salvation,  reprobate  as  I  am;  and,  emboldened  by  thine 
immeasurable  compassion,  I  come  unto  thee.  Receive 
me  then,  even  me,  O  man-loving  Lord,  as  thou  didst 
receive  the  adulteress,  the  thief,  the  publican,  and  the 
prodigal. 

Take  away  the  heavy  load  of  my  sins,  O  thou  who 
takest  awav  the  sins  of  the  world,  who  healest  the  in- 
firmities of  men,  who  callest  unto  thyself  the  weary  and 
the  burdened  and  givest  them  rest,  who  camest  not  to 
call  the  righteous  but  sinners  to  repentance.  And  do 
thou  cleanse  me  from  every  defilement  of  the  flesh  and 
of  the  spirit,  and  teach  me  to  perfect  holiness  in  the 


98  Metalepsis 

fear  of  thee,  that,  in  the  pure  testimony  of  my  con- 
science, receiving  my  portion  of  thy  holy  thmgs,  I  may 
be  united  with  thy  holy  Body  and  precious  Blood,  and 
have  thee  to  dw^ell  and  remain  v^ithin  me,  with  the 
Father  and  thy  Holy  Spirit.  Yea,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
my  God,  grant  that  the  communion  of  thy  holy  and  life- 
giving  mysteries  may  not  be  to  my  condemnation;  nor 
let  me  be  afflicted  in  soul  and  body  by  partaking  thereof 
unworthily;  but  grant  me  unto  the  last  breath  of  my 
life  to  partake  uncondemned  of  my  share  of  thy  holy 
things,  looking  to  the  fellowship  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  to 
provision  for  life  eternal,  and  to  a  favourable  answer  at 
thy  terrible  judgment-seat;  that  I,  even  I,  may  also  be- 
come with  thine  elect  a  partaker  of  thine  incorruptible 
blessings,  which  thou  hast  prepared  for  those  who  love 
thee,  in  whom,  O  Lord,  thou  art  glorified  to  endless 
ages.    Amen. 

Second  Prayer  by  John  Chrysostom 

T  KNOW,  O  Lord  my  God,  that  I  am  not  worthy  nor 
sufficient  that  thou  shouldest  come  under  the  roof 
of  my  soul's  habitation;  for  it  is  all  deserted  and  in 
ruins,  and  thou  findest  not  in  me  where  worthily  to  lay 
thy  head.  But  as  from  the  height  of  thy  glory  thou 
didst  humble  thyself  for  us,  bear  now  also  with  my 
humility;  and  a^  thou  didst  deign  to  lay  thyself  down 
in  a  manger  of  dumb  beasts,  so  deign  now  also  to  enter 
into  the  manger  of  my  dumb  soul  and  defiled  body; 
and  as  thou  didst  not  refuse  to  enter  into  the  house  of 
Simon  the  leper  and  to  sup  there  with  sinners,  so  also 
deign  to  enter  the  habitation  of  my  humble  soul,  lep- 
rous and  sinful;  and  as  thou  didst  not  reject  the  sinful 
woman  who  approached  and  touched  thee,  so  also  have 
pity  on  me,  a  sinner,  coming  to  thee  and  touching  thee; 
and  as  thou  didst  not  despise  the  mouth  of  that  abomina- 
ble impure  one  when  he  kissed  thee,  so  also  despise  not 
my  more  defiled  mouth, unclean  lips, and  defiled  tongue; 
but  may  the  live  coal  of  thy  most  holy  Body  and  pre- 


I 


Metalepsis  99 


cious  Blood  be  for  the  sanctification,  enlightenment, 
and  strengthening  of  my  humble  soul  and  body,  for  the 
alleviation  of  the  burden  of  my  many  sins,  for  my  pres- 
ervation from  the  very  work  of  the  devil,  for  victory 
over  my  sinful  and  evil  habits,  for  the  mortification  of 
my  passions,  for  the  fulfillment  of  thy  commandments, 
for  the  increase  of  thy  divine  grace,  and  for  the  inherit- 
ance of  thy  kingdom;  for  it  is  not  in  lightness  of  heart, 
O  Christ  my  God,  that  I  venture  to  approach  thee,  but 
trusting  in  thine  inefifable  goodness,  and  in  the  fear, 
lest  being  drawn  far  from  thee,  I  become  the  prey  of  the 
beast  of  the  spirit.  Therefore  do  I  pray  thee,  O  Lord, 
who  alone  art  holy,  that  thou  wouldest  sanctify  my  soul 
and  body,  my  heart,  my  reins  and  mind,  and,  renewing 
me  entirely,  wouldest  implant  in  my  members  the  fear 
of  thee,  and  that  thou  let  not  thy  sanctification  be  im- 
pugned by  me.  Be  thou  my  help  and  guide,  governing 
my  life  in  the  ways  of  peace,  and  making  me  worthy 
to  obtain  with  thy  saints  a  place  at  thy  right  hand; 
through  the  prayers  and  supplications  of  thy  most  pure 
Mother,  of  thine  incorporeal  ministers  and  undefiled 
powers,  and  of  all  thy  saints  who  from  the  ages  have 
found  favour  with  thee.    Amen. 

Another  Prayer,  by  Simeon  the  Neo-Theologian 

r\  LORD,  Jesus  Christ,  the  Wisdom,  Peace,  and 
^"^  Power  of  God,  who  alone  art  undefiled  and  im- 
perishable, who  for  the  compassion  of  thine  inefifable 
love  to  mankind  didst  take  our  entire  nature  from  the 
pure  blood  of  the  Virgin,  the  blood  of  her  who  in  a 
supernatural  manner  didst  give  thee  birth  by  the  de- 
scent of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  pleasure  of  the  eternal 
Father,  who,  after  the  flesh  which  thou  didst  take,  didst 
accept  the  life-giving  Passion  of  salvation,  the  Cross, 
the  nails,  the  spear,  and  death;  deaden  the  soul-cor- 
rupting passions  of  my  body,  O  thou  who  by  thy  Burial 
didst  lead  captive  the  kingdom  of  hades.  Bury  under 
good  thoughts  my  evil  counsels,  O  thou  who  by  thy 


100  Metalepsis 

life-giving,  third-day  Resurrection  didst  raise  the  first 
parent  who  had  fallen,  disperse  from  me  the  evil  spirits ; 
lift  me,  w^ho  slippeth  in  sin,  placing  before  me  the  v^ays 
of  repentance,  O  thou  who  by  thy  glorious  Ascension 
didst  vouchsafe  that  the  nature  which  thou  hadst  taken 
should  sit  at  the  right  hand  of  the  Father,  thereby  en- 
nobling it,  so  prepare  me  that,  by  partaking  of  thy  holy 
mysteries,  I  may  attain  the  favour  of  the  saved.  O  thou 
who  by  the  descent  of  the  comforting  Spirit  didst  make 
thy  pure  Disciples  precious  vessels,  make  me,  too,  to 
appear  a  vessel  for  his  descent,  O  thou  who  art  about 
to  come  to  judge  the  universe  with  righteousness.  Con- 
sent, O  my  Maker  and  my  Creator,  that  I  too  may  wel- 
come thee  in  the  clouds  with  all  thy  saints,  that  I  may 
ceaselessly  glorify  thee,  praising  thee  with  thy  Father 
who  hath  no  beginning,  and  thy  good,  life-giving  and 
most  Holy  Spirit,  now  and  forever  and  unto  ages  of 
ages.    Amen. 

Prayer,  by  St.  John  Damascene 

T  STAND  before  the  gates  of  thy  temple,  O  Lord, 
and  yet  my  grievous  thoughts  forsake  me  not.  But 
thou,  O  Christ  God,  who  didst  justify  the  publican, 
hadst  mercy  on  the  Canaanitish  woman,  and  didst  open 
the  gates  of  paradise  to  the  thief  on  the  Cross,  open 
unto  me  the  heart  of  thy  most  compassionate  mercy,  and 
receive  me  coming  unto  thee  and  touching  thee,  like 
the  woman  with  the  issue  of  blood,  and  like  the  sinful 
woman;  for  one  touched  but  the  hem  of  thy  garment 
and  was  healed,  and  the  other  embracing  thy  feet, 
received  forgiveness  of  her  sins.  And  lo!  I,  most 
wretched,  dare  to  partake  of  thy  precious  Body.  O  let 
me  not  be  consumed,  but  receive  me  as  thou  receivedst 
them,  and  enlighten  my  spiritual  senses  and  destroy  all 
my  sinful  inclinations.  Hear  me  through  the  prayers 
of  thy  holy  Mother  and  of  thy  heavenly  hosts;  for  thou 
art  blessed  throughout  all  ages.    Amen.

Prayer,  by  St.  John  Chrysostom 

T  BELIEVE,  O  Lord,  and  confess  that  thou  art  ver- 
ily  Christ,  the  Son  of  the  living  God,  who  didst 
come  into  the  world  to  save  sinners,  of  whom  I  am  the 
first.  And  I  believe  that  this  is  thy  most  pure  Body 
and  this  thy  most  pure  Blood.  I  therefore  pray  thee, 
have  mercy  upon  me  and  forgive  me  my  sins,  voluntary 
or  involuntary,  in  word  and  in  deed,  committed  in 
knowledge  or  in  ignorance;  and  vouchsafe  me,  to  par- 
take of  thy  most  pure  mysteries  uncondemned,  to  the 
remission  of  sins,  and  to  life  eternal.     Amen. 

CO//  approaching  to  communicate,  say  the  following  Stichoi  of  Saint 
Simeon,  the  Neo-Theologian. 

UEHOLD,  I  approach  the  divine  Communion! 
^^  My  Creator,  consume  me  not  in  the  partaking  of  it; 

For  thou  art  a  consuming  Fire  to  the  unworthy; 

Purify  me  now  from  every  stain. 

Receive  me  today,  O  Son  of  God,  a  partaker  of  thy 
sacramental  Supper ;  for  I  shall  not  divulge  thy  mystery 
to  thine  enemies,  nor  give  thee  a  kiss  like  Judas.  But 
like  the  thief  I  shall  confess  to  thee,  Remember  me, 
L/Ord,  in  thy  kingdom. 

^And  again  these  Stichoi. 

r^   MAN,  behold  the  divine  Blood,  and  tremble; 
For  it  is  a  fire  consuming  the  unworthy. 

The  divine  Body  both  deifieth  and  nourisheth  me; 

It  deifieth  the  spirit,  and  strangely  nourisheth  the 
mind. 

^Also  the  following  Troparia. 

T^HOU  hast  enraptured  me,  O  Christ,  by  thy  long- 
ing and  hast  changed  me  by  thy  divine  love.  Con-

it  is  not  a  wedding  garment,  and  I  shall  be  bound  hand

worthiness,  but  to  the  purification  and  sanctification  of 
my  soul  and  body,  and  as  an  earnest  of  thine  everlasting 
kingdom  and  life;  for  it  is  better  for  me  to  cleave  unto

T  THANK  thee,  O  Lord  my  God,  that  thou  hast  not 
rejected  me,  a  sinner,  but  hast  permitted  me  to  be- 
come a  partaker  of  thy  Sacrament.  I  thank  thee  that 
thou,  hast  enabled  me,  unworthy,  to  receive  thy  pure 
and  heavenly  gifts.  Wherefore,  O  philanthropic  Lord, 
who  didst  die  for  us,  and  didst  rise  again,  and  hast  be- 
stowed upon  us  these  dread  and  life-giving  mysteries 
to  the  benefit  and  sanctification  of  our  souls  and  bodies; 
grant  that  they  may  operate  in  me  to  the  healing  of  my 
soul  and  body,  to  the  overthrow  of  every  evil  thing,  to 
the  enlightenment  of  my  heart,  to  the  peace  of  my  spir- 
itual faculties,  to  invincible  faith,  to  sincere  love,  to 
increase  of  wisdom,  to  the  keeping  of  thy  command- 
ments, to  growth  in  grace,  and  to  the  inheritance  of  thy 


Metalepsis  103 

kingdom;  that,  preserved  by  them  in  thy  sanctification, 
I  may  ever  call  to  mind  thy  grace,  and  live  not  unto 
myself  but  unto  thee,  my  Master  and  Benefactor.  And 
thus  when  this  life  on  earth  shall  have  passed  away  in 
the  hope  of  life  eternal,  may  I  attain  unto  everlasting 
rest  where  the  hymn  of  those  who  glorify  thee  is  un- 
ceasing, and  the  delight  of  those  who  behold  the  inef- 
fable goodness  of  thy  face  is  infinite;  for  thou  art  the 
true  desire  and  inexpressible  joy  of  those  who  love  thee, 
O  Christ  our  God,  and  all  creation  glorifieth  thee  to  all 
eternity.    Amen. 

Another  Prayer  of  Saint  Basil  the  Great 

Q  MASTER,  Christ  God,  King  of  kings,  and  Cre- 
^^^  ator  of  the  universe,  I  thank  thee  for  all  the  good 
things  thou  hast  bestowed  on  me,  but  above  all,  for 
participation  in  thy  pure  and  life-giving  mysteries.  I 
therefore  pray  thee,  good  and  philanthropic  Lord,  keep 
me  under  thy  shelter  and  in  the  shadow  of  thy  wings, 
and  grant  me,  in  a  pure  conscience,  to  my  latest  breath, 
worthily  to  partake  of  thy  holy  Sacrament,  to  the  remis- 
sion of  sins  and  to  life  eternal;  for  thou  art  the  Bread 
of  life,  the  source  of  sanctification,  the  Giver  of  all 
good ;  and  to  thee  we  ascribe  all  glory,  with  the  Father 
and  the  Holy  Spirit,  now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of

Receive  their  prayers  graciously,  O  my  Christ,  and 
render  me,  thy  worshipper,  a  son  of  light.

worthy to  be  a  partaker  of  the  most  pure  Body  and  the

Midnight  Prayers  on  Sundays  107 

Let  us  all  with  divine  songs  give  fitting  praise  to 
the  Father,  Son,  and  divine  Spirit,  the  three-personed 
Might,  the  one  Kinghood,  and  the  one  Godhead. 

When  creation  beheld  thy  Son,  O  pure  Virgin,  rising 
from  the  dead  as  befitteth  a  God,  it  was  filled  with  in- 
effable joy,  glorifying  and  honouring  him. 

CThen  say:  Holy  God,  etc.^  and  the  Hypakoe  in  the  Tone  in  use, 
and  if  it  be  a  Feast,  Day  and  not  a  Sunday,  sing  the  Litiva  instead 
of  the  Canon  of  the  Triadikon,  and  after  it,  Holy  God,  etc.  Then 
the  Troparion  of  the  Feast,  and  at  Holy  God,  the  Priest  enters  the 
Sanctuary  wearing  the  stole,  and  says.  For  thine  is  the  kingdom,  etc.; 
and  while  the  Choir  sings  the  Hypakoe  or  the  Troparion,  the  Priest 
comes  out  wearing  the  Stole,  and  standeth  in  front  of  the  Royal  Door, 
When  the  Choir  concludes,  the  Priest  immediately  saith  the  following 
Petitions. 

Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to  thy  great 
mercy,  we  beseech  thee.    Hearken,  and  have  mercy. 

C^The  Choir  at  each  Petition  chanteth  alternately.  Lord,  have  mercy, 
{three  times). 

Again,  let  us  pray  for  all  pious  and  Orthodox  Chris-

Again,  we  pray  for  our  Father  and  Bishop  (N.  )

And  again,  we  ask  mercy,  life,  safety,  sound  health, 
and  the  salvation  of  the  servants  of  God  and  ever-mem- 
orable founders  of  this  holy  house;  and  those  who 
pray  therein  {its  agents)^  and  its  benefactors,  for  their 
visitation,  and  for  their  forgiveness,  and  the  remission 
of  their  sins. 

And  again  we  ask  for  the  preservation  of  this  holy 
church,  this  city,  and  all  other  cities  and  towns,  from 
famine,  destruction,  earthquake,  flood,  fire,  and  the 
sword;  from  the  surprise  attacks  of  foreign  tribes,  from 
civil  wars,  and  sudden  death.  We  pray  that  our  good 
^nd  philanthropic  God  in  pity,  mercy,  and  compassion 
turn  away  from  us  all  desecration  that  riseth  against  us, 
deliver  us  from  his  just  threat,  and  have  mercy  upon  us.

holy,  most  pure  and  blameless  Mother,  and  of  our  right- 
eous, God-mantled  Fathers,  and  of  the  two  righteous 
holy  grandparents  of  Christ,  Joachim  and  Anne,  and  of 
all  the  saints,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save  us ;  for  thou 
art  good  and  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

^Then  he  turneth  to  the  people  and  saith: 

Forgive  me,  brethren. 

^And  the  Congregation  replies:

saith:

Tone  as  the  Troparion  of  the  Resurrection  designates,  or  the  Tro- 
parion  of  the  Feast. 

0  give  thanks  unto  the  Lord;  call  upon  his  Name. 
All  nations  compassed  me  about,  and  in  the  Name  of 

the  Lord  I  have  been  revenged  on  them. 

This  is  the  Lord's  doing.    It  is  marvelous  in  our  eyes. 

CJf,  however,  it  be  a  Sunday,  the  Troparion  of  the  Resurrection  is 
chanted  (two  times),  or  the  Troparion  of  the  Saint  in  whose  honour

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord:  teach  me  thy  statutes. 

Very  early  in  the  morning,  did  the  ointment-bearing 
women  run  lamenting  unto  thy  tomb;  but  the  angel 
came  toward  them  saying.  The  time  for  lamentation  is 
past;  weep  not,  but  announce  the  Resurrection  unto  the 
Apostles. 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord :  teach  me  thy  statutes. 

The  ointment-bearing  women  mourned  as,  bearing 
ointments,  they  drew  near  to  thy  tomb,  O  Saviour.  But 
the  angel  crying  unto  them  with  joy  said.  Why  num- 
ber ye  the  living  among  the  dead?  In  that  he  is  God, 
he  is  risen  from  the  grave.

We  worship  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy 
Spirit,  the  Holy  Trinity  in  one  Essence,  crying  with 
the  seraphim,  Holy!    Holy!    Holy!    art  thou,  O  Lord. 

Now 

In  that  thou  didst  bear  the  Giver  of  life,  O  Virgin, 
thou  didst  redeem!  Adam  from  sin,  and  didst  give  to 
Eve  joy  in  place  of  sadness;  but  he  who  was  incarnate 
of  thee,  both  God  and  Man,  hath  restored  to  life  those 
who  had  fallen  therefrom.

5.  O  Virgin  that  knew  no  wedlock,  the  whole  crea-

Because  he  that  is  mighty,  hath  done  great  things  to 
me;  and  holy  is  his  Name;  and  his  mercy  is  from 
generation  to  generation  to  them  that  fear  him. 

He  hath  shewed  strength  in  his  arm:  he  hath  scat- 
tered the  proud  in  the  conceit  of  their  heart. 

He  hath  put  down  the  mighty  from  their  seat,  and 
hath  exalted  the  humble.  He  hath  filled  the  hungry 
with  good  things,  and  the  rich  hath  he  sent  away  empty. 

He  hath  received  Israel  his  servant,  being  mindful 
of  his  mercy.  As  he  spake  to  our  Fathers,  to  Abraham, 
and  to  his  seed  forever.

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul,  and  never  forget  all  he 
hath  done  for  thee. 

Who  forgiveth  all  thy  iniquities:  who  healeth  all  thy 
disease: 

Who  redeemeth  thy  life  from  destruction:  who 
crowneth  thee  with  mercy  and  compassion: 

Who  satisfieth  thy  desire  with  good  things;  thy  youth 
shall  be  renewed  like  the  eagle's. 

The  Lord  doeth  mercies  and  judgment  for  all  that 
suffer  wrong. 


The  Divine  Liturgy  121 

He  hath  made  his  ways  known  to  Moses:  his  wills  to 
the  children  of  Israel. 

The  Lord  is  compassionate  and  merciful:  long-suf- 
fering and  plenteous  in  mercy. 

He  will  not  always  be  angry;  nor  will  he  threaten 
forever. 

He  hath  not  dealt  with  us  according  to  our  sins:  nor 
rewarded  us  according  to  our  iniquities. 

For  according  to  the  height  of  the  heaven  above  the 
earth:  he  hath  strengthened  his  mercy  towards  them 
that  fear  him. 

As  far  as  the  east  is  from  the  west,  so  far  hath  he 
removed  our  iniquities  from  us. 

As  a  father  hath  compassion  on  his  children,  so  hath 
the  Lord  compassion  on  them  that  fear  him:  for  he 
knoweth  our  frame. 

He  remembereth  that  we  are  dust:  man's  days  are  as 
grass,  as  the  flower  of  the  field  so  shall  he  flourish. 

For  the  spirit  shall  pass  in  him,  and  he  shall  not  be: 
and  he  shall  know  his  place  no  more. 

But  the  mercy  of  the  Lord  is  from  eternity  and  unto 
eternity  upon  them  that  fear  him: 

And  his  justice  unto  children's  children,  to  such  as 
keep  his  covenant. 

And  are  mindful  of  his  commandments  to  do  them. 

The  Lord  hath  prepared  his  throne  in  heaven:  and 
his  kingdom  shall  rule  over  all. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  angels;  you  that  are  mighty 
in  strength,  and  execute  his  word,  hearkening  to  the 
voice  of  his  orders. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  hosts:  you  ministers  of  his 
that  do  his  will. 

Bless  the  Lord,  all  his  works:  in  every  place  of  his 
dominion,  O  my  soul,  bless  thou  the  Lord. 

Glory  and  Now 

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul :  and  all  that  is  within  me,

in  whom  there  is  no  salvation. 

His  spirit  shall  go  forth,  and  he  shall  return  into  his 
earth;  in  that  day  all  their  thoughts  shall  perish. 

Blessed  is  he  who  hath  the  God  of  Jacob  for  his 
helper,  whose  hope  is  in  the  Lord  his  God:  who  made 
heaven  and  earth,  the  sea,  and  all  things  that  are  in 
them: 

Who  keepeth  truth  for  ever :  who  executeth  judgment 
for  them  that  suffer  wrong:  who  giveth  food  to  the 
hungry. 

The  Lord  looseth  them  that  are  fettered;  the  Lord 
enlighteneth  the  blind.

fatherless  and  the  widow:  and  the  ways  of  the  sinners 
he  will  destroy.

FIRST  TONE 

1 .    Saturday  Vespers 

The  Stichera  on  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried 

f^  HOLY  Lord,  accept  our  evening  prayers.  Grant 
^^  us  forgiveness  of  our  sins ;  for  thou  alone  art  he  who 
didst  reveal  the  Resurrection  in  the  world. 

O  ye  peoples,  encircle  Zion  and  surround  it;  give  ye 
glory  therein  to  him  who  is  risen  from  the  dead;  for  he 
is  our  God  who  has  delivered  us  from  our  sins. 

Come,  ye  peoples,  let  us  praise  Christ  and  bow  down 
to  him,  glorifying  his  Resurrection  from  the  dead;  for 
he  is  our  God  who  delivered  the  world  from  the  decep- 
tion of  the  enemy. 

Rejoice,  O  heaven,  blow  the  horn,  ye  foundations  of 
the  earth,  and  cry,  O  mountains,  with  joy;  for  behold, 
Immanuel  hath  nailed  our  sins  upon  his  Cross;  and  the 
Life-giver  hath  caused  death  to  die,  raising  Adam;  for 
he  is  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Let  us  praise  him  who  was  willingly  crucified  in  the 
flesh  for  our  sake;  who  didst  suffer,  was  buried,  and 
who  rose  from  the  dead,  saying,  O  Christ,  confirm  thy 
Church  in  sound  doctrine  anid  preserve  our  lives;  for 
thou  art  good  and  the  Lover  of  mankind. 


138  Oktoechos 

Let  us,  though  unworthy,  stand  by  thy  life-giving 
tomb,  O  Christ  our  Lord,  and  let  us  offer  glory  to  thine 
ineffable  compassion;  for  thou  didst  accept  crucifixion 
and  death,  O  sinless  One,  that  thou  mightest  grant  res- 
urrection to  the  world ;  for  thou  art  good  and  the  Lover 
of  mankind. 

Let  us  praise  the  Word  which  haid  no  beginning, 
coeternal  with  the  Father;  who  issued  from  the  virginal 
womb  in  an  inexplicable  way;  who  accepted  willingly 
crucifixion  and  death  for  our  sakes,  and  arose  in  glory, 
saying.  Glory  to  thee,  O  life-giving  Lord,  the  Saviour 
of  our  souls. 

Glory  and  Now  to  our  Lady 

T  ET  us  praise  Mary  the  Virgin,  the  glory  of  the 
'^  whole  world,  branching  from  human  seed  and 
mother  of  the  Master,  the  heavenly  gate,  the  praise  of 
the  incorporals  and  the  beauty  of  believers;  for  verily 
she  did  appear  as  a  paradise  and  tabernacle  of  Divinity. 
She  idid  tear  down  the  middle  wall  of  partition,  the 
intervening  enmity,  bringing  safety  instead  thereof; 
and  did  open  the  kingdom.  Therefore,  let  us  hold 
fast  to  her;  for  she  is  the  anchor  of  faith;  and  let 
us  accept  the  Lord,  the  child  whom  she  bore,  as  our 
helper.  Be  of  good  cheer  now,  O  people  of  God,  and 
have  faith;  for  he  shall  fight  against  our  enemies;  for 
he  is  Almighty. 

Aposicha 
r\  CHRIST,  by  thy  Passion  we  have  been  saved  from 
passion,   and  by  thy  Resurrection  we  have  been 
saved  from  corruption.     O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

Let  creation  rejoice  and  the  heavens  have  joy;  and 
let  the  nations  clap  their  hands  together  with  eladness; 
for  Christ  our  Saviour  ditd  nail  our  sins  upon  his  Cross : 
and  in  causing  death  to  die,  did  grant  us  life  and  did 
raise  the  fallen  Adam  and  all  his  descendants;  for  he  is 
the  Lover  of  mankind. 

O  inscrutable  Creator,  the  King  of  heaven  and  earth, 
thou  who  for  love  of  mankind  didst  accept  crucifixion 


First  Tone  139 

willingly;  verily,  hades  when  it  met  thee  below  did 
murmur;  and  the  souls  of  the  righteous  when  they 
received  thee  did  rejoice.  And  Adam,  when  he  saw 
thee  beneath  the  earth  did  stand  up  and  arise.  How 
wonderful  it  is  that  he  who  is  the  Life  of  all  did  taste 
death,  and  that  of  his  own  will,  for  the  lighting  of  the 
world,  which  crieth  out  saying,  O  thou  who  didst  rise 
from  the  dead,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

Yea,  the  ointment-bearing  women  carried  ointment 
and  hurried  diligently,  crying,  and  reached  thy  grave. 
And  when  they  coulid  not  find  thy  pure  body,  learning 
from  the  angel  the  great  and  new  happening,  they  did 
tell  the  Disciples  that  the  Lord  had  risen,  granting  the 
world  the  Great  Mercy. 


Glory  and  Now  to  our  Lady 

TOEHOLD  the  prophecy  of  Isaiah  hath  been  fulfilled ; 
-■^for  while  yet  a  Virgin  thou  hast  given  birth;  and 
thou  hast  remained  after  giving  birth  as  thou  wert 
before;  for  he  that  is  born  of  thee  is  God;  therefore,  he 
renewed  nature.  Turn  thou  not  away,  therefore,  O 
Theotokos,  from  the  supplications  of  thy  servants,  of- 
fered in  thy  temple.  But  since  thou  didst  carry  in  thy 
bosom  the  comp^issionate  One,  have  compassion  on 
those  who  petition  thee,  and  intercede  for  the  salvation 
of  our  souls. 

Troparion  for  the  Resurrection 

TpHE  stone  being  sealed  by  the  Jews,  and  thy  pure 
body  being  guarded  by  the  soldiers,  thou  didst  rise 
on  the  third  day,  O  Saviour,  granting  life  to  the  world. 
Wherefore,  the  heavenly  powers  acclaimed  thee,  O 
Giver  of  life,  crying,  Glory  to  thy  Resurrection,  O 
Christ!  Glory  to  thy  kingdom!  Glory  to  thy  gracious 
providence,  O  thou  only  Lover  of  mankind.

AS  Gabriel  cried  unto  thee,  O  Virgin,  Hail!  with 
^^^  that  cry  did  the  Lord  of  all  become  incarnate  in 
thee,  O  holy  ark,  as  spake  the  righteous  David;  and 
thou  wast  revealed  as  more  spacious  than  the  heavens, 
in  that  thou  bore  thy  Creator.  Wherefore,  glory  to  him 
who  abode  in  thee!  Glory  to  him  who  came  from  thee! 
Glory  to  him  who  through  thy  birth-giving  hath  set 
us  freel 

2.    Matins 

First  Kathisma 

npHE  soldiers  who  kept  watch  over  thy  grave,  O 
Saviour,  became  as  dead  from  the  shining  of  the 
appearing  angel  who  told  the  good  tidings  of  the  Resur- 
rection to  the  women.  Thee,  therefore,  do  we  glorify, 
O  Remover  of  corruption,  and  to  thee  do  we  bow,  O 
thou  who  didst  rise  from  the  grave,  O  thou,  our  only 
Lord. 

Glory:  Thou  wast  nailed  upon  the  cross  willingly, 
O  merciful  One;  and  thou  wast  placed  in  a  grave  like 
one  who  is  dead,  O  Giver  of  life,  trampling  the  pride 
of  death,  O  mighty  One;  for  because  of  thee  the  gate- 
keepers of  hades  did  tremble;  and  thou  didst  raise  the 
dead  with  thee  from  eternity;  for  thou  alone  art  the 
Lover  of  mankind. 

Now:  We  have  all  known  thee  as  Theotokos,  and 
after  giving  birth  thou  didst  appear  truly  virgin.  We 
who  eagerly  seek  refuge  in  thy  goodness,  have  thus 
known  thee;  for  we  sinners  have  taken  thee  as  inter- 
cessor, and  in  temptations  have  possessed  thee  as  our 
salvation,  O  thou  who  alone  art  blameless. 

Second  Kathisma 

^X/'ERILY  did  the  women  proceed  to  the  grave  early, 
where  they  beheld  an  angelic  scene,  and  did  trem- 
ble.    And  when  the  grave  shone  forth  with  life  they 


First  Tone  141 

were  struck  with  astonishment.  Wherefore,  they  re- 
turned to  the  Disciples  and  did  preach  the  Resurrec- 
tion, saying,  Verily  Christ  hath  invaded  hades;  for  he 
alone  is  the  powerful  and  mighty  One;  and  he  raised 
with  him  all  those  who  were  corrupt,  and  with  the 
power  of  his  Cross  he  removed  the  fear  of  condemna- 
tion. 

Glory:  Thou  wast  verily  nailed  upon  the  Cross,  O 
Life  of  all;  and  wast  numbered  among  the  dead,  O 
deathless  Lord.  Thou  didst  rise  after  three  days,  O 
Saviour,  and  didst  raise  Adam  from  corruption. 
Wherefore,  the  heavenly  Powers  shouted  to  thee,  O 
Giver  of  life;  Glory  to  thy  Passion,  O  Christ,  glory  to 
thy  Resurrection,  glory  to  thy  condescension,  O  thou 
alone  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Now:  O  Mary,  the  reverend  abode  of  the  Lord,  lift 
us,  who  have  fallen  in  the  abyss  of  evil  despair,  tres- 
passes, and  sorrows;  for  thou  didst  give  salvation  to 
sinners.  Thou  art  a  helper  and  a  strong  intercessor, 
and  dost  save  thy  servants. 

Hypakoe 
npHE  repentance  of  the  thief  gained  him  paradise  by 
^  stealth,  and  the  sighing  of  the  ointment-bearing 
women  proclaimed  the  glad  tidings  that  thou  wast  risen, 
O  Christ,  and  hadst  bestowed  upon  the  world  thy  Great 
Mercy. 

Anabathmoi  —  First  Antiphony 
O  Lord,  to  thee  in  my  sorrows  do  I  cry.    Hear  thou 
my  cry  of  pain. 

Verily,  the  divine  desire  shall  be  without  delay  upon 
the  people  of  the  wilderness;  for  that  they  have  come 
out  of  the  vain  world. 

Glory  and  Now 
T/'ERILY,  glory  and  honour  become  the  Holy  Spirit, 
as  they  become  the  Father  and  the  Son.    Where- 
fore, do  we  praise  the  Triune,  One  in  might.

r\  GOD,  since  thou  hast  raised  me  to  the  hills  of  thy 
^^  laws,  shed  brightly  thy  light  of  virtue  upon  me, 
that  I  may  praise  thee. 

O  Word,  hold  me  fast  with  thy  right  hand;  keep  me 
and  preserve  me,  lest  the  fire  of  sin  consume  me. 

Glory  and  Now 

^ERILY,  all  creation  together  is  regenerated  by  the 
Holy  Spirit,  and  returns  to  its  former  being:  for  he 
is  coomnipotent  with  the  Father  and  the  Word. 

Third  Antiphony 

IX/TY  soul  did  rejoice  with  those  who  say,  Let  us  go 
^  ^  into  the  courts  of  the  Lord.  My  heart  was  ex-

Great  fear  shall  be  in  the  house  of  David,  where  the 
seats  shall  be  set,  and  all  tribes  and  tongues  of  the  earth 
shall  be  judged. 

Glory  and  Now 

^\/'ERILY,  it  is  meet  to  ofifer  glory,  might  and  power 
'  to  the  Holy  Spirit  as  to  the  Father  and  to  the  Son; 

for  the  Trinity  is  one  in  substance,  not  in  Person. 
Prokeimenon:    Now  will  I  arise,  saith  the  Lord. 
Stichos:   The  words  of  the  Lord  are  pure  words. 

Stichera  of  the  Einos 

^  CHRIST,  thy  saving  Passion  do  we  praise;  and 
thy  Resurrection  do  we  glorify. 

O  thou  who  didst  submit  to  the  Cross  and  didst 
abolish  death,  who  didst  arise  from  the  dead,  preserve 
our  lives,  O  Lord,  since  thou  alone  art  almighty. 

O  Christ,  who  as  a  Destroyer  didst  invade  hades,  and 
who   didst   raise   man   by   thy   Resurrection    make   us 


First  Tone  143 

worthy  to  praise  thee  with  pure  hearts,  and  to  glorify 
thee. 

O  Christ,  we  praise  thee,  glorifying  thy  condescen- 
sion, which  becometh  God.  O  thou  who  wast  born  of 
a  Virgin  and  wast  yet  inseparable  from  the  bosom 
of  the  Father;  who  didst  suffer  like  man,  didst  submit 
to  the  Cross  willingly,  didst  arise  from  the  tomb  as 
from  a  chamber,  that  thou  mightest  save  ttie  world, 
glory  to  thee,  O  Lord. 

When  thou  wast  nailed  upon  the  tree  of  the  Cross, 
then  was  the  power  of  the  enemy  put  to  death ;  then  did 
creation  tremble  in  fear  of  thee,  by  thy  might  hades  was 
invaded,  thou  didst  raise  the  dead  from  their  graves, 
and  thou  didst  open  the  gate  of  paradise  to  the  thief. 
O  Christ,  our  God,  glory  be  to  thee. 

The  honoured  women  did  come  hastening  to  the 
grave,  with  caution  and  wailing.  And  when  they  found 
the  grave  open  and  knew  from  the  angels  the  story  of 
the  new  and  wonderful  miracle,  they  did  bring  the  good 
tidines  to  the  Disciples  that  the  Lord  had  risen,  grant- 
ing the  world  Great  Mercy. 

O  Christ  God,  we  do  bow  to  the  wound  of  thy  divine 
Passion  and  to  the  lordly  service  which  was  fulfilled  in 
Zion,  coming  at  the  end  of  times  in  thy  divine  Epiph- 
any; for  thou,  O  Sun  of  justice,  didst  shine  on  those 
who  were  sitting  in  darkness;  thou  didst  lead  them  to 
the  light  which  is  never  overtaken  by  eventide.  O 
Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

O  Jewish  race,  which  loveth  trouble,  understand  and 
comprehend.  Where  are  they  who  went  in  unto  Pilate? 
Let  your  guardian  soldiers  tell  where  the  seals  of  the 
tomb  are.  Whither  was  the  buried  One  moved  from 
the  grave?  Whither  was  the  priceless  One  sold?  How 
was  the  Treasure  stolen?  Why  do  you  deny  the  Resur- 
rection of  the  Crucified,  O  wavering  people,  thus  fall- 
ing into  error,  O  Jews  who  transgress  the  law?  He  hath 
verily  risen,  standing  up,  free  among  the  dead,  and  hath 
granted  great  mercy  to  the  world.

The  Beatitudes 

^ERILY  the  enemy  did  expel  Adam  from  paradise 
^  because  he  ate  of  the  fruit.  But  Christ,  by  his 
Cross,  admitted  the  thief  in  his  place,  when  the  latter 
cried,  Remember  me,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest  into 
thy  kingdom. 

I  do  bow  down  to  thy  Passion;  I  glorify  thy  Resur- 
rection; and,  with  Adam  and  the  thief,  cry  with  plain- 
tive voice.  Remember  me,  O  Lord,  when  thou  comest 
into  thy  kingdom. 

Thou  wast  crucified,  O  sinless  One,  and  willingly 
wast  placed  in  a  grave.  But  because  thou  art  God,  thou 
didst  arise  and  with  thee  didst  raise  Adam,  who  cried, 
Remember  me  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

O  Christ  God,  thou  didst  raise  thy  body  on  the  third 
day  after  thy  burial;  and  thou  didst  raise  Adam  and 
those  who  came  from  Adam,  who  cried.  Remember  us 
when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

The  ointment-bearers  came  in  the  early  dawn  to  thy 
grave,  O  Christ  God,  wailing.  And  they  found  an 
angel  sitting,  attired  in  a  white  robe,  who  said  to  them. 
What  seek  ye?  Verily,  Christ  hath  risen.  Wail  ye 
therefore  no  more. 

O  Lord  Saviour,  thy  Disciples  went  to  the  mount  to 
which  thou  didst  command  them  to  go.  And  when 
they  had  knelt  down,  thou  didst  send  them  to  the  Gen- 
tiles to  teach  and  to  baptize  them. 

Glory:  Let  us  worship  the  Father,  let  us  glorify  the 
Son,  and  let  us  all  praise  the  all-holy  Spirit,  speaking 
out  and  saying,  O  Holy  Trinity,  save  us  all. 

Now:  O  Christ,  thy  people  doth  offer  supplication 
to  thee  and  to  thy  Mother.  By  her  pleadings,  O  good 
One,  grant  us  thy  compassion,  that  we  may  glorify  thee, 
O  thou  who  didst  shine  forth  on  us  from  the  tomb.

The  Stichera  on  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried 

/^^OME  ye,  let  us  worship  him  who  was  born  of  the 
^^  Father  before  all  time,  the  Word  of  God,  incar- 
nate of  the  Virgin  Mary;  for  he  did  submit  to  cruci- 
fixion by  his  own  choice,  was  delivered  to  burial  as  he 
himself  willed,  rose  from  the  dead,  and  saved  me,  who 
was  lost. 

Verily,  Christ  our  Saviour  nailed  to  his  Cross  the 
handwriting  of  the  decree,  and  did  expunge  it.  And  he 
abolished  the  might  of  death.  Let  us  therefore  adore 
his  third-day  Resurrection. 

Come,  let  us  with  the  archangels  praise  the  Resurrec- 
tion of  Christ;  for  he  is  the  Redeemer  and  Saviour  of 
our  souls,  and  he  it  is  who  will  come  with  fearful  mag- 
nificence and  glorious  might  to  judge  the  world  which 
he  hath  created. 

O  thou  who  wast  crucified  and  wast  buried,  the  angel 
did  proclaim  thee,  that  thou  art  the  Master,  saying  to 
the  women.  Come  ye  and  behold  where  the  Lord  was 
laid;  for  he  is  risen  as  he  said;  for  he  is  the  Almighty 
One,  and  therefore,  do  we  worship  thee,  O  thou  who 
alone  art  deathless;  O  Christ,  Giver  of  life,  have  mercy 
upon  us. 

With  thy  Cross  thou  didst  abolish  the  curse  of  the 
tree;  with  thy  Death  and  Burial  thou  didst  cause  the 
might  of  death  to  die;  and  with  thy  Resurrection  thou 
didst  enlighten  mankind.  Wherefore,  do  we  cry  to 
thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  the  Benefactor,  glory  to  thee. 

O  Lord,  verily,  the  gates  of  death  were  opened  to  thee 
for  fear  of  thee.  And  as  the  gate-keepers  of  hades  saw 
thee  they  did  tremble;  for  thou  didst  break  asunder  its 
brazen  gates;  didst  crush  its  iron  bars;  didst  bring  us 
out  from  the  shadow  and  darkness  of  death;  and  didst 
break  our  bonds  asunder.

Come,  let  us  all  sing  with  our  mouths  a  song  of  sal- 
vation. Let  us  kneel  down  in  the  house  of  the  Lord, 
saying,  O  thou  who  wast  crucified  on  a  Tree,  who  didst 
rise  from  the  dead,  and  who  still  remainest  in  the  bosom 
of  the  Father,  forgive  us  our  sins. 

Glory  and  Now  to  our  Lady 

f~\  VIRGIN,  verily,  the  shadow  of  the  law  hath  been 
^-^  annulled  by  the  coming  of  thy  grace;  for  as  the 
bush  was  burning  but  not  consumed,  so  didst  thou  give 
birth  while  yet  a  Virgin.  And  instead  of  the  pillar  of 
fire,  the  Sun  of  justice  shone  forth;  and  instead  of 
Moses,  Christ  the  Saviour  of  our  souls.

Aposticha 

HY  Resurrection,  O  Christ  Saviour,  hath  illumined 
the  whole  universe.  Thou  hast  renewed  thy  crea- 
tion, O  Lord  Almighty.     Glory  to  thee. 

By  the  Tree,  O  Saviour,  thou  hast  removed  the  curse 
that  was  caused  by  a  tree;  and  by  thy  Burial  thou  hast 
caused  the  might  of  death  to  die.  Thou  hast  illumined 
our  race  by  thy  Resurrection.  Wherefore,  do  we  shout 
to  thee,  O  Christ  our  Lord,  Giver  of  life,  glory  to  thee. 

O  Christ,  when  thou  wast  seen  nailed  upon  the  Cross, 
thou  didst  invert  the  beauty  of  creation.  Yet  withal  did 
the  soldiers  show  brutality  when  they  pierced  thy  side 
with  a  spear.  And  the  Hebrews  comprehended  not  the 
might  of  thine  authority,  seeking  to  seal  thy  tomb.  But 
thou  who  for  the  compassion  of  thy  mercies  didst  accept 
a  tomb,  and  didst  rise  in  three  days,  O  Lord,  glory  to 
thee. 

O  Christ  God,  O  Giver  of  life,  thou  didst  bear  the 
Passion  willingly  for  the  sake  of  the  dead.  Thou  didst 
descend  into  hndes.  for  thou  art  mighty,  and  didst 
snatch  away  from  the  hand  of  the  proud  one  those  who 
there  awaited  thv  coming,  bestowing  paradise  upon 
them  for  an  abode  instead  of  hades.     Wherefore,  we

him  who  containeth  all  creation?  Yet  this  is  the  will  of 
the  born  God.  Cease  not,  therefore,  O  undefiled  one 
to  pray  to  him  whom  thou  didst  carry  in  thine  arms  as  a 
babe,  and  with  whom  thou  didst  acquire  motherly  priv- 
ilege for  us  who  honour  thee,  that  he  may  have  mercy 
upon  us  and  save  our  souls.

foreign  to  corruption.  Rather  cry  ye  instead,  The  Lord

Now:  O  virgin  Theotokos,  exceeding  glorified,  we 
praise  thee;  for  by  the  Cross  of  thy  Son  hades  hath  been 
demolished  and  death  hath  been  put  to  death.  And 
we  did  rise,  after  we  were  dead;  and  became  worthy  of 
life;  and  obtained  the  paradise  of  ancient  bliss.  Where-

put  to  death;  and  we  were  made  to  live  again.  Where-

O  transgressors  of  the  law,  when  ye  did  seal  the

him  away;  for  who  would  steal  a  corpse,  especially  a

thou  didst  raise  us  from  suffering  by  thy  Resurrection, 
and  didst  abolish  all  the  might  of  death.  Wherefore, 
we  shout  to  thee  in  faith.  Remember  us  also  in  thy  king- 
dom. 

By  thy  three-day  Burial,  thou  hast  revived  the  dead 
who  are  in  hades,  and  hast  raised  them  with  thee,  since 
thou  art  God.  And  since  thou  art  good,  thou  didst  cause 
incorruption  to  spring  up  for  us  who  ever  cry  to  thee 
in  faith.  Remember  us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

Thou  didst  appear  first  to  the  ointment-bearing 
women,  O  Christ  Saviour,  when  thou  didst  rise  from 
the  dead,  and  shouted  to  them.  Rejoice;  and  through 
them  thou  didst  proclaim  thy  Resurrection  to  thy  be- 
loved ones.  And  therefore  we  shout  to  thee  in  faith. 
Remember  us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

Verily,  Moses,  when  he  stretched  out  his  hands  on 
the  mountain,  conquering  Amalek,  foreshadowed  the 
Cross.  As  for  us,  having  taken  him  in  faith  as  a  power- 
ful Weapon  against  demons,  we  shout  together.  Re- 
member us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

Glory:  Let  us,  O  believers,  praise  the  Father,  the 
Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  one  God  and  one  Lord,  as 
from  one  sun;  for  the  Trinity  is  verily  like  the  trinity 
of  light,  and  lighteth  all  those  who  cry  to  him,  Remem- 
ber us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

Now:  Rejoice,  O  gate  of  God,  through  whom  the 
Creator  did  pass  incarnate,  preserving  thee  sealed.  Re- 
joice, O  bright  cloud  bearing  Christ  who  is  the  divine 
Rain.  Rejoice,  O  heavenly  ladder  and  throne.  Rejoice, 
O  revered  and  fat  mountain,  never  ending.

E  worship   untiringly  thy  quickening   Cross,   O 


W 


Christ  God,  and  glorify  thy  third-day  Resurrec- 
tion; for  by  it,  O  Almighty,  thou  hast  renewed  the  cor- 
rupt nature  of  mankind,  and  made  plain  to  us  the  as- 
cent to  heaven;  for  thou  alone  art  good  and  the  Lover 
of  mankind. 

When  thou  wast  willingly  nailed  upon  the  Cross,  O 
Saviour,  thou  solvedest  the  problem  caused  by  the  tree 
of  sin.  And  when  thou  didst  descend  into  hades,  thou 
didst  break  the  bonds  of  death,  since  thou  art  a  mighty 
God.  Wherefore,  we  worship  thy  Resurrection  from 
the  dead,  shouting  with  joy,  O  Almighty  Lord,  glory 
to  thee. 

Thou  didst  demolish  by  thy  Death,  O  Lord,  the  gates 
of  hades;  thou  didst  dissolve  the  realm  of  death;  and 
didst  free  the  human  race  from  corruption,  granting 
the  world  life  and  incorruptibility  and  Great  Mercy. 

Come,  ye  nations,  let  us  praise  the  third-day  Resur- 
rection of  the  Saviour,  by  which  we  were  delivered 
from  the  unbreakable  bonds  of  hades,  and  by  which  we 
have  all  received  life  and  incorruption,  crying,  O  thou 
who  wast  crucified,  buried,  and  who  didst  rise,  save  us 
by  thy  Resurrection,  O  thou  only  Lover  of  mankind. 

Verily,  the  angels  and  men,  O  Saviour,  praise  thy 
third-day  Ressurrection,  through  which  the  ends  of  the 
universe  have  been  lighted,  and  by  which  thou  hast  re- 
deemed from  bondage  to  the  enemy  us  who  cry,  saying, 
O  omnipotent  Giver  of  life,  save  us  by  thy  Resurrec- 
tion, O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Thou  hast  demolished  the  brazen  gates,  O  Christ 
God,  and  hast  shattered  the  bars,  and  hast  raised  the 
fallen  human  race  and  made  it  to  stand  upright.  Where- 
fore, do  we  shout  to  thee  in  unison,  O  thou  rising  from 
the  dead,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee.

Thy  birth  from  the  Father,  O  Lord,  is  eternal  and

is  awe-inspiring  to  Satan  and  his  angels;  for  thou  didst 
trample  down  death  and  didst  rise  the  third  day,  grant-

right;  for  God  hath  shown  thee  to  be  a  Mother  bring-

his  likeness,  corrupt  with  suffering,  in  order  to  find  the 
sheep  lost  in  the  hills,  and  carry  it  on  his  shoulders, 
and  ofifer  it  to  the  Father,  and  add  it,  through  his  will,

TI7HEN  thou  wast  lifted  up  upon  the  Cross,  O  Lord, 
thou  didst  expunge  our  ancestral  curse;  and  when 
thou  didst  descend  to  hades,  thou  didst  free  those  who 
were  bound  from  eternity,  granting  the  human  race  in- 
corruptibility. Wherefore,  we  offer  praise,  glorifying 
thy  third-day  Resurrection. 

O  thou  who  alone  art  mighty,  when  thou  wast  fas- 
tened upon  a  Tree,  thou  didst  shake  the  whole  earth; 
and  when  thou  wast  laid  in  the  grave,  thou  didst  raise 
those  who  lay  in  the  graves,  granting  mankind  life  and 
incorruptibility.  Wherefore,  we  offer  praise,  glorify- 
ing thy  third-day  Resurrection. 

The  law-transgressing  people,  O  Christ,  delivered 
thee  to  Pilate,  who  condemned  thee  to  crucifixion.  Thus 
the  ingrate  appeared  before  his  Benefactor.     But  thou

suffcredst  burial  willingly,  and  didst  rise  on  the  third 
day  by  thine  own  power;  for  thou  art  God,  granting  us 
endless  and  Great  Mercy. 

Verily,  the  women  reached  thy  tomb  seeking  thee 
with  tears.  And  when  they  found  thee  not,  they  shouted 
and  wailed,  saying,  Woe  to  us,  O  our  Saviour,  King  of 
all,  how  wast  thou  stolen?  And  what  place  containeth 
thy  life-bearing  body?  And  an  angel  answered  them, 
saying.  Weep  not,  but  go  preach  that  the  Lord  hath 
risen,  granting  us  joy;  for  he  alone  is  compassionate.

bear  the  brilliance  of  the  angel,  they  trembled  in  as-

paradise  to  the  thief?  Or  is  he  risen  up  who  before 
his  Passion  did  preach  resurrection?  Verily,  Christ 
God  hath  risen,  granting  resurrection  and  life  to  those 
who  are  in  hades. 

Glory:  Thou  hast  suffered  crucifixion  willingly,  O 
Saviour,  ands  mortal  men  placed  in  a  new  tomb  thee 
who  didst  stablish  the  corners  of  the  world  with  a  word. 
Therefore,  hath  death  the  stranger  been  bound  and 
taken  captive,  being  defeated.  And  all  those  in  hades, 
cried  out  through  thy  reviving  Resurrection,  Verily, 
Christ  the  Life-giver  is  risen;  for  he  is  everlastingly 
constant. 

Now:  Thy  betrothed  and  guardian,  O  Theotokos, 
when  he  beheld  thy  supernatural  Conception  without 
seed,  was  amazed  and  perplexed.  But  he  recalled  to 
his  mind  the  rain  falling  on  the  fleece  of  wool,  and  the 
bush  burning  with  fire  but  not  cosnumed,  and  he  tes- 
tified before  the  priests,  crying,  A  Virgin  giving  birth, 
and  after  remaining  virgin.

crush  the  might  of  death,  proclaiming  resurrection  to 
all.  Wherefore,  do  we  glorify  thee,  O  thou  who  alone 
art  merciful  and  the  Lover  of  mankind.

didst  rise  from  the  dead. 

Thou  hast  freed  us,  O  Christ,  from  the  first  curse. 
And  by  thy  Death  thou  didst  banish  the  insurgency  of 
Diabolus  prevailing  over  our  nature.  And  in  thy  Res- 
urrection thou  didst  fill  all  with  joy.  Wherefore,  we 
cry  to  thee,  O  thou  Lord,  who  didst  rise  from  the  dead; 
glory  to  thee. 

O  Christ  Saviour,  who  didst  rise  from  the  dead,  lead

gins  of  the  enemy.     Stretch  forth  thine  arm  and  raise 


1 66  Oktoechos 

us  who  are  fallen  in  sins;  through  the  intercession  of 
thy  saints,  O  Lord,  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

O  only  Son  of  God,  thou  didst  come  to  earth,  but 
wast  not  separated  from  the  Paternal  bosom;  and  be- 
cause of  thy  love  to  mankind  thou  didst  become  un- 
changeable man.  Thou  didst  suffer  crucifixion  and 
death  in  the  flesh,  O  thou  who  in  thy  Divinity  sufifereth 
not.  Thou  didst  rise  from  the  dead,  granting  mankind 
immortality;  for  thou  alone  art  Almighty. 

Thou  didst  purchase  for  us  deathlessness,  O  Saviour, 
when  thou  didst  accept  death  bodily.  Thou  didst  dwell 
in  a  grave  to  deliver  us  from  hades,  raising  us  with  thee; 
for  as  man  thou  didst  sufifer,  but  since  thou  art  God  thou 
didst  arise.  Therefore,  do  we  shout,  Glory  to  thee,  O 
Lord,  Giver  of  life,  who  art  alone  the  Lover  of  man- 
kind. 

When  thy  Cross,  O  Saviour,  was  planted  in  Golgotha, 
the  rocks  were  split  asunder ;  and  when  thou  wast  placed 
in  a  grave  like  the  dead,  the  gate-keepers  of  hades  were 
afraid;  for  thou  didst  abolish  the  might  of  death,  and 
in  thy  Resurrection  thou  didst  bestow  incorruptibility 
on  all  the  dead.  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  Giver  of  life, 
glory  to  thee. 

The  women,  O  Christ  God,  desired  to  behold  thy 
Resurrection.  And  Mary  Magdalene  went  ahead  of 
them,  and  she  found  the  stone  rolled  from  the  grave, 
and  she  saw  the  angel  sitting  thereon,  who  said,  Why 
seek  ye  the  living  among  the  dead?  Verily,  he  hath 
risen  to  save  all  creation;  for  he  is  God. 

Say,  O  Jews,  where  is  Jesus  whom  ye  thought  ye  were 
guarding?  Where  is  he  whom  ye  had  thrown  into  the 
grave,  and  sealed  thereto  the  stone?  Give  us  the  dead 
One,  O  deniers  of  life.  Give  us  the  buried  One,  or 
else  believe  in  the  risen  One.  And  if  ye  keep  silent 
about  the  Resurrection,  the  stone  shall  proclaim  it,  even 
that  stone  which  was  rolled  away  from  the  door  of  the 
tomb.  Albeit  great  is  thy  mercy,  and  great  is  the  mys- 
tery of  thy  dispensation,  O  Saviour;  glory  to  thee.

T7ERILY,  Adam,  because  of  a  tree,  became  estranged 
from  paradise.  But  the  thief  because  of  the  tree 
of  the  Cross  came  toi  reside  in  paradise.  The  former, 
when  he  tasted  of  the  fruit,  disobeyed  the  command- 
ment of  the  Creator;  and  the  latter,  when  he  was  cruci- 
fied with  thee,  confessed  that  thou  art  a  God  disguised, 
and  cried.  Remember  me  in  thy  kingdom. 

O  thou  who  didst  ascend  the  Cross,  and  didst  annul 
the  power  of  death,  and  because  thou  art  God  didst  ex- 
punge the  handwriting  of  the  decree  against  us,  give 
us,  O  Lord,  the  repentance  of  the  thief,  O  thou  who 
art  alone  the  Lover  of  mankind.  We  who  do  worship 
thee  in  faith,  cry  to  thee,  O  Christ  our  God,  remember 
us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

By  the  spear  of  the  Cross,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  tear  in 
pieces  the  handwriting  of  the  decree  against  us,  and 
when  thou  wast  numbered  amongst  the  dead,  thou  didst 
bind  the  giant  there,  freeing  U9  all  from  the  bonds  of 
hades  by  thy  Resurrection,  by  which  we  are  illumi- 
nated, who  cry  to  thee,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  remember 
us  also  in  thy  kingdom. 

O  thou  who  wast  crucified  and  didst  rise  from  the  tomb 
after  three  days,  since  thou  art  mighty,  and  didst  raise 
with  thee  Adam  of  the  first  creation,  O  Lord,  who  alone 
art  deathless,  make  me  worthy  to  return  with  all  my 
heart  to  repentance,  and  to  cry  unto  thee  always  with 
fervid  faith,  Remember  me,  O  Saviour,  in  thy  kingdom. 

He  who  is  free  from  sufferings  became  a  suffering 
man  for  our  sakes;  and  when  he  was  nailed  upon  the 
Cross  willingly,  he  did  raise  us  with  him.  Wherefore, 
with  the  Cross  do  we  glorify  his  Passion  and  his  Resur- 
rection, through  which  he  hath  renewed  our  creation, 
and  by  which  we  are  saved,  crying.  Remember  us  also 
in  thy  kingdom.

Let  us  pray,  O  believers,  to  him  who  is  risen  from

Rejoice,  in  that  he  can  deliver  our  souls  from  corrup-

thee  for  intercession  thy  Mother,  truly  virgin,  who  gave 
thee  birth  in  the  flesh  without  seed,  and  remained  after 
birth-giving  without  corruption.  Grant,  therefore,  for-

O  Light  that  is  not  apprehended  by  eventide,  we

therein,  revealing  to  the  nations  the  light  of  the  Resur-

Let  us  praise  with  words  of  glorification  Christ,  the 
Element  of  our  salvation;  for  by  his  rising  from  the 
dead  he  hath  saved  the  world  from  falsehood,  and  the 
ranks  of  angels  rejoiced;  and  the  falsehood  of  demons 
hath  vanished ;  and  Adam  rose  up  from  the  fall ;  and  the 
authority  of  Diabolus  was  repudiated. 

When  the  guardian  soldiers  were  appointed  by  the 
transgressors  of  the  law,  they  were  instructed  by  them 
to  conceal  the  Resurrection  of  Christ;  for  they  said  to

nPHE  grave,  O  Lord,  having  been  sealed  by  the 
transgressors  of  the  law,  thou  didst  emerge  from 
within  like  as  thou  wast  born  of  the  Theotokos;  for  the 
incorporeal  angels  did  not  know  how  thou  wert  incar- 
nate. Likewise  the  guardian  soldiers  were  not  aware 
when  thou  didst  rise;  for  these  two  matters  were  con- 
cealed from  all  seekers.  But  the  wonders  appeared  to 
those  who  worshipped  the  mystery  in  faith.  Therefore, 
grant  us  who  ofifer  praise  joy  and  Great  Mercy. 

O  Lord,  thou  hast  demolished  the  everlasting  gates 
and  broken  asunder  the  chains.  Thou  didst  rise  from 
the  tomb,  leaving  behind  thy  wrappings  and  ointments 
in  the  grave,  in  testimony  of  thy  true  three-day  Burial, 
and  didst  go  before  into  Galilee,  O  thou  who  wert  kept 
in  a  cave.  Great,  therefore,  are  thy  mercies,  O  inef-

The  women  did  hasten  to  thy  tomb  to  behold  thee,  O 
Lord,  who  didst  suffer  for  us.  And  when  they  arrived, 
advancing,  they  saw  an  angel  sitting  on  the  stone  rolled 
back  from  fear.  And  he  shouted  to  them,  saying.  The 
Lord  hath  risen.  Go  and  tell  the  Disciples  that  the 
Saviour  of  our  souls  is  risen  from  the  dead. 

O  Lord  Saviour,  thou  didst  enter  unto  thy  Disciples, 
the  doors  being  closed,  as  thou  didst  come  out  of  the 
sealed  tomb,  showing  the  sufferings  of  the  flesh  which 
thou  didst  accept  in  long-sufifering;  for  thou  didst  sub- 
mit to  pains  patiently  since  thou  art  the  seed  of  David. 
But  since  thou  art  the  Son  of  God,  thou  didst  liberate 
the  world.  Great  therefore,  are  thy  mercies,  O  incom-

side thee  we  know  no  other. 

O  Lord  God,  who  shall  tell  and  who  shall  proclaim

by  thy  Resurrection  thou  hast  enriched  all  creation. 
Therefore,  O  compassionate  One,  glory  to  thee. 

Verily,  the  ointment-bearing  women  reached  thy 
tomb  very  early  seeking  to  anoint  thee,  O  deathless 
Word.  And  when  they  were  instructed  by  the  words 
of  the  angel,  they  turned  back  with  joy  to  tell  the  Apos- 
tles plainly  that  thou  hadst  risen,  O  Life  of  all,  and 
hadst  given  the  world  forgiveness  and  Great  Mercy. 

The  guards  keeping  watch  over  the  God-bearing 
tomb  said  to  the  Jews,  Woe  to  your  vain  counsel ;  for  ye 
sought  to  keep  the  Boundless.  Vainly  have  ye  laboured; 
for  ye  thought  that  ye  could  hide  the  Resurrection  of 
the  Crucified,  but  ye  only  showed  it  in  clearer  manifes- 
tation. Woe  to  your  council  of  false  opinion!  Why 
take  ye  counsel  to  hide  what  cannot  be  hidden?  Better

which  happened,  which  is,  that  an  angel,  resplendent 
like  lightning,  descended  from  heaven  and  rolled  away 
the  stone,  and  from  fear  of  him  we  were  encompassed 
by  death.  And  to  the  ointment-bearing  steadfast  women 
he  shouted  saying.  See  ye  not  the  death  of  the  guards, 
the  unsealing  of  the  tomb,  and  the  emptiness  of  hades? 
Why  seek  ye  then  as  dead,  him  who  abolished  the  vic- 
tory of  hades  and  crushed  the  thorn  of  death?  Go  ye 
in  haste  and  tell  the  glad  tidings  of  the  Resurrection  to 
the  Apostles,  and  shout  ye  fearlessly,  saying.  In  truth,

Resurrection,  O  deathless  Lord;  for  thou  didst  descend

O  Christ  our  God,  and  didst  light  those  who  are  in

remember  me  in  thy  kingdom.

The  Lord  arose  from  the  dead  on  the  third  day;  and 
he  granted  his  peace  to  his  Disciples,  and  blessed  them,

The  Stichera  on  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried 

t^VENING  praise  and  spoken  worship  do  we  offer 
^^  thee,  O  Christ;  for  thou  didst  consent  to  have  mercy 
upon  us  by  thy  Resurrection. 

O  Lord,  O  Lord,  cast  us  not  from  before  thy  face, 
but  consent  to  have  mercy  upon  us  by  thy  Resurrection. 

Rejoice,  O  holy  Zion,  mother  of  the  churches,  the 
abode  of  God;  for  thou  didst  first  receive  forgiveness 
of  sins  by  his  Resurrection. 

Verily,  the  Word,  born  of  the  Father  before  the  ages, 
hath  himself  been  incarnate  in  the  last  times  by  his  own 
will,  of  one  who  knowest  not  wedlock.  He  did  sufifer 
crucifixion  and  death;  and  by  his  Resurrection  he  hath 
saved  man  dead  of  old. 

Let  us  glorify  thy  Resurrection  from  the  dead,  O 
Christ,  by  which  thou  didst  free  the  race  of  Adam  from 
the  usurpation  of  hades.  And  since  thou  art  God,  thou 
hast  granted  the  world  eternal  life  and  the  Great 
Mercy. 

Glory  to  thee,  O  Christ  Saviour,  only  Son  of  God, 
who  wast  nailed  upon  the  Cross,  and  who  didst  rise 
from  the  tomb  on  the  third  day. 

Thee  do  we  glorify,  O  Lord,  O  thou  who,  for  our 
sakes,  didst  suffer  crucifixion  willingly;  and  thee  do  we 
worship,  O  almighty  Saviour.  Cast  us  not,  therefore, 
from  before  thy  face,  but  give  ear  to  us  and  save  us  by 
thy  Resurrection,  O  Lover  of  mankind.

^X/'ERILY,  the  King  of  heaven,  for  his  love  to  man- 
kind, did  appear  on  earth;  and  with  men  did  he 
deal;  for  he  took  unto  himself  a  body  from  the  pure 
Virgin.  And  from  her  did  he  issue  in  the  adopted  body, 
he  being  one  Son,  dual  in  Nature,  not  dual  in  Person. 
Wherefore,  do  we  confess,  preaching  the  truth  that 
Christ  our  God  is  perfect  God  and  perfect  Man.  There- 
fore, O  Mother  who  hast  no  groom,  beseech  thou  him 
to  have  mercy  upon  our  souls. 


Aposticha 

npHOU  didst  ascend  the  Cross,  O  Jesus,  who  didst 
descend  from  heaven.  Thou  didst  come  to  death, 
O  Life  that  dieth  not,  and  to  those  who  are  in  darkness, 
O  true  Light,  and  to  the  fallen,  O  Resurrection  of  all. 
Wherefore,  O  our  Light  and  Saviour,  glory  to  thee. 

Let  us  glorify  Christ  risen  from  the  dead;  for  he  did 
take  unto  himself  a  soul  and  a  body;  and  he  separated 
one  from  the  other  in  the  Passion,  ,when  his  pure  soul 
went  down  to  hades  which  he  led  captive;  and  the  holy 
body  saw  no  corruption  in  the  grave,  the  body  of  the 
Redeemer,  Saviour  of  our  souls. 

With  psalms  and  with  songs  of  praise,  O  Christ,  do 
we  glorify  thy  Resurrection  from  the  dead,  by  which 
thou  didst  deliver  us  from  the  rebellion  of  hades.  And 
since  thou  art  God,  thou  didst  grant  us  eternal  life  and 
the  Great  Mercy. 

O  Lord  of  all,  O  incomprehensible  One;  O  Maker 
of  heaven  and  earth,  when  thou  didst  suffer  in  thy  Pas- 
sion on  the  Cross,  thou  didst  pour  out  for  me  passion- 
lessness;  and  when  thou  didst  submit  to  burial  and  didst 
rise  in  glory,  thou  didst  raise  Adam  with  thee  by  a 
mighty  hand.  Wherefore,  glory  to  thy  third-day  Resur- 
rection by  which  thou  didst  grant  us  eternal  life  and 
forgiveness  of  sins;  for  thou  alone  art  compassionate.

npHOU  who  for  our  sake  wast  born  of  a  Virgin,  and 
didst  suffer  crucifixion,  O  good  One,  and  didst

O  merciful  One;  accept  the  intercession  of  thy  Mother,

T^HOU  hast  risen  from  the  dead,  O  Life  of  all.  And 
a  resplendent  angel  shouted  to  the  women.  Dry  your 
tears  and  proclaim  to  the  Apostles,  and  cry  out  in  praise, 
that  Christ  the  Lord  hath  risen,  he  who  hath  been 
pleased  to  save  mankind,  since  he  is  God. 

Glory:  Thou  hast  verily  risen  from  the  tomb;  and 
thou  didst  command  the  righteous  women  to  preach  to 
the  Apostles  the  Resurrection,  as  it  was  written.  And  as 
for  Peter,  he  did  hasten  to  the  tomb;  and  when  he  saw

saved  us  all,  O  our  Saviour,  who  still  remainest  in  truth 
the  Radiance  of  the  Father. 

Now:  Let  us  glorify  her  who  is  the  tabernacle  and 
the  heavenly  gate,  the  most  holy  mountain,  the  shining 
cloud,  the  heavenly  ladder,  the  paradise,  endowed  with 
speech,  the  deliverer  of  Eve,  the  precious  and  great 
treasure  of  the  universe;  for  by  her  did  salvation  come 
to  the  world,  and  the  forgiveness  of  ancient  sins.  Where- 
fore, do  we  cry  to  her,  Intercede  to  thy  Son  and  God 
to  grant  forgiveness  of  sins  to  those  who  bow  in  true 
worship  to  thy  most  holy  birth-giving.

proclaimed  to  thy  Disciples  in  Zion  that  thou  didst  rise, 
O  Life  of  all,  and  didst  break  asunder  the  bonds  of 
death,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory:  Verily,  when  the  women  came  with  burial 
ointment  they  heard  from  the  grave  an  angelic  voice, 
saying.  Cease  your  tears  and  receive  joy  instead  of  sor- 
row; and  cry  in  praise  that  Christ  the  Lord  is  risen, 
who  being  God  was  pleased  to  save  mankind. 

Now:  Verily,  all  creation  rejoiceth  in  thee,  O  full  of 
grace;  the  assemblies  of  angels  and  the  races  of  men, 
O  holy  temple  and  paradise  endowed  with  speech,  the 
pride  of  virginity  from  whom  God  was  incarnate  and 
became  a  child,  being  yet  our  God  before  the  ages;  for 
he  hath  made  thy  receptacle  a  throne  and  thy  womb 
more  spacious  than  the  heavens.  Wherefore,  O  full  of 
grace,  the  whole  creation  rejoiceth  in  thee  and  glorifieth

King;  and  as  a  Treasure  of  life,  they  sealed  thee.  But 
thou  didst  rise  and  grant  incorruptibility  to  our  souls. 

Thou  didst  give  us  thy  Cross,  O  Lord,  as  a  weapon 
against  Diabolus,  who,  unable  to  behold  its  power,  doth 
fear  and  tremble;  for  it  raiseth  the  dead  and  hath  an- 
nulled death.  Wherefore,  do  we  worship  thy  Burial 
and  Resurrection. 

The  angel  proclaiming  thy  Resurrection,  O  Lord, 
did  frighten  the  guards;  but  to  the  women  he  cried 
out,  saying.  Why  seek  ye  the  living  among  the  dead? 
Verily,  he  hath  risen,  being  God,  and  hath  granted  life 
to  the  universe. 

Thou  didst  suffer  by  the  Cross,  O  thou  unsuffering

days  that  thou  mightest  set  us  free  from  the  bondage  of 
the  enemy  and  grant  us  life  through  thy  Resurrection, 
O  Christ,  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

I  do  worship,  glorify,  and  praise  thy  Resurrection

us  from  the  fast  bonds  of  hades;  for,  being  God,  thou 
hast  granted  the  world  eternal  life  and  the  Great 
Mercy. 

Verily,  the  transgressors  of  the  law  guarded  thy  life- 
receiving  tomb,  and  didst  seal  it,  placing  guards.  But 
thou,  since  thou  art  a  deathless  and  almighty  God,  didst 
rise  on  the  third  day. 

When  thou  didst  pass  through  the  gates  of  hades  and 
didst  demolish  them,  then  its  captive  shouted,  saying, 
Who  is  this  who  is  judge  not  in  the  abyss  of  the  earth, 
but  who  hath  annulled  the  prison  of  death  as  though  it 
were  a  tabernacle?  For  verily,  I  have  received  him  as 
dead  and  have  feared  him  as  God.  Wherefore,  O  al-

TT^ERILY,  the  Lord  appeared  to  the  Disciples  going 
to  the  mountain  for  ascension  from  earthly  things; 
and  they  worshipped  him  and  learned  from  him  the

And  very  early  in  the  morning,  the  first  day  of  the

And  they  said  one  to  another:  Who  shall  roll  us  back 
the  stone  from  the  door  of  the  sepulchre? 

And  looking,  they  saw  the  stone  rolled  back.  For  it 
was  very  great. 

And  entering  into  the  sepulchre,  they  saw  a  young 
man  sitting  on  the  right  side,  clothed  with  a  white  robe: 
and  they  were  astonished. 

Who  saith  to  them :  Be  not  afifrighted ;  you  seek  Jesus 
of  Nazareth,  who  was  crucified:  he  is  risen,  he  is  not 
here,  behold  the  place  where  they  laid  him.

rolled,  and  a  divine  young  man  removed  all  anxiety  and 
trouble  from  their  souls  by  saying.  The  Lord  Jesus  hath 
risen.  Wherefore,  they  proclaimed  to  his  Disciples, 
that  they  should  hasten  to  Galilee  and  behold  him,  risen

A  ND  Christ,  rising  early  the  first  day  of  the  week, 
appeared  first  to  Mary  Magdalene,  out  of  whom 
he  cast  seven  devils. 

She  went  and  told  them  that  had  been  with  him,  who 
were  mourning  and  weeping. 


202  Matin  Gospels 

And  they  hearing  that  he  was  alive,  and  had  been 
seen  by  her,  did  not  believe. 

And  after  that,  he  appeared  in  another  shape  to  two 
of  them  walking,  as  they  were  going  into  the  country. 

And  they  going  told  it  to  the  rest:  neither  did  they 
believe  them. 

At  length  he  appeared  to  the  eleven  as  they  were  at 
table:  and  he  upbraided  them  with  their  incredulity 
and  hardness  of  heart,  because  they  did  not  believe 
them  who  had  seen  him  after  he  was  risen  again. 

And  he  said  to  them:  Go  ye  into  the  whole  world, 
and  preach  the  gospel  to  every  creature. 

He  that  believeth  and  is  baptized,  shall  be  saved: 
but  he  that  believeth  not  shall  be  condemned. 

And  these  signs  shall  follow  them  that  believe:  In 
my  name  they  shall  cast  out  devils:  they  shall  speak 
with  new  tongues. 

They  shall  take  up  serpents;  and  if  they  shall  drink 
any  deadly  thing,  it  shall  not  hurt  them:  they  shall  lay 
their  hands  upon  the  sick,  and  they  shall  recover. 

And  the  Lord  Jesus,  after  he  had  spoken  to  them, 
was  taken  up  into  heaven,  and  sitteth  on  the  right  hand 
of  God. 

But  they  going  forth  preached  every  where :  the  Lord

Third  Exaposteilarion 

^X/'ERILY,  Christ  is  risen.  Let  no  one  doubt,  or  be 
suspicious;  for  he  appeared  to  Mary,  and  after  that 
to  those  who  went  fishing.  Then  he  appeared  to  his 
eleven  initiates,  as  they  were  reclining,  whom  he  sent 
to  baptize.  And  he  ascended  to  heaven  whence  he  had 
descended,  establishing  his  warning  by  a  multitude  of 
wonders.

^l/'ERILY,  the  Disciples  were  taunted  for  the  hard- 
ness of  their  hearts  because  they  doubted  when 
Mary  Magdalene  proclaimed  to  them  the  fact  of  the 
Resurrection  of  the  Saviour  and  his  appearance  to  her. 
But,  when  they  were  armed  with  miracles  and  won- 
ders, they  were  sent  out  to  warn.  As  for  thee,  O  Lord, 
thou  didst  ascend  to  thy  Father,  the  Element  of  all 
light;  and  they  preached  in  every  place  verifying 
their  words  with  wonders  and  miracles.  Wherefore, 
we  who  were  enlightened  by  them  glorify  thy  Resur- 
rection from  the  dead,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

The  Fourth  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (24:1-12) 

/^N  the  first  day  of  the  week,  very  early  in  the  morn- 
^^^  ing,  the  women  came  to  the  sepulchre,  bringing  the 
spices  which  they  had  prepared,  and  certain  others  with 
them. 

And  they  found  the  stone  rolled  back  from  the  sep- 
ulchre. 

And  going  in,  they  found  not  the  body  of  the  Lord 
Jesus. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  as  they  were  astonished  in  their 
mind  at  this,  behold,  two  men  stood  by  them,  in  shin- 
ing apparel. 

And  as  they  were  afraid,  and  bowed  down  their  coun- 
tenance towards  the  ground,  they  said  unto  them:  Why 
seek  you  the  living  with  the  dead? 

He  is  not  here,  but  is  risen.  Remember  how  he  spoke 
unto  you,  when  he  was  yet  in  Galilee, 

Saying:  The  Son  of  man  must  be  delivered  into  the 
hands  of  sinful  men,  and  be  crucified,  and  the  third 
day  rise  again. 


204  Matin  Gospels 

And  they  remembered  his  words. 

And  going  back  from  the  sepulchre,  they  told  all 
these  things  to  the  eleven,  and  to  all  the  rest. 

And  it  was  Mary  Magdalene,  and  Joanna,  and  Mary 
of  James,  and  the  other  women  that  were  with  them, 
who  told  these  things  to  the  apostles. 

And  these  words  seemed  to  them  as  idle  tales;  and 
they  did  not  believe  them. 

But  Peter  rising  up,  ran  to  the  sepulchre,  and  stoop- 
ing down,  he  saw  the  linen  cloths  laid  by  themselves; 
and  went  away  wondering  in  himself  at  that  which  was 
come  to  pass. 

Fourth  Exaposteilarion

Lord  of  heaven  and  hasten  with  Peter  to  the  tomb  and 
wonder  at  the  great  happening,  waiting  to  behold  Christ 
the  Life. 

To  our  Lady

A/EERILY,  the  women  came  at  early  dawn  to  thy 
tomb,  O  Christ,  but  they  found  not  thy  body,  pre- 
cious to  them.  And  as  they  were  perplexed,  behold 
there  stood  among  them  those  who  were  in  shining 
clothes  who  said  to  them.  Why  seek  ye  the  living  among 
the  dead?     He  hath  risen  as  he  foretold.     Why  have 


Matin  Gospels  205 

ye  forgotten  his  words?  And  when  they  were  assured 
by  their  saying,  they  preached  to  the  Disciples  the 
things  seen.  But  their  glad  tidings  were  received  with 
ridicule;  for  they  were  still  without  understanding.  But 
Peter  hastened  to  behold,  and  glorified  thy  wonders  in 
himself. 

The  Fifth  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (24:12-35) 

AT  that  time:  Peter  rising  up,  ran  to  the  sepulchre, 
and  stooping  down,  he  saw  the  linen  cloths  laid  by 
themselves,  and  went  away  wondering  in  himself  at  that 
which  was  come  to  pass. 

And  behold,  two  of  them  went,  the  same  day,  to  a 
town  which  was  sixty  furlongs  from  Jerusalem,  named 
Emmaus. 

And  they  talked  together  of  all  these  things  which 
had  happened. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that  while  they  talked  and  rea- 
soned with  themselves,  Jesus  himself  also  drawing  near, 
went  with  them. 

But  their  eyes  were  held,  that  they  should  not  know 
him. 

And  he  said  to  them:  What  are  these  discourses  that 
you  hold  one  with  another  as  you  walk,  and  are  sad? 

And  the  one  of  them,  whose  name  was  Cleophas^ 
answering,  said  to  him:  Art  thou  only  a  stranger  in 
Jerusalem,  and  hast  not  known  the  things  that  have  been 
done  there  in  these  days? 

To  whom  he  said:  What  things?  And  they  said: 
Concerning  Jesus  of  Nazareth,  who  was  a  prophet, 
mighty  in  work  and  word  before  God  and  all  the 
people; 

And  how  our  chief  priests  and  princes  delivered  him 
to  be  condemned  to  death,  and  crucified  him. 

But  we  hoped,  that  it  was  he  that  should  have  re- 
deemed Israel:  and  now  besides  all  this,  to  day  is  the 
third  day  since  these  things  were  done. 


206  Matin  Gospels 

Yea  and  certain  women  also  of  our  company  affright- 
ed us,  who  before  it  was  light,  were  at  the  sepulchre. 

And  not  finding  his  body,  came  saying,  that  they  had 
also  seen  a  vision  of  angels,  who  say  that  he  is  alive. 

And  some  of  our  people  went  to  the  sepulchre,  and 
found  it  so  as  the  women  had  said,  but  him  they  found 
not. 

Then  he  said  to  them:  O  foolish,  and  slow  of  heart 
to  believe  in  all  things  which  the  prophets  have  spoken. 

Ought  not  Christ  to  have  suffered  these  things,  and 
so  to  enter  into  his  glory? 

And  beginning  at  Moses  and  all  the  prophets,  he  ex- 
pounded to  them  in  all  the  scriptures,  the  things  that 
were  concerning  him. 

And  they  drew  nigh  to  the  town,  whither  they  were 
going:  and  he  made  as  though  he  would  go  farther. 

But  they  constrained  him;  saying:  Stay  with  us,  be- 
cause it  is  towards  evening^  and  the  day  is  now  far 
spent.    And  he  went  in  with  them. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  whilst  he  was  at  table  with  them, 
he  took  bread,  and  blessed,  and  brake,  and  gave  to  them. 

And  their  eyes  were  opened,  and  they  knew  him: 
and  he  vanished  out  of  their  sight. 

And  they  said  one  to  the  other:  Was  not  our  heart 
burning  within  us,  whilst  he  spoke  in  the  way,  and 
opened  to  us  the  scriptures? 

And  rising  up,  the  same  hour,  they  went  back  to 
Jerusalem :  and  they  found  the  eleven  gathered  to- 
gether, and  those  that  were  with  them. 

Saying:  The  Lord  is  risen  indeed,  and  hath  appeared 
to  Simon. 

And  they  told  what  things  were  done  in  the  way;  and 
how  they  knew  him  in  the  breaking  of  bread. 

Fifth  Exaposteilarion 

TT'ERILY,  Christ  who  is  the  Way  and  the  Life,  after 

his  Resurrection  from  the  dead,  accompanied  Luke 

and  Cleopas,  who  had  recognized  him  at  Emmaus,  in 


Matin  Gospels  207 

the  breaking  of  the  bread,  whose  hearts  and  souls  were 
inflamed  as  he  spake  to  them  in  the  way,  explaining  to 
them  from  the  books  about  all  that  he  had  suffered.  Let 
us,  therefore,  shout  with  them  crying,  Verily,  the  Lord 
hath  risen  and  appeared  unto  Peter. 

To  our  Lady 

T  PRAISE  thy  countless  mercy,  my  Creator;  for  thou 
didst  empty  thyself  to  put  on  the  suffering  nature  of 
man,  and  save  it.  And  whereas  thou  art  God,  thou 
didst  consent  for  my  sake  t'o  become  like  me  from  the 
pure  Maiden  of  God,  and  to  descend  to  hades,  willing 
to  save  me  by  the  intercession  of  thy  Mother,  O  all- 
compassionate  Lord. 

Fifth  Eothina — Glory,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

T-TOW  wise  are  thy  judgments,  O  Christ,  in  that  thou 
didst  grant  Peter  to  understand  thy  Resurrection 
by  the  coffin  wrappings  alone;  whereas  Luke  and  Cleo- 
pas  thou  didst  accompany  conversing;  and  as  thou  didst 
so  thou  didst  not  reveal  thyself  to  them,  and  thou  wast 
taunted  by  them  as  though  thou  alone  wert  a  stranger  in 
Jerusalem,  not  knowing  what  had  happened  therein  of 
late.  But  since  thou  ordainest  all  things  in  conformity 
with  thy  creation,  thou  didst  explain  to  them  what  the 
Prophets  had  uttered  concerning  thee,  and  in  the  break- 
ing of  the  bread  they  knew  thee  after  their  hearts  were 
aflame  for  thy  knowledge;  and  when  they  came  to- 
gether with  the  Disciples  they  proclaimed  openly  the 
Resurrection,  by  which  have  mercy  upon  us. 

The  Sixth  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (24:36  to  End) 

A  T  that  time:  Jesus  after  rising  from  the  dead  stoo,d 
in  the  midst  of  his  disciples  and  saith  to  them: 
Peace  be  unto  you. 

But  they  being  troubled  and  frightened,  supposed 
that  they  saw  a  spirit. 


208  Matin  Gospels 

And  he  said  to  them :  Why  are  you  troubled,  and  why 
do  thoughts  arise  in  your  hearts? 

See  my  hands  and  feet,  that  it  is  I  myself;  handle, 
and  see:  for  a  spirit  hath  not  flesh  and  bones,  as  you  see 
me  to  have. 

And  when  he  had  said  this,  he  showed  them  his  hands 
and  feet. 

But  while  they  yet  believed  not,  and  wondered  for 
joy,  he  said:    Have  you  here  any  thing  to  eat? 

And  they  offered  him  a  piece  of  a  broiled  fish,  and  a 
honeycomb. 

And  when  he  had  eaten  before  them,  taking  the  re- 
mains, he  gave  to  them. 

And  he  said  to  them :  These  are  the  words  which  I 
spoke  to  you,  while  I  was  yet  with  you,  that  all  things 
must  needs  be  fulfilled,  which  are  written  in  the  law  of 
Moses,  and  in  the  prophets,  and  in  the  psalms,  concern- 
ing me. 

Then  he  opened  their  understanding,  that  they  might 
understand  the  scriptures. 

And  he  said  to  them:  Thus  it  is  written,  and  thus  it 
behoved  Christ  to  suffer,  and  to  rise  again  from  the 
dead,  the  third  day: 

And  that  penance  and  remission  of  sins  should  be 
preached  in  his  name,  unto  all  nations,  beginning  at 
Jerusalem. 

And  you  are  witnesses  of  these  things. 

And  I  send  the  promise  of  my  Father  upon  you:  but 
stay  you  in  the  city,  till  you  be  endued  with  power  from 
on  high. 

And  he  led  them  out  as  far  as  Bethania:  and  lifting 
up  his  hands,  he  blessed  them. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  whilst  he  blessed  them,  he  de- 
parted from  them,  and  was  carried  up  to  heaven. 

And  they  adoring  went  back  into  Jerusalem  with 
great  joy. 

And  they  were  always  in  the  temple,  praising  and 
blessing  God.

A  ND  on  the  first  day  of  the  week,  Mary  Magdalene 
Cometh  early,  when  it  was  yet  dark,  unto  the  sepul- 
chre; and  she  saw  the  stone  taken  away  from  the  sep- 
ulchre. 


210  Matin  Gospels 

She  ran,  therefore,  and  cometh  to  Simon  Peter,  and 
to  the  other  disciple  whom  Jesus  loved,  and  saith  to 
them :  They  have  taken  away  the  Lord  out  of  the  sepul- 
chre, and  we  know  not  where  they  have  laid  him. 

Peter  therefore  went  out,  and  that  other  disciple,  and 
they  came  to  the  sepulchre. 

And  they  both  ran  together,  and  that  other  disciple 
diid  outrun  Peter,  and  came  first  to  the  sepulchre. 

And  when  he  stooped  down,  he  saw  the  linen  cloths 
lying;  but  yet  he  went  not  in. 

Then  cometh  Simon  Peter,  following  him,  and  went 
into  the  sepulchre,  and  saw  the  linen  cloths  lying, 

And  the  napkin  that  had  been  about  his  head,  not 
lying  with  the  linen  cloths,  but  apart,  wrapped  up  into 
one  place. 

Then  that  other  disciple  also  went  in,  who  came  first 
to  the  sepulchre:  and  he  saw,  and  believed. 

For  as  yet  they  knew  not  the  scripture,  that  he  must 
rise  again  from  the  dead. 

The  disciples  therefore  departed  again  to  their  home.

The  Eighth  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (20:11-18) 

AT  that  time:  Mary  was  standing  at  the  sepulchre 
without,  weeping.  Now  as  she  was  weeping,  she 
stooped  down,  and  looked  into  the  sepulchre. 

And  she  saw  two  angels  in  white,  sitting,  one  at  the 
head,  and  one  at  the  feet,  where  the  body  of  Jesus  had 
been  laid. 

They  say  to  her:  Woman,  why  weepest  thou?  She 
saith  to  them:  Because  they  have  taken  away  my  Lord; 
and  I  know  not  where  they  have  laid  him. 

When  she  haid  thus  said,  she  turned  herself  back, 
and  saw  Jesus  standing;  and  she  knew  not  that  it  was 
Jesus. 

Jesus  saith  to  her :  Woman,  why  weepest  thou?  whom 
seekest  thou?  She,  thinking  that  it  was  the  gardener, 
saith  to  him:  Sir,  if  thou  hast  taken  him  hence,  tell  me 
where  thou  hast  laid  him,  and  I  will  take  him  away. 

Jesus  saith  to  her:  Mary.  She  turning,  saith  to  him: 
Rabboni  (which  is  to  say.  Master). 

Jesus  saith  to  her:  Do  not  touch  me,  for  I  am  not  yet 
ascended  to  my  Father.  But  go  to  my  brethren,  and 
say  to  them :  I  ascend  to  my  Father  and  to  your  Father, 
to  my  God  and  your  God.

she  was  a  weak  woman  she  was  still  thinking  of  earthly 
things.  Therefore,  was  she  put  ofif  from  touching  thee, 
O  Christ.  But  she  was  sent  to  proclaim  to  thy  Dis-

were  gathered  together,  for  fear  of  the  Jews,  Jesus  came 
and  stood  in  the  midst,  and  said  to  them:  Peace  be  to 
you. 

And  when  he  had  said  this,  he  showed  them  his  hands 
and  his  side.  The  disciples  therefore  were  glad,  when 
they  saw  the  Lord, 


Matin  Gospels  213 

He  said  therefore  to  them  again :  Peace  be  to  you. 
As  the  Father  hath  sent  me,  I  also  send  you. 

When  he  had  said  this,  he  breathed  on  them;  and  he 
said  to  them :  Receive  ye  the  Holy  Ghost. 

Whose  sins  you  shall  forgive,  they  are  forgiven  them; 
and  whose  sins  you  shall  retain,  they  are  retained. 

Now  Thomas,  one  of  the  twelve,  who  is  called  Didy- 
mus,  was  not  with  them  when  Jesus  came. 

The  other  disciples  therefore  said  to  him:  We  have 
seen  the  Lord.  But  he  said  to  them:  Except  I  shall 
see  in  his  hands  the  print  of  the  nails,  and  put  my  finger 
into  the  place  of  the  nails,  and  put  my  hand  into  his 
side,  I  will  not  believe. 

And  after  eight , days  again  his  disciples  were  within, 
and  Thomas  with  them.  Jesus  cometh,  the  doors  being 
shut,  and  stood  in  the  midst,  and  said :  Peace  be  to  you. 

Then  he  saith  to  Thomas:  Put  in  thy  finger  hither, 
and  see  my  hands;  and  bring  hither  thy  hand,  and  put 
it  into  my  side;  and  be  not  faithless,  but  believing. 

Thomas  answered,  and  said  to  him:  My  Lord,  and 
my  God. 

Jesus  saith  to  him:  Because  thou  hast  seen  me, 
Thomas,  thou  hast  believed:  blessed  are  they  that  have 
not  seen,  and  have  believed. 

Many  other  signs  also  did  Jesus  in  the  sight  of  his 
disciples,  which  are  not  written  in  this  book. 

But  these  are  written,  that  you  may  believe  that 
Jesus  is  the  Christ,  the  Son  of  God:  and  that  believing, 
you  may  have  life  in  his  "name. 

Ninth  Exaposteilarion 

V\/HEN  thou  didst  enter  while  the  doors  were  closed, 
^'^  O  Lord,  then  thou  didst  fill  thine  Apostles  with  a 
holy  spirit,  breathing;  into  them  peace,  and  saying  unto 
them.  Loosen  ye  and  bind  ye  sins.  And  after  eight  days 
thou  didst  show  Thomas  thy  hands  and  thy  side.  With 
him,  therefore,  do  we  cry  to  thee,  Thou  art  the  Lord  and 
God. 


214  Matin  Gospels 

To  our  Lady 

TI/^HEN  thou  didst  behold  thy  Son  rising  from  the 
tomb  after  three  days,  O  most  holy  bride  of  God, 
thou  didst  put  away  all  sorrow  which  thou  hadst  borne 
as  Mother  when  thou  beheld  him  suffering. 

Ninth  Eothina — Glory,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

TN  the  fullness  of  time,  O  Christ,  thou  didst  appear 
among  thy  beloved  ones  on  the  eve  of  the  sabbath, 
and  didst  confirm  to  them  a  wonder  through  a  won- 
der, namely  thy  Resurrection  from  the, dead  by  thine  en- 
trance while  the  doors  were  closed.  But  thou  didst  fill 
the  Disciples  with  joy,  granting  them  a  holy  spirit,  and 
didst  bestow  on  them  power  to  forgive  sins.  And  as  for 
Thomas,  thou  didst  not  permit  him  to  drown  in  the 
depths  of  faithlessness.  Wherefore,  grant  us  the  knowl- 
edge of  the  truth,  and  forgiveness  of  sins,  O  compas- 
sionate Lord. 

The  Tenth  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (21:1-14) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  showed  himself  again  to  his  dis- 
ciples at  the  sea  of  Tiberias.  And  he  showed  him- 
self after  this  manner. 

There  were  together  Simon  Peter,  and  Thomas,  who 
is  called  Didymus,  and  Nathanael,  who  was  of  Cana 
of  Galilee,  and  the  sons  of  Zebedee,  and  two  others  of 
his  disciples. 

Simon  Peter  saith  to  them:  I  go  a  fishing.  They  say 
to  him  :  We  also  come  with  thee.  And  they  went  forth, 
and  entered  into  the  ship:  and  that  night  they  caught 
nothing. 

But  when  the  morning  was  come,  Jesus  stood  on  the 
shore:  yet  the  disciples  knew  not  that  it  was  Jesus. 

Jesus  therefore  said  to  them:  Children,  have  you  any 
meat?    They  answered  him:  No. 

He  saith  to  them:  Cast  the  net  on  the  right  side  of 
the  ship,  and  you  shall  find.    They  cast  therefore;  and 


Matin  Gospels  215 

now  they  were  not  able  to  draw  it,  for  the  multitude  of 
fishes. 

That  disciple  therefore  whom  Jesus  loved,  said  to 
Peter :  It  is  the  Lord.  Simon  Peter,  when  he  heard  that 
it  was  the  Lord,  girt  his  coat  about  him,  (for  he  was 
naked,)  and  cast  himself  into  the  sea. 

But  the  other  disciples  came  in  the  ship,  (for  they 
were  not  far  from  the  land,  but  as  it  were  two  hundred 
cubits,)  dragging  the  net  with  fishes. 

As  soon  then  as  they  came  to  land,  they  saw  hot  coals 
lying,  and  a  fish  laid  thereon,  and  bread. 

Jesus  saith  to  them:  Bring  hither  of  the  fishes  which 
you  have  now  caught. 

Simon  Peter  went  up,  and  drew  the  net  to  land,  full 
of  great  fishes,  one  hundred  and  fifty-three.  And  al- 
though there  were  so  many,  the  net  was  not  broken. 

Jesus  saith  to  them:  Come,  and  dine.  And  none  of 
them  who  were  at  meat,  durst  ask  him :  Who  art  thou? 
knowing  that  it  was  the  Lord. 

And  Jesus  comejth  and  taketh  bread  and  giveth  them, 
and  fish  in  like  manner. 

This  is  now  the  third  time  that  Jesus  was  manifested 
to  his  disciples,  after  he  was  risen  from  the  dead. 

Tenth  Exaposteilarion 

'X/'ERILY,  the  two  sons  of  Zebedee  with  Peter  and 
Nathaniel  and  two  others  and  Thomas  were  fish- 
ing in  the  Lake  of  Tiberias,  who  by  the  command  of 
Christ  cast  the  net  on  the  right  side  and  drew  out  much 
fish.  And  when  Peter  knew^  him  he  came  to  him  swim- 
ming. This,  then,  was  a  third  appearance  of  the  Lord, 
when  he  showed  them  bread  and  fish  on  the  live  coals. 

To  our  Lady 

pRAY  for  us,  O  Virgin,  to  the  Lord  who  rose  from 
^  the  tomb  on  the  third  day,  even  for  us  Christians 
who  praise  and  bless  thee  with  zeal;  for  we  have  all 
taken  thee  as  a  refuge  of  salvation  and  as  a  mediatrix 


216  Matin  Gospels 

with  him;  for  we  are  thy  servants,  O  Theotokos,  and 
thine  inheritors,  and  we  all  await  thy  help. 

Tenth  Eothina — Glory,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

A  FTER  thy  descent  to  hades,  O  Christ,  and  thy  Res- 
urrection  from  the  dead,  the  Disciples  sorrowed, 
as  was  fitting,  grieving  over  thy  removal.  They  re- 
turned to  their  occupations  and  attended  to  their  nets 
and  their  ships;  but  there  was  no  fishing  whatsoever. 
But  thou  didst  appear  to  them,  and,  since  thou  art  Lord 
of  all,  thou  didst  command  them  to  cast  the  nets  on  the 
right  side.  And  at  once  the  word  became  deed  and  they 
caught  much  fish  and  found  a  strange  meal  prepared 
for  them  on  the  ground.  And  thy  Disciples  at  once 
partook  thereof. 

And  now,  make  us  worthy  with  them  to  enjoy  it  men- 
tally, O  Lord,  Lover  of  mankind. 

The  Eleventh  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (21:14  to 

End) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  showed  himself  to  his  disciples, 
after  he  was  risen  from  the  dead. 

When  therefore  they  had  dined,  Jesus  saith  to  Simon 
Peter:  Simon,  son  of  John,  lovest  thou  me  more  than 
these?  He  saith  to  him:  Yea,  Lord,  thou  knowest  that 
I  love  thee.    He  saith  to  him:  Feed  my  lambs. 

He  said  to  him  again:  Simon,  son  of  John,  lovest 
thou  me?  He  saith  to  him:  Yea,  Lord,  thou  knowest 
that  I  love  thee.     He  saith  to  him:  Feed  my  lambs. 

He  said  to  him  the  third  time:  Simon,  son  of  John, 
lovest  thou  me?  Peter  was  grieved,  because  he  had 
said  to  him  the  third  time:  Lovest  thou  me?  And  he 
said  to  him:  Lord,  thou  knowest  all  things:  thou  know- 
est that  I  love  thee.    He  said  to  him:  Feed  my  sheep. 

Amen,  amen,  I  say  to  thee,  when  thou  wast  younger, 
thou  didst  gird  thyself,  and  didst  walk  where  thou 
wouldst.    But  when  thou  shalt  be  old,  thou  shalt  stretch 


Matin  Gospels  217 

forth  tliy  hands,  and  another  shall  gird  thee,  and  lead 
thee  whither  thou  wouldst  not. 

/\nd  this  he  said,  signifying  by  what  death  he  should 
glorify  God.  And  when  he  had  said  this,  he  saith  to 
him :  Follow  me. 

Peter  turning  about,  saw  that  disciple  whom  Jesus 
loved  following,  who  also  leaned  on  his  breast  at  sup- 
per, and  said:  Lord,  who  is  he  that  shall  betray  thee? 

Him  therefore  when  Peter  had  seen,  he  saith  to  Jesus : 
Lord,  and  what  shall  this  man  do? 

Jesus  saith  to  him:  So  I  will  have  him  to  remain  till 
I  come,  what  is  it  to  thee?  follow  thou  me. 

This  saying  therefore  went  abroad  among  the  breth- 
ren, that  that  disciple  should  not  die.  And  Jesus  did 
not  say  to  him:  He  should  not  die;  but,  So  I  will  have 
him  to  remain  till  I  come,  what  is  it  to  thee? 

This  is  that  disciple  who  giveth  testimony  of  these 
things,  and  hath  written  these  things;  and  we  know 
that  his  testimony  is  true. 

But  there  are  also  many  other  things  which  Jesus  did ; 
which,  if  they  were  written  every  one,  the  world  itself, 
I  think,  would  not  be  able  to  contain  the  books  that 
should  be  written. 

Eleventh  Exaposteilarion 

Vl/'HEN  the  Lord,  after  his  Resurrection,  asked 
Peter  thrice.  Dost  thou  love  me,  he  set  him  for 
a  shepherd  over  his  sheep.  And  when  Peter  saw  the 
Disciple  whom  Jesus  loved  following  him,  he  asked 
the  Lord,  And  what  is  this?  And  the  Lord  said.  If  I 
will  that  he  tarry  until  I  come  again,  what  is  that  to 
thee,  O  Peter  my  beloved. 

To  our  Lady 

TT7HAT  a  terrible  mystery,  what  a  dazzling  wonder; 

^^    for    death    hath    been    abolished    completely    by 

Death.    Who,  then,  will  not  praise,  and  who  will  not

V\/^HEN  thou  ididst  show  thyself  to  the  Disciples 
after  thy  Resurrection,  O  Saviour,  thou  didst  ap- 
point Simon  to  shepherd  the  sheep,  for  the  renewal  of 
love,  asking  him  to  tend  the  flock.  And  thou  didst  say 
to  him,  If  thou  lovest  me,  O  Peter,  feed  my  lambs,  feed 
my  sheep.  But  he  at  once  inquired  concerning  the 
other  Disciple,  showing  his  exceeding  love.  Where- 
fore, by  the  intercession  of  both,  O  Christ,  keep  thy 
flock  from  corrupting  wolves.

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the>  Hebrews 
(11:33  to  end;  12:1-2) 

VT'E  brethren:  All  the  saints  by  faith  subdued  king- 
-*■  doms,  wrought  righteousness,  obtained  promises, 
stopped  the  mouths  of  lions. 

Quenched  the  violence  of  fire,  escaped  the  edge  of 
the  sword,  out  of  weakness  were  made  strong,  waxed 
valiant  in  fight,  turned  to  flight  the  armies  of  the  aliens. 

Women  received  their  dead  raised  to  life  again:  and 
others  were  tortured,  not  accepting  deliverance;  that 
they  might  obtain  a  better  resurrection: 


220  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  others  had  trial  of  cruel  mockings  and  scourg- 
ings,  yea,  moreover  o^  bonds  and  imprisonment: 

They  were  stoned,  they  were  sawn  asunder,  were 
tempted,  were  slain  with  the  sword:  they  wandered 
about  in  sheepskins  and  goatskins;  being  destitute,  af- 
flicted, tormented; 

Of  whom  the  world  was  not  worthy:  they  wandered 
in  deserts,  and  in  mountains,  and  in  dens  and  caves  of 
the  earth. 

And  these  all,  having  obtained  a  good  report  through 
faith,  received  not  the  promise: 

God  having  provided  some  better  thing  for  us,  that 
they  without  us  should  not  be  made  perfect. 

Wherefore,  seeing  we  also  are  compassed  about  with 
so  great  a  cloud  of  witnesses,  let  us  lay  aside  every 
weight,  and  the  sin  which  doth  so  easily  beset  us,  and 
let  us  run  with  patience  the  race  that  is  set  before  us, 

Looking  unto  Jesus  the  author  and  finisher  of  our 
faith;  who  for  the  joy  that  was  set  before  him  endured 
the  cross,  despising  the  shame,  and  is  set  down  at  the 
right  hand  of  the  throne  of  God. 


The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (10 :32-33; 37-38 ; 
19:27  to  end) 

npHE  Lord  saith  to  his  disciples:  Whosoever  there- 
fore shall  confess  me  before  men,  him  will  I  con- 
fess also  before  my  Father  which  is  in  heaven. 

But  whosoever  shall  deny  me  before  men,  him  will  I 
also  deny  before  my  Father  which  is  in  heaven. 

He  that  loveth  father  or  mother  more  than  me  is  not 
worthy  of  me:  and  he  that  loveth  son  or  daughter  more 
than  me  is  not  worthy  of  me. 

And  he  that  taketh  not  his  cross,  and  followeth  after 
me,  is  not  worthy  of  me. 

Then  answered  Peter  and  said  unto  him,  Behold,  we 
have  forsaken  all,  and  followed  thee;  what  shall  we 
have  therefore? 


Epistles  and  Gospels  221 

And  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Verily  I  say  unto  you, 
That  ye  which  have  followed  me,  in  the  regeneration 
when  the  Son  of  man  shall  sit  in  the  throne  of  his  glory, 
ye  also  shall  sit  upon  twelve  thrones,  judging  the  twelve 
tribes  of  Israel. 

And  every  one  that  hath  forsaken  houses,  or  brethren, 
or  sisters,  or  father,  or  mother,  or  wife,  or  children,  or 
lands,  for  my  name's  sake,  shall  receive  a  hundredfold, 
and  shall  inherit  everlasting  life. 

But  many  that  are  first  shall  be  last;  and  the  last  shall 
be  first. 

Second  Sunday 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  First  Tone 

Let  thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  be  upon  us. 
Rejoice  in  the  Lord,  O  ye  just. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Romans 
(2:10-16) 

'Y^E  brethren:  Glory,  honour,  and  peace  to  every  man 
^  that  worketh  good,  to  the  Jew  first,  and  also  to  the 
Gentile: 

For  there  is  no  respect  of  persons  with  God. 

For  as  many  as  have  sinned  without  law  shall  also 
perish  without  law;  and  as  many  as  have  sinned  in  the 
law  shall  be  judged  by  the  law; 

(For  not  the  hearers  of  the  law  are  just  before  God, 
but  the  doers  of  the  law  shall  be  justified. 

For  when  the  Gentiles,  which  have  not  the  law,  do 
by  nature  the  things  contained  in  the  law,  these,  having 
not  the  law,  are  a  law  unto  themselves: 

Which  show  the  work  of  the  law  written  in  their 
hearts,  their  conscience  also  bearing  witness,  and  their 
thoughts  the  mean  while  accusing  or  else  excusing  one 
another;) 

In  the  day  when  God  shall  judge  the  secrets  of  men 
by  Jesus  Christ  according  to  my  gospel. 


222  Epistles  and  Gospels 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (4:18-23) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus,  walking  by  the  sea  of  Galilee, 
^  ^saw  two  brethren,  Simon  called  Peter,  and  Andrew 
his  brother,  casting  a  net  into  the  sea;  for  they  were 
fishers. 

And  he  saith  unto  them.  Follow  me,  and  I  will  make 
you  fishers  of  men. 

And  they  straightway  left  their  nets,  and  followed 
him. 

And  going  on  from  thence,  he  saw  other  two  breth- 
ren, James  the  son  of  Zebedee,  and  John  his  brother,  in 
a  ship  with  Zebedee  their  father,  mending  their  nets; 
and  he  called  them. 

And  they  immediately  left  the  ship  and  their  father, 
and  followed  him. 

And  Jesus  went  about  all  Galilee,  teaching  in  their 
synagogues,  and  preaching  the  gospel  of  the  kingdom, 
and  healing  all  manner  of  sickness  and  all  manner  of 
disease  among  the  people. 

Third  Sunday 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Second  Tone 

The  Lord  is  my  strength  and  my  praise. 
The  Lord  chastising  hath  chastised  me. 

Section  from   the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to   the  Romans 

(5:1-10) 

XT'E  brethren:  Therefore  being  justified  by  faith,  we 
^  have  peace  with  God  through  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ: 

By  whom  also  we  have  access  by  faith  into  this  grace 
wherein  we  stand,  and  rejoice  in  hope  of  the  glory  of 
God. 

And  not  only  so,  but  we  glory  in  tribulations  also; 
knowing  that  tribulation  worketh  patience; 

And  patience,  experience;  and  experience,  hope. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  223 

And  hope  maketh  not  ashamed;  because  the  love  of 
God  is  shed  abroad  in  our  hearts  by  the  Holy  Ghost 
which  is  given  unto  us. 

For  when  we  were  yet  without  strength,  in  due  time 
Christ  died  for  the  ungodly. 

For  scarcely  for  a  righteous  man  will  one  die:  yet 
peradventure  for  a  good  man  some  would  even  dare 
to  die. 

But  God  commendeth  his  love  toward  us,  in  that, 
while  we  were  yet  sinners,  Christ  died  for  us. 

Much  more  then,  being  now  justified  by  his  blood, 
we  shall  be  saved  from  wrath  through  him. 

For  if,  when  we  were  enemies,  we  were  reconciled  to 
God  by  the  death  of  his  Son;  much  more,  being  recon- 
ciled, we  shall  be  saved  by  his  life. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (6:22-33) 

T^HE  Lord  said:  The  light  of  the  body  is  the  eye: 
if  therefore  thine  eye  be  single,  thy  whole  body 
shall  be  full  of  light. 

But  if  thine  eye  be  evil,  thy  whole  body  shall  be  full 
of  darkness.  If  therefore  the  light  that  is  in  thee  be 
darkness,  how  great  is  that  darkness! 

No  man  can  serve  two  masters :  for  either  he  will 
hate  the  one,  and  love  the  other;  or  else  he  will  hold  to 
the  one,  and  despise  the  other.  Ye  cannot  serve  God 
and  mammon. 

Therefore  I  say  unto  you,  Take  no  thought  for  your 
life,  what  ye  shall  eat,  or  what  ye  shall  drink;  nor  yet 
for  your  body,  what  ye  shall  put  on.  Is  not  the  life  more 
than  meat,  and  the  body  than  raiment? 

Behold  the  fowls  of  the  air:  for  they  sow  not,  neither 
do  they  reap,  nor  gather  into  barns;  yet  your  heavenly 
Father  fcedeth  them.  Are  ye  not  much  better  than 
they? 

Which  of  you  by  taking  thought  can  add  one  cubit 
unto  his  stature? 


224  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  why  take  ye  thought  for  raiment?  Consider  the 
lilies  of  the  field,  how  they  grow;  they  toil  not,  neither 
do  they  spin: 

And  yet  I  say  unto  you.  That  even  Solomon  in  all 
his  glory  was  not  arrayed  like  one  of  these. 

Wherefore,  if  God  so  clothe  the  grass  of  the  field, 
which  to-day  is,  and  to-morrow  is  cast  into  the  oven, 
shall  he  not  much  more  clothe  you,  O  ye  of  little  faith? 

Therefore  take  no  thought,  saying,  What  shall  we 
eat,  or  what  shall  we  drink,  or  wherewithal  shall  we 
be  clothed? 

(For  after  all  these  things  do  the  Gentiles  seek)  for 
your  heavenly  Father  knoweth  that  ye  have  need  of  all 
these  things. 

But  seek  ye  first  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  his  right- 
eousness; and  all  these  things  shall  be  added  unto  you. 

Fourth  Sunday 

Prokeimenon  in  the  Third  Tone 

Sing  praises  to  our  God,  sing  praises. 

0  clap  your  hands  all  ye  nations. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  Saint  Paul  to  the  Romans 

(6:18-end) 

XT'E  brethren:  Being  then  made  free  from  sin,  ye  be- 
-■■    came  the  servants  of  righteousness. 

1  speak  after  the  manner  of  men  because  of  the  in- 
firmity of  your  flesh :  for  as  ye  have  yielded  your  mem- 
bers servants  to  uncleanness  and  to  iniquity  unto  in- 
iquity; even  so  now  yield  your  members  servants  to 
righteousness  unto  holiness. 

For  when  ye  were  the  servants  of  sin,  ye  were  free 
from  righteousness. 

What  fruit  had  ye  then  in  those  things  whereof  ye 
are  now  ashamed?  for  the  end  of  those  things  is  death. 

But  now  being  made  free  from  sin,  and  become  serv 
vants  to  God,  ye  have  your  fruit  unto  holiness,  and  the 
end  everlasting  life. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  225 

For  the  wages  of  sin  is  death;  but  the  gift  of  God  is 
eternal  life  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (8:5-13) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  entered  into  Capernaum, 
there  came  unto  him  a  centurion,  beseeching  him, 

And  saying,  Lord,  my  servant  lieth  at  home  sick  of 
the  palsy,  grieviously  tormented. 

And  Jesus  saith  unto  him,  I  will  come  and  heal  him. 

The  centurion  answered  and  said,  Lord,  I  am  not 
worthy  that  thou  shouldest  come  under  my  roof :  but 
speak  the  word  only,  and  my  servant  shall  be  healed. 

For  I  am  a  man  under  authority,  having  soldiers 
under  me:  and  I  say  to  this  man.  Go,  and  he  goeth; 
and  to  another,  Come,  and  he  cometh ;  and  to  my  serv- 
ant, Do  this,  and  he  doeth  it. 

When  Jesus  heard  it,  he  marveled,  and  said  to  them 
that  followed,  Verily  I  say  unto  you,  I  have  not  found 
so  great  faith,  no,  not  in  Israel. 

And  I  say  unto  you.  That  many  shall  come  from  the 
east  and  west,  and  shall  sit  down  with  Abraham,  and 
Isaac,  and  Jacob,  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven: 

But  the  children  of  the  kingdom  shall  be  cast  out 
into  outer  darkness:  there  shall  be  weeping  and  gnash- 
ing of  teeth. 

And  Jesus  said  unto  the  centurion,  Go  thy  way;  and 
as  thou  hast  believed,  so  be  it  done  unto  thee.  And  his 
servant  was  healed  in  the  selfsame  hour.

226  Epistles  and  Gospels 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Romans 

(10:1-10) 

XT'E  brethren:  My  heart's  desire  and  prayer  to  God 
■*■    for  Israel  is,  that  they  might  be  saved. 

For  I  bear  them  record  that  they  have  a  zeal  of  God, 
but  not  according  to  knowledge. 

For  they,  being  ignorant  of  God's  righteousness,  and 
going  about  to  establish  their  own  righteousness,  have 
not  submitted  themselves  unto  the  righteousness  of  God. 

For  Christ  is  the  end  of  the  law  for  righteousness  to 
every  one  that  believeth. 

For  Moses  describeth  the  righteousness  which  is  of 
the  law,  That  the  man  which  doeth  those  things  shall 
live  by  them. 

But  the  righteousness  which  is  of  faith  speaketh  on 
this  wise,  Say  not  in  thy  heart.  Who  shall  ascend  into 
heaven?  (that  is,  to  bring  Christ  down  from  above:) 

Or,  Who  shall  descend  into  the  deep?  (that  is,  to 
bring  up  Christ  again  from  the  dead.) 

But  what  saith  it?  The  word  is  nigh  thee,  even  in 
thy  mouth,  and  in  thy  heart:  that  is,  the  word  of  faith, 
which  we  preach : 

That  if  thou  shalt  confess  with  thy  mouth  the  Lord 
Jesus,  and  shalt  believe  in  thine  heart  that  God  hath 
raised  him  from  the  dead,  thou  shalt  be  saved. 

For  with  the  heart  man  believeth  unto  righteousness; 
and  with  the  mouth  confession  is  made  unto  salvation. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (8:28-34;  9:1) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  came  to  the  country  of 
the  Gergasenes,  there  met  him  two  possessed  with 
devils,  coming  out  of  the  tombs,  exceeding  fierce,  so 
that  no  man  might  pass  by  that  way. 

And,  behold,  they  cried  out,  saying,  What  have  we 
to  do  with  thee,  Jesus,  thou  Son  of  God?  art  thou  come 
hither  to  torment  us  before  the  time? 

And  there  was  a  good  way  ofiF  from  them  a  herd  of 
many  swine  feeding. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  227 

So  the  devils  besought  him,  saying,  If  thou  cast  us 
out,  suffer  us  to  go  away  into  the  herd  of  swine. 

And  he  said  unto  them.  Go.  And  when  they  were 
come  out,  they  went  into  the  herd  of  swine:  and,  be- 
hold, the  whole  herd  of  swine  ran  violently  down  a 
steep  place  into  the  sea,  and  perished  in  the  waters. 

And  they  that  kept  them  fled,  and  went  their  ways 
into  the  city,  and  told  every  thing,  and  what  was  be- 
fallen to  the  possessed  of  the  devils. 

And,  behold,  the  whole  city  came  out  to  meet  Jesus: 
and  when  they  saw  him,  they  besought  him  that  he 
would  depart  out  of  their  coasts. 

And  he  entered  into  a  ship,  and  passed  over,  and  came 
into  his  own  city.

"VT'E  brethren:  Having  then  gifts  differing  according 

-■■  to  the  grace  that  is  given  to  us,  whether  prophecy, 

let  us  prophesy  according  to  the  proportion  of  faith: 

Or  ministry,  let  us  wait  on  our  ministering;  or  he 
that  teacheth,  on  teaching; 

Or  he  that  exhorteth,  on  exhortation:  he  that  giveth, 
let  him  do  it  with  simplicity;  he  that  ruleth,  with  dili- 
gence; he  that  showeth  mercy,  with  cheerfulness. 

Let  love  be  without  dissimulation.  Abhor  that 
which  is  evil;  cleave  to  that  which  is  good. 

Be  kindly  affectioned  one  to  another  with  brotherly 
love;  in  honour  preferring  one  another; 

Not  slothful  in  business;  fervent  in  spirit;  serving 
the  Lord: 


228  Epistles  and  Gospels 

Rejoicing  in  hope;  patient  in  tribulation;  continu- 
ing instant  in  prayer; 

Distributing  to  the  necessity  of  saints;  given  to  hos- 
pitality. 

Bless  them  which  persecute  you:  bless,  and  curse 
not. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (9:1-8) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  entered  into  a  ship,  and  passed 
over,  and  came  into  his  ow^n  city. 

And,  behold,  they  brought  to  him  a  man  sick  of  the 
palsy,  lying  on  a  bed:  and  Jesus  seeing  their  faith  said 
unto  the  sick  of  the  palsy;  Son,  be  of  good  cheer,  thy 
sins  be  forgiven  thee. 

And,  behold,  certain  of  the  scribes  said  within  them- 
selves. This  man  blasphemeth. 

And  Jesus  knowing  their  thoughts  said,  Wherefore 
think  ye  evil  in  your  hearts? 

For  whether  is  easier,  to  say,  Thy  sins  be  forgiven 
thee;  or  to  say.  Arise,  and  walk? 

But  that  ye  may  know  that  the  Son  of  man  hath 
power  on  earth  to  forgive  sins,  (then  saith  he  to  the 
sick  of  the  palsy,)  Arise,  take  up  thy  bed,  and  go  unto 
thy  house. 

But  when  the  multitudes  saw  it,  they  marveled,  and 
glorified  God,  which  had  given  such  power  unto  men.

(15:1-7) 

^T'E  brethren:  We  that  are  strong  ought  to  bear  the 
infirmities  of  the  weak,  and  not  to  please  ourselves. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  229 

Let  every  one  of  us  please  his  neighbor  for  his  good 
to  edification. 

For  even  Christ  pleased  not  himself;  but,  as  it  is 
written,  The  reproaches  of  them  that  reproached  thee 
fell  on  me. 

For  w^hatsoever  things  were  written  aforetime  were 
written  for  our  learning,  that  we  through  patience  and 
comfort  of  the  Scriptures  might  have  hope. 

Now  the  God  of  patience  and  consolation  grant  you 
to  be  'likeminded  one  toward  another  according  to 
Christ  Jesus: 

That  ye  may  with  one  mind  and  one  mouth  glorify 
God,  even  the  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 

Wherefore  receive  ye  one  another,  as  Christ  also 
received  us,  to  the  glory  of  God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (9:27-35) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  departed  thence,  two 
blind  men  followed  him,  crying,  and  saying: 
Thou  son  of  David,  have  mercy  on  us. 

And  when  he  was  come  into  the  house,  the  blind 
men  came  to  him:  and  Jesus  saith  unto  them.  Believe 
ye  that  I  am  able  to  do  this?  They  said  unto  him, 
Yea,  Lord. 

Then  touched  he  their  eyes,  saying.  According  to 
your  faith  be  it  unto  you. 

And  their  eyes  were  opened;  and  Jesus  straitly 
charged  them,  saying.  See  that  no  man  know  it. 

But  they,  when  they  were  departed,  spread  abroad 
his  fame  in  all  that  country. 

As  they  went  out,  behold,  they  brought  to  him  a 
dumb  man  possessed  with  a  devil. 

And  when  the  devil  was  cast  out,  the  dumb  spake: 
and  the  multitudes  marveled,  saying.  It  was  never  so 
seen  in  Israel. 

But  the  Pharisees  said,  He  casteth  out  devils  through 
the  prince  of  the  devils. 


230  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  Jesus  went  about  all  the  cities  and  villages, 
teaching  in  their  synagogues,  and  preaching  the  gospel 
of  the  kingdom,  and  healing  every  sickness  and  every 
disease  among  the  people.

The  Lord  will  give  strength  to  his  people.  • 

Bring  to  the  Lord,  O  ye  children  of  God.  ^ 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (1:10-17) 

^/'E  brethren:  I  beseech  you,  by  the  name  of  our  Lord 
-*■  Jesus  Christ,  that  ye  all  speak  the  same  thing,  and 
that  there  be  no  divisions  among  you;  but  that  ye  be 
perfectly  joined  together'  in  the  same  mind  and  in  the 
same  judgment. 

For  it  hath  been  declared  unto  me  of  you,  my  breth- 
ren, by  them  which  are  of  the  house  of  Chloe,  that 
there  are  contentions  among  you. 

Now  this  I  say,  that  every  one  of  you  saith,  I  am  of 
Paul;  and.  I  of  Apollos;  and  I  of  Cephas;  and  I  of 
Christ. 

Is  Christ  divided?  was  Paul  crucified  for  you?  or 
were  ye  baptized  in  the  name  of  Paul? 

I  thank  God  that  I  baptized  none  of  you,  but  Cris- 
pus  and  Gaius; 

Lest  any  should  say  that  I  had  baptized  in  mine 
own  name. 

And  I  baptized  also  the  household  of  Stephanas: 
besides,  I  know  not  whether  I  baptized  any  other. 

For  Christ  sent  me  not  to  baptize,  but  to  preach  the 
gospel :  not  with  wisdom  of  words,  lest  the  cross  of 
Christ  should  be  made  of  none  efifect.

The   Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew   (U:U-22j 

T  that  time:  Jesus  saw  a  great  multitude,  and  was 
moved  with  compassion  toward  them,  and  he 
healed  their  sick. 

And  when  it  was  evening,  his  disciples  came  to  him, 
saying.  This  is  a  desert  place,  and  the  time  is  now  past;- 
send  the  multitude  away,  that  they  may  go  into  the  vil- 
lages, and  buy  themselves  victuals. 

But  Jesus  said  unto  them.  They  need  not  depart; 
give  ye  them  to  eat. 

And  they  say  unto  him.  We  have  here  but  five 
loaves,  and  two  fishes. 

He  said.   Bring  them  hither  to  me. 

And  he  commanded  the  multitude  to  sit  down  on 
the  grass,  and  took  the  five  loaves,  and  the  two  fishes, 
and  looking  up  to  heaven,  he  blessed,  and  brake,  and 
gave  the  loaves  to  his  disciples,  and  the  disciples  to 
the  multitude. 

And  they  did  all  eat,  and  were  filled :  and  they  took 
up  of  the  fragments  that  remained  twelve  baskets  full. 

And  they  that  had  eaten  were  about  five  thousand 
men,  beside  women  and  children. 

And  straiehtw^ay  Jesus  constrained  his  disciples  to 
get  into  a  ship,  and  to  2:0  before  hjm  unto  the  other 
side,  while  he  sent  the  multitudes  away.

^T'E  brethren:  We  are  labourers  together  w^th  God: 
-'■    ye  are  God's  husbandry,  ye  are  God's  building.

tion,  and  another  buildeth  thereon.  But  let  every  man 
take  heed  how  he  buildeth  thereupon. 

For  other  foundation  can  no  man  lay  than  that  is 
laid,  which  is  Jesus  Christ. 

Now  if  any  man  build  upon  this  foundation  gold, 
silver,  precious  stones,  wood,  hay,  stubble; 

Every  man's  work  shall  be  made  manifest:  for  the 
day  shall  declare  it,  because  it  shall  be  revealed  by 
fire;  and  the  fire  shall  try  every  man's  work  of  what 
sort  it  is. 

If  any  man's  work  abide  which  he  hath  built  there- 
upon, he  shall  receive  a  reward. 

If  any  man's  work  shall  be  burned,  he  shall  suffer 
loss:  but  he  himself  shall  be  saved;  yet  so  as  by  fire. 

Know  ye  not  that  ye  are  the  temple  of  God,  and 
that  the  Spirit  of  God  dwelleth  in  you? 

If  any  man  defile  the  temple  of  God,  him  shall  God 
destroy;  for  the  temple  of  God  is  holy,  which  temple 
ye  are. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (14:22-34) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  constrained  his  disciples  to  get 
into  a  ship,  and  to  go  before  him  unto  the  other 
side,  while  he  sent  the  multitude  away. 

And  when  he  had  sent  the  multitudes  away,  he  went 
up  into  a  mountain  apart  to  pray:  and  when  the  eve- 
ning: was  come,  he  was  there  alone. 

But  the  ship  was  now  in  the  midst  of  the  sea,  tossed 
with  waves:  for  the  wind  was  contrary. 

And  in  the  fourth  watch  of  the  night  Jesus  went 
unto  them,  walking  on  the  sea. 

And  when  the  disciples  saw  him  walking  on  the 
sea,  they  were  troubled,  saying.  It  is  a  spirit;  and  they 
cried  out  for  fear. 

But  straightway  Jesus  spake  unto  them,  saying,  Be 
of  good  cheer;  it  is  I;  be  not  afraid. 

And  Peter  answered  him  and  said,  Lord,  if  it  be 
thou,  bid  me  come  unto  thee  on  the  water. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  233 

And  he  said,  Come.  And  when  Peter  was  come 
down  out  of  the  ship,  he  walked  on  the  water,  to  go 
to  Jesus. 

But  when  he  saw  the  wind  boisterous,  he  was  afraid; 
and  beginning  to  sink,  he  cried,  saying,  Lord,  save  me. 

And  immediately  Jesus  stretched  forth  his  hand,  and 
caught  him,  and  said  unto  him,  O  thou  of  little  faith, 
wherefore  didst  thou  doubt? 

And  when  they  were  come  into  the  ship,  the  wind 
ceased. 

Then  they  that  were  in  the  ship  came  and  wor- 
shipped him,  saying.  Of  a  truth  thou  art  the  Son  of 
God. 

And  when  they  were  gone  over,  they  came  into  the 
land  of -Gennesaret.

\7^E  brethren:  God  hath  set  forth  us  the  apostles  last,

We  are  fools  for  Christ's  sake,  but  ye  are  wise  in 
Christ;  we  are  weak,  but  ye  are  strong;  ye  are  hon-

Even  unto  this  present  hour  we  both  hunger,  and 
thirst,  and  are  naked,  and  are  buffeted,  and  have  no 
certain  dwelling  place; 

And  labour,  working  with  our  own  hands:  being  re- 
viled, we  bless;  being  persecuted,  we  suffer  it: 

Being  defamed,  we  intreat:  we  are  made  as  the  filth 
of  the  world,  and  are  the  offscouring  of  all  things  unto

Jesus  I  have  begotten  you  through  the  gospel. 

Wherefore  I  beseech  you,  be  ye  followers  of  me. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (17:14-23) 

AT  that  time:  There  came  to  Christ  a  certain  man, 
kneeling  down  to  him,  and  saying: 

Lord,  have  mercy  on  my  son;  for  he  is  epileptic,  and 
sore  vexed :  for  oft-times  he  f alleth  into  the  fire,  and 
oft  into  the  water. 

And  I  brought  him  to  thy  disciples,  and  they  could 
not  cure  him. 

Then  Jesus  answered  and  said,  O  faithless  and  per- 
verse generation,  how  long  shall  I  be  with  you?  how 
long  shall  I  suffer  you?  bring  him  hither  to  me. 

And  Jesus  rebuked  the  devil;  and  he  departed  out 
of  him:  and  the  child  was  cured  from  that  very  hour. 

Then  came  the  disciples  to  Jesus  apart,  and  said. 
Why  could  not  we  cast  him  out? 

And  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Because  of  your  unbelief: 
for  verily  I  say  unto  you,  If  ye  have  faith  as  a  grain  of 
mustard  seed,  ye  shall  say  unto  this  mountain,  Remove 
hence  to  younder  place;  and  it  shall  remove:  and 
nothing  shall  be  impossible  unto  you. 

Howbeit  this  kind  goeth  not  out  but  by  prayer  and 
fasting. 

And  while  they  abode  in  Galilee,  Tesus  said  unto 
them,  The  Son  of  man  shall  be  betrayed  into  the  hands 
of  men : 

And  they  shall  kill  him,  and  the  third  day  he  shall 
be  raised  again.

Epistles  and  Gospels  235 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (9:2-12) 

^T'E  brethren:  The  seal  of  mine  apostleship  are  ye  in 
^    the  Lord. 

Mine  answer  to  them  that  do  examine  me  is  this: 

Have  we  not  power  to  eat  and  to  drink? 

Have  we  not  power  to  lead  about  a  sister,  a  wife, 
as  well  as  other  apostles,  and  as  the  brethren  of  the 
Lord,  and  Cephas? 

Or  I  only  and  Barnabas,  have  not  we  power  to  for- 
bear working? 

Who  goeth  a  warfare  any  time  at  his  own  charges? 
who  planteth  a  vineyard,  and  eateth  not  of  the  fruit 
thereof?  or  who  feedeth  a  flock,  and  eateth  not  of  the 
milk  of  the  flock? 

Say  I  these  things  as  a  man?  or  saith  not  the  law 
the  same  also? 

For  it  is  written  in  the  law  of  Moses,  Thou  shalt  not 
muzzle  the  mouth  of  the  ox  that  treadeth  out  the  corn. 
Doth  God  take  care  for  oxen? 

Or  saith  he  it  altogether  for  our  sakes?  For  our 
sakes,  no  doubt,  this  is  written:  that  he  that  ploweth 
should  plow  in  hope;  and  that  he  that  thresheth  in 
hope  should  be  partaker  of  his  hope. 

If  we  have  sown  unto  you  spiritual  things,  is  it  a 
great  thing  if  we  shall  reap  your  carnal  things? 

If  others  be  partakers  of  this  power  over  you,  are 
not  we  rather?  Nevertheless  we  have  not  used  this 
power;  but  suffer  all  things,  lest  we  should  hinder  the 
gospel  of  Christ. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (18:23  to  end) 

nPHE   Lord  spake  this   parable:   The  kingdom  of 
heaven  is  likened  unto  a  certain  king,  which  would 
take  account  of  his  servants. 

And  when  he  had  begun  to  reckon,  one  was  brought 
unto  him,  which  owed  him  ten  thousand  talents. 


236  Epistles  and  Gospels 

But  forasmuch  as  he  had  not  to  pay,  his  lord  com- 
manded him  to  be  sold,  and  his  wife,  and  children, 
and  all  that  he  had,  and  payment  to  be  made. 

The  servant  therefore  fell  down,  and  worshipped 
him,  saying.  Lord,  have  patience  with  me,  and  I  will 
pay  thee  all. 

Then  the  lord  of  that  servant  was  moved  with  com- 
passion, and  loosed  him,  and  forgave  him  the  debt. 

But  the  same  servant  went  out,  and  found  one  of  his 
fellow  servants,  which  owed  him  a  hundred  pence: 
and  he  laid  hands  on  him,  and  took  him  by  the  throat, 
saying.  Pay  me  that  thou  owest. 

And  his  fellow  servant  fell  down  at  his  feet,  and 
besought  him,  saying,  Have  patience  with  me,  and  I 
will  pay  thee  all. 

And  he  would  not:  but  went  and  cast  him  into  pri- 
son, till  he  should  pay  the  debt. 

So  when  his  fellow  servants  saw  what  was  done,  they 
were  very  sorry,  and  came  and  told  unto  their  lord  all 
that  was  done. 

Then  his  lord,  after  that  he  had  called  him,  said 
unto  him,  O  thou  wicked  servant,  I  forgave  thee  all 
that  debt,  because  thou  desiredst  me: 

Shouldest  not  thou  also  have  had  compasison  on  thy 
fellow  servant,  even  as  I  had  pity  on  thee? 

And  his  lord  was  wroth,  and  delivered  him  to  the 
tormentors,  till  he  should  pay  all  that  was  due  unto 
him. 

So  likewise  shall  my  heavenly  Father  do  also  unto 
you,  if  ye  from  your  hearts  forgive  not  every  one  his 
brother  their  trespasses.

Epistles  and  Gospels  237 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (15:1-11 ) 

"Y^E  brethren:  I  declare  unto  you  the  gospel  which  I 
"'■  preached  unto  you,  which  also  ye  have  received, 
and  wherein  ye  stand: 

By  which  also  ye  are  saved,  if  ye  keep  in  memory 
what  I  preached  unto  you,  unless  ye  have  believed  in 
vain. 

For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all  that  which  I 
also  received,  how  that  Christ  died  for  our  sins  ac- 
cording to  the  Scriptures; 

And  that  he  was  buried,  and  that  he  rose  again  the 
third  day  according  to  the  Scriptures: 

And  that  he  was  seen  of  Cephas,  then  of  the  twelve: 

After  that,  he  was  seen  of  above  five  hundred  breth- 
ren at  once;  of  whom  the  greater  part  remain  unto  this 
present,  but  some  are  fallen  asleep. 

After  that,  he  was  seen  of  James;  then  of  all  the 
apostles. 

And  last  of  all  he  was  seen  of  me  also,  as  of  one 
born  out  of  due  time. 

For  I  am  the  least  of  the  apostles,  that  am  not  meet 
to  be  called  an  apostle,  because  I  persecuted  the  church 
of  God. 

But  bv  the  g:race  of  God  I  am  what  I  am:  and  his 
erace  which  was  bestowed  upon  me  was  not  in  vain; 
hnf  T  laboured  more  abundantly  than  they  all:  yet  not 
I.  but  the  ,G:race  of  God  which  was  with  me. 

Therefore  whether  it  were  I  or  they,  so  we  preached, 
and  so  ye  believed. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (19:16-26) 
AT  that  time:  A  young  man  came  kneeling  down  to 
Jesus   and   said:   Good   Master  what  good   thing 
shall  I  do,  that  T  may  have  eternal  life? 

And  he  said  unto  Jbim,  Why  callest  thou  me  good? 
there  is  none  good  but  one,  that  is,  God:  but  if  thou 
wilt  enter  into  life,  keep  the  commandments. 


238  Epistles  and  Gospels 

He  saith  unto  him,  Which?  Jesus  said,  Thou  shalt 
do  no  murder.  Thou  shalt  not  commit  adultery.  Thou 
shalt  not  steal.  Thou  shalt  not  bear  false  witness, 

Honour  thy  father  and  thy  mother:  and.  Thou  shalt 
love  thy  neighbour  as  thyself. 

The  young  man  saith  unto  him.  All  these  things 
have  I  kept  from  my  youth  up:  what  lack  I  yet? 

Jesus  said  unto  him.  If  thou  wilt  be  perfect,  go  and 
sell  that  thou  hast,  and  give  to  the  poor,  and  thou  shalt 
have  treasure  in  heaven:  and  come  and  follow  me. 

But  when  the  young  man  heard  that  saying,  he  went 
away  sorrowful:  for  he  had  great  possessions. 

Then  said  Jesus  unto  his  disciples,  Verily  I  say 
unto  you.  That  a  rich  man  shall  hardly  enter  into  the 
kingdom  of  heaven. 

And  again  I  say  unto  you,  It  is  easier  for  a  camel  to 
go  through  the  eye  of  a  needle,  than  for  a  rich  man  to 
enter  into  the  kingdom  of  God. 

When  his  disci oles  heard  it,  they  were  exceedingly 
amazed,  saying,  Who  then  can  be  saved? 

But  Jesus  beheld  them,  and  said  unto  them,  With 
men  this  is  impossible;  but  with  God  all  things  are 
possible.

Let  all  your  things  be  done  with  charity. 

I  beseech  you,  brethren,  (ye  know  the  house  of 
Stephanas,  that  it  is  the  firstfruits  of  Achaia,  and  that

Epistles  and  Gospels  239 

That  ye  submit  yourselves  unto  such,  and  to  every

I  am  glad  of  the  coming  of  Stephanas  and  Fortunatus 
and  Achaicus:  for  that  which  was  lacking  on  your  part 
they  have  supplied. 

For  they  have  refreshed  my  spirit  and  yours:  there- 
fore acknowledge  ye  them  that  are  such. 

The  churches  of  Asia  salute  you.  Aquila  and  Pris- 
cilla  salute  you  much  in  the  Lord,  with  the  church  that 
is  in  their  house. 

All  the  brethren  greet  you.  Greet  ye  one  another

If  any  man  love  not  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  let  him

My  love  be  with  you  all  in  Christ  Jesus.    Amen. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (21:33-42) 

npHE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  There  was  a  man  a 
^  householder,  who  planted  a  vineyard,  and  made  a 
hedge  round  about  it,  and  dug  a  winepress  in  it,  and 
built  a  tower,  and  let  it  out  to  husbandmen  and  went 
into  a  strange  country. 

And  when  the  time  of  the  fruit  drew  near,  he  sent  his 
servants  to  the  husbandmen,  that  they  might  receive  the 
fruits  of  it. 

And  the  husbandmen  took  his  servants,  and  beat  one, 
and  killed  another,  and  stoned  another. 

Again,  he  sent  other  servants  more  than  the  first:  and 
they  did  unto  them  likewise. 

But  last  of  all  he  sent  unto  them  his  son,  saying.  They 
will  reverence  my  son. 

But  when  the  husbandmen  saw  the  son,  they  said 
among  themselves,  This  is  the  heir;  come,  let  us  kill 
him,  and  let  us  seize  on  his  inheritance. 

And  they  caught  him,  and  cast  him  out  of  the  vine- 
yard, and  slew  him. 


240  Epistles  and  Gospels 

When  the  lord  therefore  of  the  vineyard  cometh, 
what  will  he  do  unto  those  husbandmen? 

They  say  unto  him,  He  will  miserably  destroy  those 
wicked  men,  and  will  let  out  his  vineyard  unto  other 
husbandmen,  which  shall  render  him  the  fruits  in  their 
seasons. 

Jesus  saith  unto  them,  Did  ye  never  read  in  the  Scrip- 
tures, The  stone  which  the  builders  rejected,  the  same  is 
become  the  head  of  the  corner:  this  is  the  Lord's  doing, 
and  it  is  marvellous  in  our  eyes?

Thou  O  Lord  wilt  preserve  us  and  keep  us  from  this

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (1:21  to  end;  2:1-4) 

XT'E  brethren:  He  which  stablisheth  us  with  you  in 
-*•  Christ,  and  hath  anointed  us,  is  God: 

Who  hath  also  sealed  us,  and  given  the  earnest  of 
the  Spirit  in  our  hearts. 

Moreover  I  call  God  for  a  record  upon  my  soul,  that 
to  spare  you  I  came  not  as  yet  unto  Corinth. 

Not  for  that  we  have  dominion  over  your  faith,  but 
are  helpers  of  your  joy:  for  by  faith  ye  stand. 

But  I  determined  this  with  myself,  that  I  would  not 
come  again  to  you  in  heaviness. 

For  if  I  make  you  sorry,  who  is  he  then  that  maketh 
me  glad,  but  the  same  which  is  made  sorry  by  me? 

And  T  wrote  this  same  unto  you,  lest  when  I  came, 
I  should  have  sorrow  from  them  of  whom  I  ought  to 
rejoice;  having  confidence  in  you  all,  that  my  joy  is  the 
joy  of  you  all. 

For  out  of  much  affliction  and  anguish  of  heart  I 
wrote  unto  you  with  many  tears;  not  that  ye  should  be 


Epistles  and  Gospels  241 

grieved,  but  that  ye  might  know  the  love  which  I  have 
more  abundantly  unto  you. 

The  Gospel:  from  St,  Matthew  (22:2-14) 

'  I  ""HE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  The  kingdom  of  hea- 
ven  is  like  unto  a  certain  king,  which  made  a  mar- 
riage for  his  son. 

And  sent  forth  his  servants  to  call  them  that  were 
bidden  to  the  wedding:  and  they  would  not  come. 

Again,  he  sent  forth  other  servants,  saying.  Tell  them 
which  are  bidden,  Behold,  I  have  prepared  my  dinner: 
my  oxen  and  my  fatlings  are  killed,  and  all  things  are 
ready:  come  unto  the  marriage. 

But  they  made  light  of  it,  and  went  their  ways,  one 
to  his  farm,  another  to  his  merchandise: 

And  the  remnant  took  his  servants,  and  entreated 
them  spitefully,  and  slew  them. 

But  when  the  king  heard  thereof,  he  was  wroth :  and 
he  sent  forth  his  armies,  and  destroyed  those  murderers, 
and  burned  up  their  city. 

Then  saith  he  to  his  servants.  The  wedding  is  ready, 
but  they  which  were  bidden  were  not  worthy. 

Go  ye  therefore  into  the  highways,  and  as  many  as 
ye  shall  find,  bid  to  the  marriage. 

So  those  servants  went  out  into  the  highways,  and 
gathered  together  all  as  many  as  they  found,  both  bad 
and  good:  and  the  wedding  was  furnished  with  guests. 

And  when  the  king  came  in  to  see  the  guests,  he  saw 
there  a  man  which  had  not  on  a  wedding  garment: 

And  he  saith  unto  him.  Friend,  how  camest  thou  in 
hither  not  having  a  wedding  garment?  And  he  was 
speechless. 

Then  said  the  king  to  the  servants.  Bind  him  hand 
and  foot,  and  take  him  away,  and  cast  him  into  outer 
darkness;  there  shall  be  weeping  and  gnashing  of  teeth. 

For  many  are  called,  but  few  are  chosen,

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

Save,  O  Lord,  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance. 
Unto  thee  I  cry,  Q  Lord,  O  my  God. 

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (4:6-15) 

VT'E  brethren:  For  God,  who  commanded  the  light  to 
-"■  shine  out  of  darkness,  hath  shined  in  our  hearts,  to 
give  the  light  of  the  knowledge  of  the  glory  of  God  in 
the  face  of  Jesus  Christ. 

But  we  have  this  treasure  in  earthen  vessels,  that  the 
excellency  of  the  power  may  be  of  God,  and  not  of  us. 

We  are  troubled  on  every  side,  yet  not  distressed;  we 
are  perplexed,  but  not  in  despair; 

Persecuted,  but  not  forsaken;  cast  down,  but  not 
destroyed ; 

Always  bearing  about  in  the  body  the  dying  of  the 
Lord  Jesus,  that  the  life  also  of  Jesus  might  be  made 
manifest  in  our  body. 

For  we  which  live  are  always  delivered  unto  death 
for  Jesus'  sake,  that  the  life  also  of  Jesus  might  be  made 
manifest  in  our  mortal  flesh. 

So  then  death  worketh  in  us,  but  life  in  you. 

We  having  the  same  spirit  of  faith,  according  as  it  is 
written,  I  believed,  and  therefore  have  I  spoken;  we 
also  believe,  and  therefore  speak; 

Knowing  that  he  which  raised  up  the  Lord  Jesus  shall 
raise  up  us  also  by  Jesus,  and  shall  present  us  with  you. 

For  all  things  are  for  your  sakes,  that  the  abundant 
erace  might  through  the  thanksgiving  of  many  redound 
to  the  glory  of  God. 


The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (22:35  to  end) 

that  time:   A  certain  lawyer  came   and   asked 
esus,  tempting  him,  saying: 
Master,  which  is  the  great  commandment  in  the  law? 


A^, 


Epistles  and  Gospels  243 

Jesus  said  unto  him,  Thou  shalt  love  the  Lord  thy 
God  with  all  thy  heart,  and  with  all  thy  soul,  and  with 
all  thy  mind. 

This  is  the  first  and  great  commandment. 

And  the  second  is  like  unto  it.  Thou  shalt  love  thy 
neighbour  as  thyself. 

On  these  two  commandments  hang  all  the  law  and 
the  prophets. 

While  the  Pharisees  were  gathered  together,  Jesus 
asked  them. 

Saying,  What  think  ye  of  Christ?  whose  son  is  he? 
They  say  unto  him,  The  son  of  David. 

He  saith  unto  them.  How  then  doth  David  in  spirit 
call  him  Lord,  saying, 

The  Lord  said  unto  my  Lord,  Sit  thou  on  my  right 
hand,  till  I  make  thine  enemies  thy  footstool? 

If  David  then  call  him  Lord,  how  is  he  his  son? 

And  no  man  was  able  to  answer  him  a  word,  neither 
durst  any  man  from  that  day  forth  ask  him  any  more 
questions.

In  stripes,  in  imprisonments,  in  tumults,  in  labours, 
in  watchings,  in  fastings; 

By  pureness,  by  knowledge^  by  longsufifering,  by 
kindness,  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  by  love  unfeigned. 

By  the  word  of  truth,  by  the  power  of  God,  by  the 
armour  of  righteousness  on  the  right  hand  and  on  the 
left, 

By  honour  and  dishonour,  by  evil  report  and  good 
report:  as  deceivers,  and  yet  true; 

As  unknown,  and  yet  well  known;  as  dying,  and, 
behold,  we  live;  as  chastened,  and  not  killed; 

As  sorrowful,  yet  always  rejoicing;  as  poor,  yet  mak- 
ing many  rich;  as  having  nothing,  and  yet  possessing 
all  things. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (25:14-30;  St.  Luke 

8:8) 

nPHE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  A  man  travelling 
called  his  own  servants,  and  delivered  unto  them  his 
goods. 

And  unto  one  he  gave  five  talents,  to  another  two,  and 
to  another  one;  to  every  man  according  to  his  several 
ability;  and  straightway  took  his  journey. 

Then  he  that  had  received  the  five  talents  went  and 
traded  with  the  same,  and  made  them  other  five  talents. 

And  likewise  he  that  had  received  two,  he  also  gained 
other  two. 

But  he  that  had  received  one  went  and  digged  in  the 
earth,  and  hid  his  lord's  money. 

After  a  long  time  the  lord  of  those  servants  cometh, 
and  reckoneth  with  them. 

And  so  he  that  had  received  five  talents  came  and 
brought  other  five  talents,  saying.  Lord,  thou  deliver- 
edst  unto  me  five  talents:  behold,  I  have  gained  beside 
them  five  talents  more. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  245 

His  lord  said  unto  him,  Well  done,  thou  good  and 
faithful  servant:  thou  hast  been  faithful  over  a  few 
things,  I  will  make  thee  ruler  over  many  things:  enter 
thou  into  the  joy  of  thy  lord. 

He  also  that  had  received  two  talents  came  and  said, 
Lord,  thou  deliveredst  unto  me  two  talents :  behold,  I 
have  gained  two  other  talents  beside  them. 

His  lord  said  unto  him.  Well  done,  good  and  faithful 
servant;  thou  hast  been  faithful  over  a  few  things,  I 
will  make  thee  ruler  over  many  things:  enter  thou  into 
the  joy  of  thy  lord. 

Then  he  w^hich  had  received  the  one  talent  came  and 
said,  Lord,  I  knew  thee  that  thou  art  an  hard  man,  reap- 
ing where  thou  hast  not  sown,  and  gathering  where 
thou  hast  not  strawed : 

And  I  was  afraid,  and  went  and  hid  thy  talent  in  the 
earth:  lo,  there  thou  hast  that  is  thine. 

His  lord  answered  and  said  unto  him.  Thou  wicked 
and  slothful  servant,  thou  knewest  that  I  reap  where  I 
sowed  not,  and  gather  where  I  have  not  strawed: 

Thou  oughtest  therefore  to  have  put  my  money  to  the 
exchangers,  and  then  at  my  coming  I  should  have  re- 
ceived mine  own  with  usury. 

Take  therefore  the  talent  from  him,  and  give  it  unto 
him  which  hath  ten  talents. 

For  unto  every  one  that  hath  shall  be  given,  and  he 
shall  have  abundance:  but  from  him  that  hath  not  shall 
be  taken  away  even  that  which  he  hath. 

And  cast  ye  the  unprofitable  servant  into  outer  dark- 
ness:  there  shall  be  weeping  and  gnashing  of  teeth. 

And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  he  cried.  He  that 
hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear.

AT  that  time:  Jesus  departed  into  the  coasts  of  Tyre 
and  Sidon. 

And,  behold,  a  woman  of  Canaan  came  out  of  the 
same  coasts,  and  cried  unto  him,  saving,  Have  mercy 
on  me,  O  Lord,  thou  Son  of  David;  my  daughter  is 
grievously  vexed  with  a  devil. 

But  he  answered  her  not  a  word.  And  his  disciples 
came  and  besought  him,  saying:.  Send  her  away;  for 
she  crieth  after  us. 

But  he  answered  and  said,  I  am  not  sent  but  unto  the 
lost  sheep  of  the  house  of  Israel. 

Then  came  she  and  worshipped  him,  saying,  Lord, 
help  me. 

But  he  answered  and  said.  It  is  not  meet  to  take  the 
children's  bread,  and  to  cast  it  to  dogs. 

And  she  said,  Truth,  Lord:  yet  the  dogs  eat  of  the 
crumbs  which  fall  from  their  masters'  table. 

Then  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  her,  O  woman, 
great  is  thy  faith  :  be  it  unto  thee  even  as  thou  wilt.  And 
her  daughter  was  made  whole  from  that  very  hour.

^  -^  things  I  will  that  thou  affirm  constantly,  that  they 
which  have  believed  in  God  might  be  careful  to  main- 
tain good  works.  These  things  are  good  and  profitable 
unto  men. 

But  avoid  foolish  questions,  and  genealogies,  and  con- 
tentions, and  strivings  about  the  law;  for  they  are  un- 
profitable and  vain. 

A  man  that  is  an  heretic,  after  the  first  and  second 
admonition,  reject; 

Knowing  that  he  that  is  such  is  subverted,  and  sin- 
neth,  being  condemned  of  himeslf. 

When  I  shall  send  Artemas  unto  thee,  or  Tychicus, 
be  diligent  to  come  unto  me  to  Nicopolis:  for  I  have 
determined  there  to  winter. 

Bring  Zenas  the  lawyer  and  Apollos  on  their  journey 
diligently,  that  nothing  be  wanting  unto  them. 

And  let  ours  also  learn  to  maintain  good  works  for 
necessary  uses,  that  they  be  not  unfruitful. 

All  that  are  with  me  salute  thee.  Greet  them  that 
love  us  in  the  faith.    Grace  be  with  you  all.    Amen. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (5:14-19) 
nPHE  Lord  saith  to  his  disciples:  Ye  are  the  light  of 
the  world.     A  city  that  is  set  on  an  hill  cannot  be 
hid. 

Neither  do  men  light  a  candle,  and  put  it  under  a 
bushel,  but  on  a  candlestick;  and  it  giveth  light  unto  all 
that  are  in  the  house. 


24^  Epistles  and  Gospels 

Let  your  light  so  shine  before  men,  that  they  may 
see  your  good  works,  and  glorify  your  Father  which  is 
in  heaven. 

Think  not  that  I  am  come  to  destroy  the  law,  or  the 
prophets:  I  am  not  come  to  destroy,  but  to  fulfil. 

For  verily  I  say  unto  you.  Till  heaven  and  earth  pass, 
one  jot  or  one  tittle  shall  in  no  wise  pass  from  the  law, 
till  all  be  fulfilled. 

Whosoever  therefore  shall  break  one  of  these  least 
commandments,  and  shall  teach  men  so,  he  shall  be 
called  the  least  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven:  but  whoso- 
ever shall  do  and  teach  them,  the  same  shall  be  called 
great  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

The  Sunday  before  the  Elevation  of  the  Cross 

From  Sept.  7th  to  13th 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

Save,  O  Lord,  thy  people  and  bless  thine  inheritance. 
Unto  thee  will  I  cry,  O  Lord,  my  God. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St,  Paul  to  the  Galatians 
(6:11  to  end) 

'^T'E  brethren:  See  what  a  letter  I  have  written  unto 
you  with  mine  own  hand. 

As  many  as  desire  to  make  a  fair  show  in  the  flesh, 
they  constrain  you  to  be  circumcised;  only  lest  they 
should  sufifer  persecution  for  the  cross  of  Christ. 

For  neither  they  themselves  who  are  circumcised 
keep  the  law;  but  desire  to  have  you  circumcised,  that 
they  may  glory  in  your  flesh. 

But  God  forbid  that  I  should  glory,  save  in  the  cross 
of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  by  whom  the  world  is  cruci- 
fied unto  me,  and  I  unto  the  world. 

For  in  Christ  Jesus  neither  circumcision  availeth  any 
thing,  nor  uncircumcision,  but  a  new  creature. 

And  as  many  as  walk  according  to  this  rule,  peace 
be  on  them,  and  mercy,  and  upon  the  Israel  of  God. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  249 

From  henceforth  let  no  man  trouble  me:  for  I  bear 
in  my  body  the  marks  of  the  Lord  Jesus. 

Brethren,  the  grace  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  be 
with  your  spirit.    Amen. 

The  Gospel:  from  St,  John  (3:13-17) 
'THHE    Lord    saith :    No    man    hath    ascended    into 
heaven,  but  he  that  came  down  from  heaven,  even 
the  Son  of  man  which  is  in  heaven. 

And  as  Moses  lifted  up  the  serpent  in  the  wilderness, 
even  so  must  the  Son  of  man  be  lifted  up: 

That  whosoever  believeth  in  him  should  not  perish, 
but  have  eternal  life. 

For  God  so  loved  the  world,  that  he  gave  his  only 
begotten  Son,  that  whosoever  believeth  in  him  should 
not  perish,  but  have  everlasting  life. 

For  God  sent  not  his  Son  into  the  world  to  condemn 
the  world;  but  that  the  world  through  him  might  be 
saved. 

The  Sunday  after  the  Elevation  of  the  Cross 

Sept.  15th  to  21st 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

How  great  are  thy  works,  O  Lord,  Thou  hast  made 
all  things  in  wisdom. 

Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Galatians 

(2:16-20) 

VT'E  brethren:  Knowing  that  a  man  is  not  justified  by 
^  the  works  of  the  law,  but  by  the  faith  of  Jesus 
Christ,  even  we  have  believed  in  Jesus  Christ,  that  we 
might  be  justified  by  the  faith  of  Christ,  and  not  by 
the  work  of  the  law:  for  by  the  works  of  the  law  shall 
no  flesh  be  justified. 


250  Epistles  and  Gospels 

But  if,  while  we  seek  to  be  justified  by  Christ,  we 
ourselves  also  are  found  sinners,  is  therefore  Christ 
the  minister  of  sin?     God  forbid. 

For  if  I  build  again  the  things  which  I  destroyed, 
I  make  myself  a  transgressor. 

For  I  through  the  law  am  dead  to  the  law,  that  I 
might  live  unto  God. 

I  am  crucified  with  Christ:  nevertheless  I  live;  yet 
not  I,  but  Christ  liveth  in  me:  and  the  life  which  I 
now  live  in  the  flesh  I  live  by  the  faith  of  the  Son  of 
God,  who  loved  me,  and  gave  himself  for  me. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (8:34  to  end;  9:1) 

T~^HE  Lord  saith :  Whosoever  will  come  after  me, 
let  him  deny  himself,  and  take  up  his  cross,  and 
follow  me. 

For  whosoever  will  save  his  life  shall  lose  it;  but 
whosoever  shall  lose  his  life  for  my  sake  and  the  gos- 
pel's, the  same  shall  save  it. 

For  what  shall  it  profit  a  man,  if  he  shall  gain  the 
whole  world,  and  lose  his  own  soul? 

Or  what  shall  a  man  give  in  exchange  for  his  soul? 

Whosoever  therefore  shall  be  ashamed  of  me  and 
of  my  words,  in  this  adulterous  and  sinful  generation, 
of  him  also  shall  the  Son  of  man  be  ashamed,  when  he 
Cometh  in  the  glory  of  his  Father  with  the  holy  angels. 

And  he  said  unto  them.  Verily  I  say  unto  you,  That 
there  be  some  of  them  that  stand  here,  which  shall  not 
taste  of  death,  till  they  have  seen  the  kingdom  of  God 
come  with  power. 

Eighteenth  Sunday 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  First  Tone 

Let  thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  be  upon  us.

Epistles  and  Gospels  251 

Section  from   the  Second  Epistle   of  St.  Paul  to   the 
Corinthians  (9:6-11) 

'Y^E  brethren:  He  which  soweth  sparingly  shall  reap 
^  also  sparingly;  and  he  which  soweth  bountifully 
shall  reap  also  bountifully. 

Every  man  according  as  he  purposeth  in  his  heart, 
so  let  him  give;  not  grudgingly,  or  of  necessity:  for 
God  loveth  a  cheerful  giver. 

And  God  is  able  to  make  all  grace  abound  toward 
you;  that  ye,  always  having  all  sufficiency  in  all  things, 
may  abound  to  every  good  work: 

(As  it  is  written.  He  hath  dispersed  abroad;  he 
hath  given  to  the  poor:  his  righteousness  remaineth  for 
ever. 

Now  he  that  ministereth  seed  to  the  sower  both  min- 
ister bread  for  your  food,  and  multiply  your  seed  sown, 
and  increase  the  fruits  of  your  righteousness;) 

Being  enriched  in  every  thing  to  all  bountifulness, 
which  causeth  through  us  thanksgiving  to  God. 

The  Gospel :  from  St.  Luke  (5 :1-11 ) 

A  T  that  time :  As  the  Lord  stood  by  the  lake  of  Gene- 

^  saret,  he  saw  two  ships  standing  by  the  lake:  but 
the  fishermen  were  gone  out  of  them,  and  were  wash- 
ing their  nets. 

And  he  entered  into  one  of  the  ships,  which  was 
Simon's,  and  prayed  him  that  he  would  thrust  out  a 
little  from  the  land.  And  he  sat  down,  and  taught  the 
people  out  of  the  ship. 

Now  when  he  had  left  speaking,  he  said  unto  Simon, 
Launch  out  into  the  deep,  and  let  down  your  nets  for 
a  draught. 

And  Simon  answering  said  unto  him,  Master,  we 
have  toiled  all  the  night,  and  have  taken  nothing:  nev- 
ertheless at  thy  word  I  will  let  down  the  net. 

And  when  they  had  this  done,  they  inclosed  a  great 
multitude  of  fishes:  and  their  net  brake. 


252  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  they  beckoned  unto  their  partners,  which  were 
in  the  other  ship,  that  they  should  come  and  help  them. 
And  they  came,  and  filled  both  the  ships,  so  that  they 
began  to  sink. 

When  Simon  Peter  saw  it,  he  fell  down  at  Jesus' 
knees,  saying.  Depart  from  me;  for  I  am  a  sinful  man, 

0  Lord. 

For  he  was  astonished,  and  all  that  were  with  him, 
at  the  draught  of  the  fishes  which  they  had  taken. 

And  so  was  also  James,  and  John,  the  sons  of  Zebe- 
dee,  which  were  partners  with  Simon.  And  Jesus  said 
unto  Simon,  Fear  not;  from  henceforth  thou  shalt  catch 
men. 

And  when  they  had  brought  their  ships  to  land,  they 
forsook  all,  and  followed  him. 

Nineteenth  Sunday 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Second  Tone 

The  Lord  is  my  strength  and  my  praise. 
The  Lord  chastising  hath  chastised  me. 

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (11 :31  to  end;  1.2:1-9) 

\7E  brethren:  The  God  and  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus 
-■■    Christ  which  is  blessed  forevermore,  knoweth  that 

1  lie  not. 

In  Damascus  the  governor  under  Aretas  the  king 
kept  the  city  of  the  Damascenes  with  a  garrison,  desir- 
ous to  apprehend  me: 

And  through  a  window  in  a  basket  was  I  let  down 
by  the  wall,  and  escaped  his  hands. 

It  is  not  expedient  for  me  doubtless  to  glory.  I  will 
come  to  visions  and  revelations  of  the  Lord. 

I  knew  a  man  in  Christ  above  fourteen  years  ago, 
(whether  in  the  body,  I  cannot  tell;  or  whether  out  of 
the  body,  I  cannot  tell:  God  knoweth;)  such  an  one 
caught  up  to  the  third  heaven. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  253 

And  I  knew  such  a  man,  (whether  in  the  body,  or 
out  of  the  body,  I  cannot  tell:  God  knoweth;) 

How  that  he  was  caught  up  into  paradise,  and  heard 
unspeakable  words,  which  it  is  not  lawful  for  a  man 
to  utter. 

Of  such  an  one  will  I  glory:  yet  of  myself  I  will  not 
glory,  but  in  mine  infirmities. 

For  though  I  would  desire  to  glory,  I  shall  not  be  a 
fool;  for  I  will  say  the  truth:  but  now  I  forbear,  lest 
any  man  should  think  of  me  above  that  which  he  seeth 
me  to  be,  or  that  he  heareth  of  me. 

And  lest  I  should  be  exalted  above  measure  through 
the  abundance  of  the  revelations,  there  was  given  to  me 
a  thorn  in  the  flesh,  the  messenger  of  Satan  to  buffet 
me,  lest  I  should  be  exalted  above  measure. 

For  this  thing  I  besought  the  Lord  thrice,  that  it 
might  depart  from  me. 

And  he  said  unto  me,  My  grace  is  sufficient  for  thee: 
for  my  strength  is  made  perfect  in  weakness.  Most 
gladly  therefore  will  I  rather  glory  in  my  infirmities, 
that  the  power  of  Christ  may  rest  upon  me. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (6:31-36) 

'  I  ^HE  Lord  saith :  As  ye  would  that  men  should  do 
to  you,  do  ye  also  to  them  likewise. 

For  if  ye  love  them  which  love  you,  what  thank  have 
ye?  for  sinners  also  love  those  that  love  them. 

And  if  ye  do  good  to  them  which  do  good  to  you, 
what  thank  have  ye?  for  sinners  also  do  even  the  same. 

And  if  ye  lend  to  them  of  whom  ye  hope  to  receive, 
what  thank  have  ye?  for  sinners  also  lend  to  sinners, 
to  receive  as  much  again. 

But  love  ye  your  enemies,  and  do  good,  and  lend, 
hoping  for  nothing  again;  and  your  reward  shall  be 
great,  and  ye  shall  be  the  children  of  the  Highest:  for 
he  is  kind  unto  the  unthankful  and  to  the  evil. 

Be  ye  therefore  merciful,  as  your  Father  also  is  mer- 
ciful.

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Third  Tone 

Sing  praises  to  our  God,  sing  praises. 
O  clap  your  hands,  all  ye  nations. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St,  Paul  to  the  Galatians 

(1:11-19) 

X/'E  brethren :  I  certify  you,  that  the  gospel  which  was 
-■-    preached  of  me  is  not  after  man. 

For  I  neither  received  it  of  man,  neither  was  I  taught 
it,  but  by  the  revelation  of  Jesus  Christ. 

For  ye  have  heard  of  my  conversation  in  time  past 
in  the  Jews'  religion,  how  that  beyond  measure  I  perse- 
cuted the  church  of  God  and  wasted  it: 

And  profited  in  the  Jews'  religion  above  many  my 
equals  in  mine  own  nation,  being  more  exceedingly 
zealous  of  the  traditions  of  my  fathers. 

But  when  it  pleased  God,  who  separated  me  from 
my  mother's  womb,  and  called  me  by  his  grace. 

To  reveal  his  Son  in  me,  that  I  might  preach  him 
among  the  heathen;  immediately  I  conferred  not  with 
flesh  and  blood  : 

Neither  went  I  up  to  Jerusalem  to  them  which  were 
apostles  before  me;  but  I  went  into  Arabia',  and  re- 
turned again  unto  Damascus. 

Then  after  three  years  I  went  up  to  Jerusalem  to  see 
Peter,  and  abode  with  him  fifteen  days. 

But  other  of  the  apostles  saw  I  none,  save  James  and 
the  Lord's  brother. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (7:11-16) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  was  going  into  a  city  called 
^^Nain,  and  many  of  his  disciples  went  with  him,  and 
much  people. 

Now  \vhen  he  came  nigh  to  the  gate  of  the  city,  be- 
hold, there  was  a  dead  man  carried  out,  the  only  son  of 


Epistles  and   Gospels  255 

his  mother,  and  she  was  a  widow:  and  much  people  of 
the  city  was  with  her. 

And  when  the  Lord  saw  her,  he  had  compassion  on 
her,  and  said  unto  her.  Weep  not. 

And  he  came  and  touched  the  bier:  and  they  that 
bare  him  stood  still.  And  he  said.  Young  man,  I  say 
unto  thee.  Arise. 

And  he  that  was  dead  sat  up,  and  began  to  speak. 
And  he  delivered  him  to  his  mother. 

And  there  came  a  fear  on  all :  and  they  glorified  God, 
saying.  That  a  great  prophet  is  risen  up  among  us;  and. 
That  God  hath  visited  his  people.

How  great  are  thy  works,  O  Lord!

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Galatians 

(2:16-20) 

'^T^E  brethren:  Knowing  that  a  man  is  not  justified  by 
^    the  works  of  the  law,  etc,  (p.  249). 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  8:5-15) 

'  I  ^HE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  A  sower  went  out  to 
sow  his  seed  :  and  as  he  sowed,  some  fell  by  the  way- 
side; and  it  was  trodden  down,  and  the  fowls  of  the  air 
devoured  it. 

And  some  fell  upon  a  rock;  and  as  soon  as  it  was 
sprung  up,  it  withered  away,  because  it  lacked  moisture. 

And  some  fell  among  thorns;  and  the  thorns  sprang 
up  with  it,  and  choked  it.  And  other  fell  on  good 
ground,  and  sprang  up,  and  bare  fruit  an  hundredfold. 

And  his  disciples  asked  him,  saying.  What  might  this 
parable  be?  And  he  said,  Unto  you  it  is  given  to  know 
the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of  God:  but  to  others  in 


256  Epistles  and  Gospels 

parables;  that  seeing  they  might  not  see,  and  hearing 
they  might  not  understand. 

Now  the  parable  is  this:  The  seed  is  the  word  of 
God. 

Those  by  the  way  side  are  they  that  hear;  then  com- 
eth  the  devil,  and  taketh  away  the  word  out  of  their 
hearts,  lest  they  should  believe  and  be  saved. 

They  on  the  rock  are  they,  which,  when  they  hear, 
receive  the  word  with  joy;  and  these  have  no  root, 
which  for  a  while  believe,  and  in  time  of  temptation 
fall  away. 

And  that  which  fell  among  thorns  are  they,  which, 
when  they  have  heard,  go  forth,  and  are  choked  with 
cares  and  riches  and  pleasures  of  this  life,  and  bring  no 
fruit  to  perfection. 

But  that  on  the  good  ground  are  they,  which  in  an 
honest  and  good  heart,  having  heard  the  word,  keep 
it,  and  bring  forth  fruit  with  patience.  And  when  he 
had  said  these  things,  he  cried.  He  that  hath  ears  to 
hear,  let  him  hear.

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (16:19  to  end) 

nPHE  Lord  saith :  There  was  a  certain  rich  man, 
which  was  clothed  in  purple  and  fine  linen,  and 
fared  sumptuously  every  day: 


I 


Epistles  and  Gospels  257 

And  there  was  a,  certain  beggar  named  Lazarus, 
which  was  laid  at  his  gate,  full  of  sores. 

And  desiring  to  be  fed  with  the  crumbs  which  fell 
from  the  rich  man's  table :  moreover  the  dogs  came  and 
licked  his  sores. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that  the  beggar  died,  and  was 
carried  by  the  angels  into  Abraham's  bosom:  the  rich 
man  also  died,  and  was  buried; 

And  in  hell  he  lifted  up  his  eyes,  being  in  torments, 
and  seeth  Abraham  afar  oflf,  and  Lazarus  in  his  bosom. 

And  he  cried  and  said.  Father  Abraham,  have  mercy 
on  me,  and  send  Lazarus,  that  he  may  dip  the  tip  of 
his  finger  in  water,  and  cool  my  tongue;  for  I  am  tor- 
mented in  this  flame. 

But  Abraham  said.  Son,  remember  that  thou  in  thy 
lifetime  receivedst  thy  good  things,  and  likewise  Laza- 
rus evil  things:  but  now  he  is  comforted,  and  thou  art 
tormented. 

And  beside  all  this,  between  us  and  you  there  is  a 
great  gulf  fixed :  so  that  they  which  would  pass  from 
hence  to  you  cannot;  neither  can  they  pass  to  us,  that 
would  come  from  thence. 

Then  he  said,  I  pray  thee  therefore,  father,  that  thou 
wouldest  send  him  to  my  father's  house: 

For  I  have  five  brethren;  that  he  may  testify  unto 
them,  lest  they  also  come  into  this  place  of  torment. 

Abraham  saith  unto  him.  They  have  Moses  and  the 
prophets;  let  them  hear  them. 

And  he  said,  Nay,  father  Abraham:  but  if  one  went 
unto  them  from  the  dead,  they  will  repent. 

And  he  said  unto  him,  If  they  hear  not  Moses  and  the 
prophets,  neither  will  they  be  persuaded,  though  one 
rose  from  the  dead.

"XT'E  brethren:  God    (who  is  rich  in  mercy)   for  his 
■*■    great  love  wherewith  he  loved  us; 

Even  when  we  were  dead  in  sins,  hath  quickened  us

And  hath  raised  us  up  together,  and  made  us  sit  to-

through  Christ  Jesus. 

For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through  faith;  and  that  not 
of  yourselves:  it  is  the  gift  of  God: 

Not  of  works,  lest  any  man  should  boast. 

For  we  are  his  workmanship,  created  in  Christ  Jesus 
unto  good  works,  which  God  hath  before  ordained  that 
we  should  walk  in  them. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (8:27-39) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  came  to  the  country  of  the  Ger- 
gasenes,  and  there  met  him  out  of  the  city  a  certain 
man  which  had  devils  long  time,  and  ware  not  clothes, 
neither  abode  in  any  house,  but  in  the  tombs. 

When  he  saw  Jesus,  he  cried  out,  and  fell  down  be- 
fore him,  and  with  a  loud  voice  said.  What  have  I  to  do 
with  thee,  Jesus,  thou  Son  of  God  most  high?  I  beseech 
thee,  torment  me  not. 

(For  he  had  commanded  the  unclean  spirit  to  come 
out  of  the  man.  For  oftentimes  it  had  caught  him :  and 
he  was  kept  bound  with  chains  and  in  fetters;  and  he 
brake  the  bands,  and  was  driven  of  the  devil  into  the 
wilderness.) 

And  Jesus  asked  him,  saying.  What  is  thy  name? 
And  he  said.  Legion :  because  many  devils  were  entered 
into  him. 

And  they  besought  him  that  he  would  not  command 
them  to  go  out  into  the  deep. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  259 

And  there  was  there  a  herd  of  many  swine  feeding 
on  the  mountain :  and  they  besought  him  that  he  would 
sufifer  them  to  enter  into  them.    And  he  suffered  them. 

Then  went  the  devils  out  of  the  man,  and  entered  into 
the  swine :  and  the  herd  ran  violently  down  a  steep  place 
into  the  lake,  and  were  choked. 

When  they  that  fed  them  saw  what  was  done,  they 
fled,  and  went  and  told  it  in  the  city  and  in  the  country. 

Then  they  went  out  to  see  what  was  done;  and  came 
to  Jesus,  and  found  the  man,  out  of  whom  the  devils 
were  departed,  sitting  at  the  feet  of  Jesus,  clothed,  and 
in  his  right  mind  :  and  they  were  afraid. 

They  also  which  saw  told  them  by  what  means  he 
that  was  possessed  of  the  devils  was  healed. 

Then  the  whole  multitude  of  the  country  of  the  Gad- 
arenes  round  about  besought  him  to  depart  from  them; 
for  they  were  taken  with  great  fear:  and  he  went  up 
into  the  ship,  and  returned  back  again. 

Now  the  man,  out  of  whom  the  devils  were  departed, 
besought  him  that  he  might  be  with  him:  but  Jesus 
sent  him  away,  saying, 

Return  to  thine  own  house,  and  show  how  great 
things  God  hath  done  unto  thee.  And  he  went  his  way, 
and  published  throughout  the  whole  city  how  great 
things  Jesus  had  done  unto  him.

The  Lord  will  give  strength  to  his  people. 
Bring  to  the  Lord,  O  ye  children  of  God. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Ephesians 
(2:U  to  end) 

"Y^E  brethren:  For  Christ  is  our  peace,  who  hath  made 
-■-    both  one,  and  hath  broken  down  the  middle  wall 
of  partition  between  us. 


260  Epistles  and  Gospels 

Having  abolished  in  his  flesh  the  enmity,  even  the 
law  of  commandments  contained  in  ordinances;  for  to 
make  in  himself  of  twain  one  new  man,  so  making 
peace; 

And  that  he  might  reconcile  both  unto  God  in  one 
body  by  the  cross,  having  slain  the  enmity  thereby: 

And  came  and  preached  peace  to  you  which  were 
afar  off,  and  to  them  that  were  nigh. 

For  through  him  we  both  have  access  by.  one  Spirit 
unto  the  Father. 

Now  therefore  ye  are  no  more  strangers  and  foreign- 
ers, but  fellow  citizens  with  the  saints,  and  of  the  house- 
hold of  God; 

And  are  built  upon  the  foundation  of  the  apostles 
and  prophets,  Jesus  Christ  himself  being  the  chief 
corner  stone; 

In  whom  all  the  building  fitly  framed  together  grow- 
eth  unto  an  holy  temple  in  the  Lord: 

In  whom  ye  also  are  builded  together  for  an  habita- 
tion of  God  through  the  Spirit. 

The  Gospel :  from  St.  Luke  (8 :41  to  end) 

AT  that  time:  There  came  a  man  to  Jesus  named 
Jairus,  and  he  was  a  ruler  of  the  synagogue;  and 
he  fell  down  at  Jesus'  feet,  and  besought  him  that  he 
would  come  into  his  house : 

For  he  had  one  only  daughter,  about  twelve  years  of 
age,  and  she  lay  a  dying.  But  as  he  went  the  people 
thronged  him. 

And  a  woman  having  an  issue  of  blood  twelve  years, 
which  had  spent  all  her  living  upon  physicians,  neither 
could  be  healed  of  any. 

Came  behind  him,  and  touched  the  border  of  his 
garment:  and  immediately  her  issue  of  blood  stanched. 

And  Jesus  said,  Who  touched  me?  When  all  denied, 
Peter  and  they  that  were  with  him  said,  Master,  the 
multitude  throng  thee  and  press  thee,  and  sayest  thou, 
Who  touched  me? 


Epistles  and  Gospels  261 

And  Jesus  said,  Somebody  hath  touched  me:  for  I 
perceive  that  virtue  is  gone  out  of  me. 

And  when  the  woman  saw  that  she  was  not  hid,  she 
came  trembling,  and  falling  down  before  him,  she 
declared  unto  him  before  all  the  people  for  what  cause 
she  had  touched  him,  and  how  she  was  healed  imme- 
diately. 

And  he  said  unto  her.  Daughter,  be  of  good  comfort: 
thy  faith  hath  made  thee  whole;  go  in  peace. 

While  he  yet  spake,  there  cometh  one  from  the  ruler 
of  the  synagogue's  house,  saying  to  him.  Thy  daughter 
is  dead;  trouble  not  the  Master. 

But  when  Jesus  heard  it,  he  answered  him,  saying, 
Fear  not:  believe  only,  and  she  shall  be  made  whole. 

And  when  he  came  into  the  house,  he  suffered  no 
man  to  go  in,  save  Peter,  and  James,  and  John,  and  the 
father  and  the  mother  of  the  maiden. 

And  all  wept,  and  bewailed  her:  but  he  said.  Weep 
not;  she  is  not  dead,  but  sleepeth. 

And  they  laughed  him  to  scorn,  knowing  that  she 
was  dead. 

And  he  put  them  all  out,  and  took  her  by  the  hand, 
and  called,  saying.  Maid,  arise. 

And  her  spirit  came  again,  and  she  arose  straight- 
way: and  he  commanded  to  give  her  meat. 

And  her  parents  were  astonished:  but  he  charged 
them  that  they  should  tell  no  man  what  was  done.

Vow  ye,  and  pay  to  the  Lord  your  God. 
In  Judah  is  God  known. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Ephesians 

(4:1-7) 

'Y^E  brethren:  I  therefore,  the  prisoner  of  the  Lord, 
beseech  you  that  ye  walk  worthy  of  the  vocation 
wherewith  ye  are  called; 


262  Epistles  and  Gospels 

With  all  lowliness  and  meekness,  with  long-suffering, 
forbearing  one  another  in  love; 

Endeavouring  to  keep  the  unity  of  the  Spirit  in  the 
bond  of  peace. 

There  is  one  body,  and  one  Spirit,  even  as  ye  are 
called  in  one  hope  of  your  calling; 

One  Lord,  one  faith,  one  baptism, 

One  God  and  Father  of  all,  who  is  above  all,  and 
through  all,  and  in  you  all. 

But  unto  every  one  of  us  is  given  grace  according  to 
the  measure  of  the  gift  of  Christ. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (10:25-37) 
AT  that  time:  A  certain  lawyer  came   and   asked 
Jesus,  tempting  him,  saying,  Master,  what  shall  I 
do  to  inherit  eternal  life? 

He  said  unto  him,  What  is  written  in  the  law?  how 
readest  thou? 

And  he  answering  said.  Thou  shalt  love  the  Lord  thy 
God  with  all  thy  heart,  and  with  all  thy  soul,  and  with 
all  thy  strength,  and  with  all  thy  mind;  and  thy  neigh- 
bour as  thyself. 

And  he  said  unto  him,  Thou  hast  answered  right: 
this  do,  and  thou  shalt  live. 

But  he,  willing  to  justify  himself,  said  unto  Jesus, 
And  who  is  my  neighbour? 

And  Jesus  answering  said,  A  certain  man  went  down 
from  Jerusalem  to  Jericho,  and  fell  among  thieves, 
which  stripped  him  of  his  raiment  and  wounded  him, 
and  departed,  leaving  him  half  dead. 

And  by  chance  there  came  down  a  certain  priest  that 
way;  and  when  he  saw  him,  he  passed  by  on  the  other 
side. 

And  likewise  a  Levite,  when  he  was  at  the  place, 
came  and  looked  on  him,  and  passed  by  on  the  other 
side. 

But  a  certain  Samaritan,  as  he  journeyed,  came  where 
he  was;  and  when  he  saw  him,  he  had  compassion  on 
him, 


Epistles  and  Gospels  263 

And  went  to  him,  and  bound  up  his  wounds,  pouring 
in  oil  and  wine,  and  set  him  on  his  own  beast,  and 
brought  him  to  an  inn,  and  took  care  of  him. 

And  on  the  morrow  when  he  departed,  he  took  out 
two  pence,  and  gave  them  to  the  host,  and  said  unto 
him.  Take  care  of  him :  and  whatsoever  thou  spendest 
more,  when  I  come  again,  I  will  repay  thee. 

Which  now  of  these  three,  thinkest  thou,  was  neigh- 
bour unto  him  that  fell  among  the  thieves? 

And  he  said,  He  that  showed  mercy  on  him.  Then 
said  Jesus  unto  him.  Go,  and  do  thou  likewise. 

Twenty-sixth  Sunday 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  First  Tone 

Let  thy  mercy,  O  Lord,  be  upon  us. 
Rejoice  in  the  Lord,  O  ye  just. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Ephesians 

(5:8-19) 

^E  brethren:  Walk  as  the  children  of  light: 
^       (For  the  fruit  of  the  Spirit  is  in  all  goodness  and 
righteousness  and  truth;) 

Proving  what  is  acceptable  unto  the  Lord. 
And  have  no  fellowship  with  the  unfruitful  works  of 
darkness,  but  rather  reprove  them. 

For  it  is  a  shame  even  to  speak  of  those  things  which 
are  done  of  them  in  secret. 

But  all  things  that  are  reproved  are  made  manifest 
by  the  light :  for  whatsoever  doth  make  manifest  is  light. 

Wherefore  he  saith.  Awake  thou  that  sleepest,  and 
arise  from  the  dead,  and  Christ  shall  give  thee  light. 

See  then  that  ye  walk  circumspectly,  not  as  fools, 
but  as  wise, 

Redeeming  the  time,  because  the  days  are  evil. 

Wherefore  be  ye  not  unwise,  but  understanding  what 
the  will  of  the  Lord  is. 


264  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  be  not  drunk  with  wine,  wherein  is  excess;  but 
be  filled  with  the  Spirit; 

Speaking  to  yourselves  in  psalms  and  hymns  and 
spiritual  songs,  singing  and  making  melody  in  your 
heart  to  the  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (12:16-21) 

nPHE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  The  ground  of  a  cer- 
tain rich  man  brought  forth  plentifully: 

And  he  thought  within  himself,  saying.  What  shall 
I  do,  because  I  have  no  room  where  to  bestow  my 
fruits? 

And  he  said,  This  will  I  do :  I  will  pull  down  my 
barns,  and  build  greater;  and  there  will  I  bestow  all 
my  fruits  and  my  goods. 

And  I  will  say  to  my  soul.  Soul,  thou  hast  much 
goods  laid  up  for  many  years ;  take  thine  ease,  eat,  drink, 
and  be  merry. 

But  God  said  unto  him,  Thou  fool,  this  night  thy 
soul  shall  be  required  of  thee:  then  whose  shall  those 
things  be,  which  thou  hast  provided? 

So  is  he  that  layeth  up  treasure  for  himself,  and  is  not 
rich  toward  God.  And  when  he  had  said  these  things, 
he  cried,  He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear. 

Twenty-seventh  Sunday

(6:10-17) 

\/^E  brethren:  Be  strong  in  the  Lord,  and  in  the  power 
^  of  his  might. 

Put  on  the  whole  armour  of  God,  that  ye  may  be  able 
to  stand  against  the  wiles  of  the  devil. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  265 

For  we;  wrestle  not  against  flesh  and  blood,  but 
against  principalities,  against  powers,  against  the  rul- 
ers of  the  darkness  of  this  world,  against  spiritual  wick- 
edness in  high  places. 

Wherefore  take  unto  you  the  whole  armour  of  God, 
that  ye  may  be  able  to  withstand  in  the  evil  day,  and 
having  done  all,  to  stand. 

Stand  therefore,  having  your  loins  girt  about  with 
truth,  and  having  on  the  breastplate  of  righteousness; 

And  your  feet  shod  with  the  preparation  of  the  gospel 
of  peace; 

Above  all,  taking  the  shield  of  faith,  wherewith  ye 
shall  be  able  to  quench  all  the  fiery  darts  of  the  wicked. 

And  take  the  helmet  of  salvation,  and  the  sword  of 
the  Spirit,  which  is  the  word  of  God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (13:10-17) 

AT  that  time:  While  Jesus  was  teaching  in  one  of 

the  synagogues  on  the  sabbath,  behold,  there  was  a 

woman  which  had  a  spirit  of  infirmity  eighteen  years, 

and  was  bowed  together,  and  could  in  no  wise  lift  up 

herself. 

And  when  Jesus  saw  her,  he  called  her  to  him,  and 
said  unto  her.  Woman,  thou  art  loosed  from  thine  in- 
firmity. 

And  he  laid  his  hands  on  her:  and  immediately  she 
was  made  straight,  and  glorified  God. 

And  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  answered  with  indig- 
nation, because  that  Jesus  had  healed  on  the  sabbath 
day,  and  said  unto  the  people.  There  are  six  days  in 
which  men  ought  to  work:  in  them  therefore  come  and 
be  healed,  and' not  on  the  sabbath  day. 

The  Lord  then  answered  him,  and  said,  Thou  hypo- 
crite, doth  not  each  one  of  you  on  the  sabbath  loose  his 
ox  or  his  ass  from  the  stall,  and  lead  him  away  to 
watering? 

And  ought  not  this  woman,  being  a  daughter  of 
Abraham,  whom  Satan  hath  bound,  lo,  these  eighteen 
years,  be  loosed  from  this  bond  on  the  sabbath  day? 


266  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  all  his  adversaries 
were  ashamed:  and  all  the  people  rejoiced  for  all  the 
glorious  things  that  were  done  by  him.

'Y^E  brethren:  Give  thanks  unto  the  Father,  which 
-■■  hath  made  us  meet  to  be  partakers  of  the  inherit- 
ance of  the  saints  in  light; 

Who  hath  delivered  us  from  the  power  of  darkness, 
and  hath  translated  us  into  the  kingdom  of  his  dear  Son : 

In  whom  we  have  redemption  through  his  blood, 
even  the  forgiveness  of  sins : 

Who  is  the  image  of  the  invisible  God,  the  firstborn 
of  every  creature : 

For  by  him  were  all  things  created,  that  are  in  heaven, 
and  that  are  in  earth,  visible  and  invisible,  whether 
they  be  thrones,  or  dominions,  or  principalities,  or  pow- 
ers :  all  things  were  created  by  him,  and  for  him : 

And  he  is  before  all  things,  and  by  him  all  things 
consist: 

And  he  is  the  head  of  the  body,  the  church :  who  is 
the  beginning,  the  firstborn  from  the  dead;  that  in  all 
things  he  might  have  the  preeminence. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (14:16-24) 

nPHE  Lord  spake  this  parable:  A  certain  man  made 
a  great  supper,  and  bade  many: 
And  sent  his  servant  at  supper  time  to  say  to  them 
that  were  bidden.  Come;  for  all  things  are  now  ready. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  267 

And  they  all  with  one  consent  began  to  make  excuse. 
The  first  said  unto  him,  I  have  bought  a  piece  of 
ground,  and  I  must  needs  go  and  see  it :  I  pray  thee  have 
me  excused. 

And  another  said,  I  have  bought  five  yoke  of  oxen, 
and  I  go  to  prove  them :  I  pray  thee  have  me  excused. 

And  another  said,  I  have  married  a  wife,  and  there- 
fore I  cannot  come. 

So  that  servant  came,  and  showed  his  lord  these 
things.  Then  the  master  of  the  house  being  angry  said 
to  his  servant.  Go  out  quickly  into  the  streets  and  lanes 
of  the  city,  and  bring  in  hither  the  poor,  and  the 
maimed,  and  the  halt,  and  the  blind. 

And  the  servant  said.  Lord,  it  is  done  as  thou  hast 
commanded,  and  yet  there  is  room. 

And  the  lord  said  unto  the  servant,  Go  out  into  the 
highways  and  hedges,  and  compel  them  to  come  in,  that 
my  house  may  be  filled. 

For  I  say  unto  you,  That  none  of  those  men  which 
were  bidden  shall  taste  of  my  supper,  for  many  are 
called,  but  few  are  chosen.

'VT'E  brethren:  When  Christ,  who  is  our  life,  shall  ap- 
^    pear,  then  shall  we  also  appear  with  him  in  glory. 

Mortify  therefore  your  members  which  are  upon  the

evil  concupiscence,  and  covetousness,  which  is  idolatry: 

For  which  things'  sake  the  wrath  of  God  cometh  on

268  Epistles  and  Gospels 

In  the  which  ye  also  walked  sometime,  when  ye 
lived  in  them. 

But  now  ye  also  put  off  all  these;  anger,  wrath, 
malice,  blasphemy,  filthy  communication  out  of  your 
mouth. 

Lie  not  one  to  another,  seeing  that  ye  have  put  off  the 
old  man  with  his  deeds; 

And  have  put  on  the  new  man,  which  is  renewed  in 
knowledge  after  the  image  of  him  that  created  him: 

Where  there  is  neither  Greek  nor  Jew,  circumcision 
nor  uncircumcision,  Barbarian,  Scythian,  bond  nor 
free:  but  Christ  is  all,  and  in  all. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (17:12-19) 

A  T  that  time :  As  Jesus  was  entering  a  certain  village, 
^  ■  there  met  him  ten  men  that  were  lepers^  which 
stood  afar  off; 

And  they  lifted  up  their  voices,  and  said,  Jesus,  Mas- 
ter, have  mercy  on  us. 

And  when  he  saw  them,  he  said  unto  them.  Go  show 
yourselves  unto  the  priests.  And  it  came  to  pass,  that, 
as  they  went,  they  were  cleansed. 

And  one  of  them,  when  he  saw  that  he  was  healed, 
turned  back,  and  with  a  loud  voice  glorified  God, 

And  fell  down  on  his  face  at  his  feet,  giving  him 
thanks:  and  he  was  a  Samaritan. 

And  Jesus  answering  said.  Were  there  not  ten 
cleansed?  but  where  are  the  nine? 

There  are  not  found  that  returned  to  give  glory  to 
God,  save  this  stranger. 

And  he  said  unto  him.  Arise,  go  thy  way:  thy  faith 
hath  made  thee  whole.

forgave  you,  so  also  do  ye. 

And  above  all  these  things  put  on  charity,  which  is

And  let  the  peace  of  God  rule  in  your  hearts,  to

Let  the  word  of  Christ  dwell  in  you  richly  in  all

AT  that  time:  A  certain  ruler  came  and  asked  Jesus 
tempting  him,  saying.  Good  Master,  what  shall  I 
do  to  inherit  eternal  life? 

And  Jesus  said  unto  him.  Why  callest  thou  me  good? 
none  is  good,  save  one,  that  is,  God. 

Thou  knowest  the  commandments.  Do  not  commit 
adultery,  Do  not  kill,  Do  not  steal.  Do  not  bear  false 
witness.  Honour  thy  father  and  thy  mother. 

And  he  said.  All  these  have  I  kept  from  my  youth  up. 

Now  when  Jesus  heard  these  things,  he  said  unto  him. 
Yet  lackest  thou  one  thing:  sell  all  that  thou  hast,  and 
distribute  unto  the  poor,  and  thou  shalt  have  treasure 
in  heaven:  and  come,  follow  me. 

And  when  he  heard  this,  he  was  very  sorrowful:  for 
he  was  very  rich. 

And  when  Jesus  saw  that  he  was  very  sorrowful,  he 
said,  How  hardly  shall  they  that  have  riches  enter  into 
the  kingdom  of  God! 


270  Epistles  and  Gospels 

For  it  is  easier  for  a  camel  to  go  through  a  needle's 
eye,  than  for  a  rich  man  to  enter  into  the  kingdom  of 
God! 

And  they  that  heard  it  said,  Who  then  can  be  saved? 

And  he  said.  The  things  which  are  impossible  with 
men  are  possible  with  God.

Section  from  the  First  Kpistle  of  St.  Paul  to  Timothy 

(1:15-17) 

IV/TY  child  Timothy:  A  faithful  saying,  and  worthy 
-''  ^  of  all  acceptation,  that  Christ  Jesus  came  into  this 
world  to  save  sinners;  of  whom  I  am  chief. 

Howbeit  for  this  cause  I  obtained  mercy,  that  in  me 
first  Jesus  Christ  might  show  forth  all  long-sufifering, 
for  a  pattern  to  them  which  should  hereafter  believe  on 
him  to  life  everlasting. 

Now  unto  the  King  eternal,  immortal,  invisible,  the 
only  wise  God,  be  honour  and  glory  for  ever  and  ever. 
Amen. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (18:35  to  end) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  came  nigh  unto  Jericho, 
^^  a  certain  blind  man  sat  by  the  wayside  begging: 

And  hearing  the  multitude  pass  by,  he  asked  what 
it  meant. 

And  they  told  him,  that  Jesus  of  Nazareth  passeth  by. 

And  he  cried,  saying,  Jesus,  thou  son  of  David,  have 
mercy  on  me. 

And  they  which  went  before  rebuked  him,  that  he 
should  hold  his  peace:  but  he  cried  so  much  the  more, 
Thou  son  of  David,  have  mercy  on  me. 

And  Jesus  stood,  and  commanded  him  to  be  brought 
unto  him :  and  when  he  was  come  near,  he  asked  him, 


Epistles  and  Gospels  271 

Saying,  What  wilt  thou  that  I  shall  do  unto  thee? 
And  he  said,  Lord,  that  I  may  receive  my  sight. 

And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Receive  thy  sight:  thy  faith 
hath  saved  thee. 

And  immediately  he  received  his  sight,  and  followed 
him,  glorifying  God:  and  all  the  people,  when  they  saw 
it,  gave  praise  unto  God.

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  Timothy 

(4:9-15) 

IX/TY  son  Timothy:  A  faithful  saying  and  worthy  of 
^   ^  all  acceptation. 

For  therefore  we  both  labour  and  suffer  reproach, 
because  we  trust  in  the  living  God,  who  is  the  Saviour 
of  all  men,  specially  of  those  that  believe. 

These  things  command  and  teach. 

Let  no  man  despise  thy  youth;  but  be  thou  an  exam- 
ple of  the  believers,  in  word,  in  conversation,  in  charity, 
in  spirit,  in  faith,  in  purity. 

Till  I  come,  give  attendance  to  reading,  to  exhorta- 
tion, to  doctrine. 

Neglect  not  the  gift  that  is  in  thee,  which  was  given 
thee  by  prophecy,  with  the  laying  on  of  the  hands  of  the 
presbytery. 

Meditate  upon  these  things;  give  thyself  wholly  to 
them;  that  thy  profiting  may  appear  to  all. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (19:1-10) 

AT   that   time:   Jesus   entered   and   passed  through 
Jericho. 


272  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And,  behold,  there  was  a  man  named  Zacchaeus. 
which  was  the  chief  among  the  publicans,  and  he  was 
rich. 

And  he  sought  to  see  Jesus  who  he  was;  and  could 
not  for  the  press,  because  he  was  little  of  stature. 

And  he  ran  before,  and  climbed  up  into  a  sycamore 
tree  to  see  him;  for  he  was  to  pass  that  way. 

And  when  Jesus  came  to  the  place,  he  looked  up,  and 
saw  him,  and  said  unto  him,  Zacchaeus,  make  haste,  and 
come  down;  for  to-day  I  must  abide  at  thy  house. 

And  he  made  haste,  and  came  down,  and  received 
him  joyfully. 

And  when  they  saw  it,  they  all  murmured,  saying. 
That  he  was  gone  to  be  guest  with  a  man  that  is  a  sinner. 

And  Zacchaeus  stood,  and  said  unto  the  Lord;  Behold 
Lord,  the  half  of  my  goods  I  give  to  the  poor;  and  if 
I  have  taken  any  thing  from  any  man  by  false  accusa- 
tion, I  restore  him  fourfold. 

And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  This  day  is  salvation  come 
to  this  house,  forsomuch  as  he  also  is  a  son  of  Abraham. 

For  the  Son  of  man  is  come  to  seek  and  to  save  that 
which  was  lost.

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 
(11:9-10;  32  to  end) 

"Y^E  brethren :  By  faith  Abraham  sojourned  in  the  land 
-'■  of  promise,  as  in  a  strange  country,  dwelling  in 
tabernacles  with  Isaac  and  Jacob,  the  heirs  with  him  of 
the  same  promise: 

For  he  looked  for  a  city  which  hath  foundations, 
whose  builder  and  maker  is  God. 

And  what  shall  I  more  say?  for  the  time  would  fail 
me  to  tell  of  Gideon,  and  of  Barak,  and  of  Samson,  and 
of  Jephthae;  of  David  also,  and  Samuel,  and  of  the 
prophets: 

Who  through  faith  subdued  kingdoms,  wrought 
righteousness,  obtained  promises,  stopped  the  mouths 
of  lions. 

Quenched  the  violence  of  fire,  escaped  the  edge  of 
the  sword,  out  of  weakness  were  made  strong,  waxed 
valiant  in  fight,  turned  to  flight  the  armies  of  the  aliens. 

Women  received  their  dead  raised  to  life  again:  and 
others  were  tortured,  not  accepting  deliverance;  that 
they  might  obtain  a  better  resurrection: 

And  others  had  trial  of  cruel  mockings  and  scourg- 
ings,  yea,  moreover  of  bonds  and  imprisonment: 

They  were  stoned,  they  were  sawn  asunder,  were 
tempted,  were  slain  with  the  sword:  they  wandered 
about  in  sheepskins  and  goatskins;  being  destitute,  af- 
flicted, tormented ; 

(Of  whom  the  world  was  not  worthv:)  they  wan- 
dered in  deserts,  and  in  mountains,  and  in  dens  and 
caves  of  the  earth. 


274  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  these  all,  having  obtained  a  good  report  through

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (1:1  to  end) 

^TpHE  book  of  the  generation  of  Jesus  Christ,  the  son 
■^  of  David,  the  son  of  Abraham. 

Abraham  begat  Isaac;  and  Isaac  begat  Jacob;  and 
Jacob  begat  Judas  and  his  brethren; 

And  Judas  begat  Phares  and  Zara  of  Thamar;  and 
Phares  begat  Esrom;  and  Esrom  begat  Aram; 

And  Aram  begat  Aminadab;  and  Aminadab  begat

And  Josias  begat  Jechonias  and  his  brethren,  about 
the  time  they  were  carried  away  to  Babylon: 

And  after  they  were  brought  to  Babylon,  Jechonias 
beeat  Salathiel:  and  Salathiel  begat  Zorobabel;

and  Achim  begat  Eliud; 

And  Eliud  begat  Eleazar;  and  Eleazar  begat  Mat- 
than;  and  Matthan  begat  Jacob; 

And  Jacob  begat  Joseph  the  husband  of  Mary,  of 
whom  was  born  Jesus,  who  is  called  Christ. 


Epistles  and  Gospels  275 

So  all  the  generations  from  Abraham  to  David  are 
fourteen  generations;  and  from  David  until  the  carry- 
ing away  into  Babylon  are  fourteen  generations;  and 
from  the  carrying  away  into  Babylon  unto  Christ  are 
fourteen  generations. 

Now  the  birth  of  Jesus  Christ  was  on  this  wise :  When 
as  his  mother  Mary  was  espoused  to  Joseph,  before 
they  came  together,  she  was  found  with  child  of  the 
Holy  Ghost. 

Then  Joseph  her  husband,  being  a  just  man,  and  no'<: 
willing  to  make  her  a  public  example,  was  minded  to 
put  her  away  privily. 

But  while  he  thought  on  these  things,  behold,  the 
angel  of  the  Lord  appeared  unto  him  in  a  dream,  say- 
ing, Joseph,  thou  son  of  David,  fear  not  to  take  unto 
thee  Marv  thy  wife:  for  that  which  is  conceived  in  her 
is  of  the  Holy  Ghost. 

And  she  shall  bring  forth  a  son,  and  thou  shalt  call 
his  name  Jesus:  for  he  shall  save  his  people  from  their 
sins. 

Now  all  this  was  done,  that  it  might  be  fulfilled 
which  was  spoken  of  the  Lord  by  the  prophet,  saying, 

Behold,  a  virgin  shall  be  with  child,  and  shall  bring 
forth  a  son,  and  they  shall  call  his  name  Emmanuel, 
w^hich  being  interpreted  is,  God  with  us. 

Then  Joseph  beine  raised  from  sleep  did  as  the  anp:el 
of  the  Lord  had  bidden  him,  and  took  unto  him  his 
wife: 

And  knew  her  not  till  she  had  brought  forth  her 
firstborn  son:  and  he  called  his  name  Jesus.

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Galatians 

Ye  brethren:  I  certify  you,  that  the  gospel,  etc.  (p. 
254). 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (2: 13  to  end) 

A  ND  after  the  Magi  were  departed,  the  angel  of  the 
Lord  appeareth  to  Joseph  in  a  dream,  saying. 
Arise,  and  take  the  young  child  and  his  mother,  and 
flee  into  Egypt,  and  be  thou  there  until  I  bring  thee 
word:  for  Herod  will  seek  the  young  child  to  destroy 
him. 

When  he  arose,  he  took  the  young  child  and  his 
mother  by  night,  and  departed  into  Egypt: 

And  was  there  until  the  death  of  Herod  :  that  it  might 
be  fulfilled  which  was  spoken  of  the  Lord  by  the 
prophet,  saying.  Out  of  Egypt  have  I  called  my  son. 

Then  Herod,  when  he  saw  that  he  was  mocked  of  the 
wise  men,  was  exceeding  wroth,  and  sent  forth,  and 
slew  all  the  children  that  were  in  Bethlehem,  and  in 
all  the  coasts  thereof,  from  two  years  old  and  under, 
according  to  the  time  which  he  had  diligently  inquired 
of  the  wise  men. 

Then  was  fulfilled  that  which  was  spoken  by  Jeremy 
the  prophet,  saying. 

In  Rama  was  there  a  voice  heard,  lamentation,  and 
weeping,  and  great  mourning,  Rachel  weeping  for  her 
children,  and  would  not  be  comforted,  because  they 
are  not. 

But  when  Herod  was  dead,  behold,  an  angel  of  the 
Lord  appeareth  in  a  dream  to  Joseph  in  Egypt, 

Saying,  Arise,  and  take  the  young  child  and  his 
mother,  and  go  into  the  land  of  Israel:  for  they  are 
dead  which  sought  the  young  child's  life. 

And  he  arose,  and  took  the  young  child  and  his 
mother,  and  came  into  the  land  of  Israel. 

But  when  he  heard  that  Archelaus  did  reign  in 
Judaea  in  the  room  of  his  father  Herod,  he  was  afraid 
to  go  thither:  notwithstanding,  being  warned  of  God  in 


Epistles  and  Gospels  277 

a  dream,  he  turned  aside  into  the  parts  of  Galilee: 

And  he  came  and  dwelt  in  a  city  called  Nazareth: 
that  it  might  be  fulfilled  which  was  spoken  by  the 
prophets,  He  shall  be  called  a  Nazarene.

1  have  fought  a  good  fight,  I  have  finished  my  course, 
I  have  kept  the  faith: 

Henceforth  there  is  laid  up  for  me  a  crown  of  right- 
eousness, which  the  Lord,  the  righteous  judge,  shall 
give  me  at  that  day:  and  not  to  me  only,  but  unto  all 
them  also  that  love  his  appearing. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (1:1-8) 

^T^HE  beginning  of  the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ,  the

As  it  is  written  in  the  prophets.  Behold,  I  send  my 
messenger  before  thy  face,  which  shall  prepare  thy  way 
before  thee. 

The  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilderness,  Prepare 
ye  the  way  of  the  Lord,  make  his  paths  straight. 

John  did  baptize  in  the  wilderness,  and  preach  the 
baptism  of  repentance  for  the  remission  of  sins. 


278  Epistles  and  Gospels 

And  there  went  out  unto  him  all  the  land  of  Judaea, 
and  they  of  Jerusalem,  and  were  all  baptized  of  him  in 
the  river  of  Jordan,  confessing  their  sins. 

And  John  was  clothed  with  camel's  hair,  and  with  a 
girdle  of  a  skin  about  his  loins;  and  he  did  eat  locusts 
and  wild  honey; 

And  preached,  saying.  There  cometh  one  mightier 
than  I  after  me,  the  latchet  of  whose  shoes  I  am  not 
worthy  to  stoop  down  and  unloose. 

I  indeed  have  baptized  you  with  water:  but  he  shall 
baptize  you  with  the  Holy  Ghost.

Rejoice  in  the  Lord,  O  ye  just. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Ephesians 

(4:7-13) 

VT'E  brethren:  Unto  every  one  of  us  is  given  grace 
^    according  to  the  measure  of  the  gift  of  Christ. 

Wherefore  he  saith.  When  he  ascended  up  on  high, 
he  led  captivity  captive,  and  gave  gifts  unto  men. 

(Now  that  he  ascended,  what  is  it  but  that  he  also 
descended  first  into  the  lower  parts  of  the  earth? 

He  that  descended  is  the  same  also  that  ascended  up 
far  above  all  heavens,  that  he  might  fill  all  things.) 

And  he  gave  some,  apostles;  and  some,  prophets;  and 
some,  evangelists;  and  some,  pastors  and  teachers; 

For  the  perfecting  of  the  saints,  for  the  work  of  the 
ministry,  for  the  edifying  of  the  body  of  Christ: 

Till  we  all  come  in  the  unity  of  the  faith,  and  of  the 
knowledge  of  the  Son  of  God,  unto  a  perfect  man,  unto 
the  measure  of  the  stature  of  the  fullness  of  Christ: 


Epistles  and  Gospels  279 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (4:12-17) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  had  heard  that  John  was 
cast  into  prison,  he  departed  into  Galilee; 

And  leaving  Nazareth,  he  came  and  dwelt  in  Caper- 
naum, which  is  upon  the  seacoast,  in  the  borders  of 
Zabulon  and  Nephthalim : 

That  it  might  be  fulfilled  which  was  spoken  by  Esaias 
the  prophet,  saying. 

The  land  of  Zabulon,  and  the  land  of  Nephthalim, 
by  the  way  of  the  sea,  beyond  Jordan,  Galilee  of  the 
Gentiles ; 

The  people  which  sat  in  darkness  saw  great  light; 
and  to  them  which  sat  in  the  region  and  shadow  of 
death  light  is  sprung  up. 

From  that  time  Jesus  began  to  preach,  and  to  say. 
Repent:  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is  at  hand.

By  Sergius  The  Jerusalemite 
^T^ODAY  hath  God  who  sitteth  on  noetic  thrones  pre- 
^  pared  himself  a  holy  throne  on  earth.  He  who  hath 
established  the  heavens  in  wisdom  hath,  by  his  love  to 
mankind,  made  a  living  heaven;  for  from  a  barren 
stem  he  hath  brought  forth  his  Mother,  a  life-bearing 
branch.  Thou  God  of  wonders  and  Hope  of  the  hope- 
less, O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

This  is  the  day  of  the  Lord;  wherefore,  rejoice  ye 
nations;  for  behold  the  chamber  of  Light,  the  scroll  of 
the  Word  of  life  hath  come  forth  from  the  womb;  the 
gate  facing  the  east  hath  been  born.  Wherefore,  she 
awaiteth  the  entrance  of  the  High  Priest.  And  she 
alone  admitted  Christ  into  the  universe  for  the  salva- 
tion of  our  souls. 

While  famous  barren  women  there  were  who  bore 
fruit  by  the  will  of  God,  verily  Mary  hath  surpassed, 
having  been  born  in  a  strange  manner  from  a  barren 
mother,  she  herself  gave  birth  in  the  flesh  to  the  End 
of  all,  from  a  seedless  womb  in  a  transcendent  manner. 
And  she  alone  is  the  door  of  the  only  Son  of  God 
through  which  he  passed  and  which  he  left  closed,  pro- 
viding all  with  wisdom,  as  he  himself  knew,  and 
brought  salvation  to  all  mankind. 

By  Stephen  the  Jerusalemite 

^  I  ^ODAY   the   barren   gates   are  opened,    and   there 

Cometh  forth  the  divine,  the  virginal  gate.    Today 

hath  grace  begun  to  give  fruit,  showing  forth  to  the 


284  Menaion 

world  the  Theotokos,  through  whom  the  earthly  and 
the  heavenly  beings  unite  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls. 

Today  the  glad  tidings  go  forth  to  the  world.  Today 
sweet  fragrance  is  wafted  forth,  foretelling  the  glad  tid- 
ings of  salvation;  and  the  barrenness  of  our  nature  hath 
been  united:  for  the  barren  one  hath  become  a  mother 
to  the  one  who  remained  a  Virgin  after  giving  birth  to 
the  Creator;  from  whom  cometh  the  God  in  nature, 
taking  a  foreign  nature  and  working  salvation  in  the 
flesh  for  the  lost,  Christ,  the  Lover  of  mankind,  and  the 
Deliverer  of  our  souls. 

Today  Anne  the  barren  giveth  birth  to  the  Maiden 
of  God,  forechosen  from  all  generations  as  a  dwelling- 
place  for  Christ  God,  King  of  all  and  Creator  of  all,  for 
the  fulfillment  of  his  divine  dispensation,  through  which 
the  creation  of  us  earthly  beings  was  renewed,  and  we 
ourseves  were  renewed  from  corruption  to  life  im- 
mortal. 

^Glory  and  Now;  the  First  piece  of  the  above  Idiornelons,  i.e.  Today 
hath  God  who  sitteth,  etc;  and  after  the  daily  Prokeiinenon,  the  fol- 
lowing Prophecies. 

First  Reading:  from  Genesis  (28  'Al-t7 ) 

A  ND  when  he  was  come  to  a  certain  place,  and 
would  rest  in  it  after  sunset,  he  took  of  the  stones 
that  lay  there,  and  putting  them  under  his  head,  slept 
in  the  same  place. 

And  he  saw  in  his  sleep  a  ladder  standing  upon  the 
earth,  and  the  top  thereof  touching  heaven :  the  angels 
also  of  God  ascending  and  descending  by  it; 

And  the  Lord  leaning  upon  the  ladder,  saying  to  him  : 
I  am  the  Lord  God  of  Abraham  thy  father,  and  the 
God  of  Isaac;  the  land,  wherein  thou  sleepest,  I  will 
give  to  thee  and  to  thy  seed. 

And  thy  seed  shall  be  as  the  dust  of  the  earth :  thou 
shalt  spread  abroad  to  the  west,  and  to  the  east,  and  to 
the  north,  and  to  the  south :  and  in  thee  and  thy  seed  all 
the  tribes  of  the  earth  shall  be  blessed. 


September  8 — Nativity  of  Our  Lady  285 

And  I  will  be  thy  keeper  whithersoever  thou  goest, 
and  will  bring  thee  back  into  this  land:  neither  will  I 
leave  thee,  till  I  shall  have  accomplished  all  that  I  have 
said. 

And  when  Jacob  awaked  out  of  sleep,  he  said  :  Indeed 
the  Lord  is  in  this  place,  and  I  knew  it  not. 

And  trembling  he  said:  How  terrible  is  this  place! 
This  is  no  other  but  the  house  of  God,  and  the  gate  of 
heaven. 

Second  Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Ezekiel  the 
Prophet  (43:27;  44:14) 

A  ND  the  days  being  expired,  on  the  eighth  day  and 
thenceforward  the  priests  shall  offer  your  holo- 
causts upon  the  altar,  and  the  peace  offerings:  and  I 
will  be  pacified  towards  you,  saith  the  Lord  God. 

And  he  brought  me  back  to  the  way  of  the  gate  of  the 
outward  sanctuary,  which  looked  towards  the  east:  and 
it  was  shut. 

And  the  Lord  said  to  me:  This  gate  shall  be  shut,  it 
shall  not  be  opened,  and  no  man  shall  pass  through  it: 
because  the  Lord  the  God  of  Israel  hath  entered  in  by 
it,  and  it  shall  be  shut 

For  the  prince.  The  prince  himself  shall  sit  in  it, 
to  eat  bread  before  the  Lord:  he  shall  enter  in  by  the 
way  of  the  porch  of  the  gate,  and  shall  go  out  by  the 
same  way. 

And  he  brought  me  by  the  way  of  the  north  gate,  in 
the  sight  of  the  house:  and  I  saw,  and  behold,  the  glory 
of  the  Lord  filled  the  house  of  the  Lord:  and  I  fell  on 
my  face. 

Third  Reading:  from  the  Proverbs  of  Solomon  the 
Wise  (9:1-11) 

V\/LSDOM  hath  built  herself  a  house,  she  hath  hewn 
her  out  seven  pillars. 
She  hath  slain  her  victims,  mingled  her  wine,  and 
set  forth  her  table. 


286  Menaion 

She  hath  sent  her  maids  to  invite  to  the  tower,  and 
to  the  walls  of  the  city: 

Whosoever  is  a  little  one,  let  him  come  to  me.  And 
to  the  unwise  she  said: 

Come,  eat  my  bread,  and  drink  the  wine  which  I 
have  mingled  for  you. 

Forsake  childishness,  and  live,  and  seek  prudence 
for  a  pleasant  life  whereby  to  perfect  understanding 
through  knowledge. 

He  that  teacheth  a  scorner,  doth  an  injury  to  him- 
self :  and  he  that  rebuketh  a  wicked  man,  getteth  him- 
self a  blot;  for  reprimands  are  wounds  to  the  wicked. 

Rebuke  not  a  scorner  lest  he  hate  thee.  Rebuke  a 
wise  man,  and  he  will  love  thee. 

Give  an  occasion  to  a  wise  man,  and  wisdom  shall  be 
added  to  him.  Teach  a  just  man,  and  he  shall  make 
haste  to  receive  it. 

The  fear  of  the  Lord  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom: 
and  the  knowledge  of  the  holy  is  prudence. 

For  by  me  shall  thy  days  be  multiplied,  and  years  of 
life  shall  be  added  to  thee.

Tone.

C\^  this  our  illustrious  feast  day,  let  us  strike  our 
^^^  spiritual  harps;  for  today  the  Mother  of  Life,  who 
is  the  renewal  of  the  creation  of  Adam  and  the  recall 
of  Eve,  the  fountain  of  incorruption,  the  liberation 
from  corruption,  through  whom  we  have  been  deified 
and  delivered  from  death,  is  born  of  the  seed  of  David, 
dispersing  darkness.  Wherefore,  let  us  believers  cry 
unto  her  joyfully  with  Gabriel,  Hail,  O  full  of  grace.

the  Great  Mercy.

"^  from  the  two  righteous  ones,  Joachim  and  Anne, 


September  8— Nativity  of  Our  Lady  287 

verily  the  all  extolled  Virgin,  who  because  of  her  sur- 
passing purity  became  a  living  temple  of  God,  and 
alone  is  known  as  truly  Theotokos.  Wherefore,  by  her 
intercessions,  O  Christ  God,  send  forth  safety  to  the 
world,  and  to  our  souls  the  Great  Mercy. 

Stichos:    Hearken,  O  daughter  and  consider. 

Today,  O  Virgin,  thou  hast  been  born  a  most  noble 
child  from  the  righteous  ones,  Joachim  and  Anne,  as 
angels  foretold,  O  paradise  and  throne  of  God,  O  vessel 
of  purity  who  went  before  and  proclaimed  joy  unto  all 
the  world,  O  cause  of  our  life  and  annihilation  of  the 
curse,  and  the  bestowal  of  blessing.  Wherefore,  O 
Maiden,  called  forth  from  God,  seek,  through  thy 
birth-giving,  safety  to  our  souls  and  Great  Mercy. 

Stichos:  Unto  thy  face  all  the  rich  of  the  nations 
pray. 

Verily,  Anne  the  barren,  the  fruitless,  doth  today  clap 
her  hands  with  joy.  Let  the  terrestrial  ones  enwrap 
themselves  with  light,  let  the  kings  be  happy  and  the 
Priests  rejoice  with  blessings;  let  the  whole  world  cele- 
brate; for  behold  the  queen,  the  blameless  bride  of  the 
Father,  hath  sprouted  from  the  stem  of  Jesse.  Where- 
fore, thereafter,  women  do  not  bring  forth  children  in 
sorrow;  for  joy  hath  blossomed  forth,  and  life  shall 
dwell  in  the  world,  and  the  offerings  of  Joachim  shall 
no  more  be  rejected;  for  the  wailing  of  Anne  hath  been 
turned  into  joy,  who  saith,  Rejoice  with  me,  all  ye 
chosen  of  Israel;  for  the  Lord  hath  given  me  the  living 
palace  of  his  divine  glory  for  universal  joy  and  glad- 
ness, and  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls.

/^^OME,  all  ye  believers,  let  us  hasten  to  the  Virgin; 
^-^  for  behold  she  who  was  forechosen  a  Mother  to 
our  God  before  she  was  conceived  in  the  womb,  was  of 
the  stem  of  Jesse.  Yea,  she  who  is  the  treasure  of  vir- 
ginity, the  budding  rod  of  Aaron,  the  gospel  of  the 


288  Menaion 

Prophets,  and  branch  of  Joachim  and  Anne  the  right- 
eous ones,  is  now  given  birth.  Verily,  the  world  hath 
been  renewed  by  her.  She  is  born,  and  the  Church 
shall  be  adorned  in  her  splendour,  who  is  the  holy 
temple  and  the  vessel  of  the  Godhead,  the  stay  of 
virginity  and  the  kingly  chamber,  through  whom  the 
strange  mystery  of  the  union  of  the  two  Natures  of 
Christ  hath  come  about,  whom  we  worship,  praising 
the  blameless  nativity  of  the  Virgin.

forth  the  Virgin,  of  whom  was  born  Christ  the  Creator,

^^ERILY,  virginity,  O  Theotokos,  is  impossible  for 
a  mother,  as  birth-giving  is  impossible  for  virgins. 
Yet  in  thee  hath  the  dispensation  of  both  been  accom- 
plished. Wherefore,  all  we  families  of  the  earth  cease- 
lessly bless  thee. 

Thou  hast  achieved,  O  Theotokos,  the  promise  of 
the  birth-giving,  as  worthy  of  thy  purity;  for  thou  didst 
bestow  on  her  who  was  fruitless  a  flourishing  fruit  from 
God.  Wherefore,  we  nations  of  the  earth  ceaselessly 
bless  thee.

in  thee,  O  thou  in  whom  all  the  sod  of  humanity  hath 
been  renewed  in  form,  a  body  unto  God. 

O  Theotokos,  as  we  adore  thy  swaddling  clothes,  we 
glorify  him  who  gave  fruit  to  the  barren;  who  in  a 
strange  way  opened  an  unproductive  womb;  for  he  doth 
what  he  willeth,  since  he  is  God  ruling  over  all.

O  Anne  of  divine  mind,  mother  of  the  bride,  thou 
hast  produced  from  thy  womb  unexpectedly,  after  the

fruit  from  God  the  goodness  of  purity.  Wherefore,  we 
all  beatify  thee,  since  thou  art  the  origin  of  our  life.

O  how  strange,  how  wonderful,  that  the  fruit  of  the 
barren  one  did  shine  by  the  direction  of  the  Omnipo- 
tent, the  Creator  of  all;  he  who  in  good  and  righteous 
steadfastness  did  loosen  the  barrenness  of  the  world.

thee,  who  granteth  the  world,  through  thee,  the  Great 
Mercy.

292  Menaion 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Phillippians 

(2:5-11) 

VT'E  brethren:  Let  this  mind  be  in  you,  which  was  also 
■■■    in  Jesus  Christ. 

Who  being  in  the  form  of  God,  thought  it  not  robbery 
to  be  equal  with  God  : 

But  emptied  himself,  taking  upon  him  the  form  of  a 
servant,  and  being  made  in  the  likeness  of  man:  and  in 
habit  found  as  a  man. 

He  humbled  himself,  becoming  obedient  unto  death, 
even  to  the  death  of  the  cross. 

For  which  cause  God  also  hath  exalted  him,  and 
given  him  a,  name  which  is  above  all  names: 

That  at  the  name  of  Jesus  every  knee  should  bow,  of 
those  that  are  in  heaven,  on  earth,  and  under  the  earth; 

And  that  every  tongue  should  confess  that  the  Lord 
Jesus  Christ  is  in  the  glory  of  God  the  Father. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (10:38  to  end;  11:27-28) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  entered  a  certain  town:  and  a 
certain  woman  named  Martha,  received  him  into 
her  house. 

And  she  had  a  sister  called  Mary,  who  sitting  also  at 
the  Lord's  feet,  heard  his  word. 

But  Martha  was  busy  about  much  serving.  Who  stood 
and  said :  Lord,  hast  thou  no  care  that  my  sister  hath 
left  me  alone  to  serve?  speak  to  her  therefore,  that  she 
help  me. 

And  the  Lord  answering,  said  to  her:  Martha, 
Martha,  thou  art  careful,  and  art  troubled  about  many 
things : 

But  one  thing  is  necessary.  Mary  hath  chosen  the 
best  part,  which  shall  not  be  taken  away  from  her. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  spoke  these  things,  a  cer- 
tain woman  from  the  crowd,  lifting  up  her  voice,  said 
to  him :  Blessed  is  the  womb  that  bore  thee,  and  the  paps 
that  gave  thee  suck.

^npHE  Cross  by  its  elevation  calleth  the  whole  creation 
-^  to  praise  the  pure  Passion,  the  Passion  of  him  who 
was  elevated  thereon;  for  having  slain  thereupon  him 
who  had  slain  us,  he  brought  to  life  us  who  had  been 
slain,  and  adorned  us  and  made  us  worthy  to  dwell  in 
the  heavens,  for  the  excess  of  his  goodness;  for  he  is 
compassionate.  Whereupon,  with  rejoicing  we  exalt 
his  Name  and  magnify  his  infinite  condescension.

strivers,  the  adornment  of  the  Apostles,  the  succour  of

deceit  of  food  and  carried  headlong  to  death.  Where-

a^Then  after  the  daily  Prokeimenoji,  the  following  Prophecies  are 
recited. 


First  Reading:  from  Exodus  (15:22  to  end;  and  16:1) 

A  ND  Moses  brought  Israel  from  the  Red  Sea,  and 
they  went  forth  into  the  wilderness  of  Sur:  and 
they  marched  three  days  through  the  wilderness,  and 
found  no  water. 

And  they  came  into  Mara,  and  they  could  not  drink 
the  waters  of  Mara,  because  they  were  bitter:  where- 
upon he  gave  a  name  also  agreeable  to  the  place,  call- 
ing it  Mara,  that  is  bitterness. 

And  the  people  murmured  against  Moses,  saying: 
What  shall  we  drink? 

But  he  cried  to  the  Lord,  and  he  shewed  him  a  tree, 
which  when  he  had  cast  into  the  waters,  they  were 
turned  into  sweetness.  There  he  appointed  him  ordi- 
nances, and  judgments,  and  there  he  proved  him. 

Saying:  If  thou  wilt  hear  the  voice  of  the  Lord  thy 
God,  and  do  what  is  right  before  him,  and  obey  his 
commandments,  and  keep  all  his  precepts,  none  of  the 
evils  that  I  laid  upon  Egypt,  will  I  bring  upon  thee: 
for  I  am  the  Lord  thy  healer. 

And  the  children  of  Israel  came  into  Elim,  where 
there  were  twelve  fountains  of  water,  and  seventy 
palm  trees:  and  they  encamped  by  the  waters. 

And  they  set  forward  from  Elim,  and  all  the  multi- 
tude of  the  children  of  Israel  came  into  the  desert  of 
Sin,  which  is  between  Elim  and  Sinai. 


296  Menaion 

Second  Reading:  from  the  Proverbs  of  Solomon  the 
Wise  (3:11-18) 

lYT"^  son,  reject  not  the  correction  of  the  Lord:  and 
^    ^  do  not  faint  when  thou  art  chastised  by  him; 

For  whom  the  Lord  loveth,  he  chastiseth :  and  as  a 
father  in  the  son  he  pleaseth  himself. 

Blessed  is  the  man  that  findeth  wisdom  and  is  rich  in 
prudence : 

The  purchasing  thereof  is  better  than  the  merchan- 
dise of  silver,  and  her  fruit  than  the  chiefest  and  purest 
gold. 

She  is  more  precious  than  all  riches :  and  all  the 
things  that  are  desired,  are  not  to  be  compared  with  her. 

Length  of  days  is  in  her  right  hand,  and  in  her  left 
hand  riches  and  glory. 

Her  ways  are  beautiful  ways,  and  all  her  paths  are 
peaceable. 

She  is  a  tree  of  life  to  them  that  lay  hold  on  her :  and 
he  that  shall  retain  her  is  blessed. 

Third  Reading :  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  the 

Prophet  (60:11-16) 

nPHESE  things  saith  the  Lord,  And  thy  gates  shall 

shall  be  opened  continually:  they  shall  not  be  shut 

day  nor  night,  that  the  strength  of  the  Gentiles  may  be 

brought  to  thee,  and  their  kings  may  be  brought. 

For  the  nation  and  the  kin^fdom  that  will  not  serve 
thee,  shall  perish:  and  the  Gentiles  shall  be  wasted 
with  desolation. 

The  glory  of  Libanus  shall  come  to  thee,  the  fir  tree, 
and  the  box  tree,  and  the  pine  tree  together,  to  beautify 
the  place  of  my  sanctuary:  and  I  will  glorify  the  place 
of  my  feet. 

And  the  children  of  them  that  afflict  thee,  shall  come 
bowing  down  to  thee,  and  all  that  slandered  thee  shall 
worship  the  steps  of  thy  feet,  and  shall  call  thee  the 
citv  of  the  Lord,  the  Sion  of  the  Holy  One  of  Israel. 

Because  thou  wast  forsaken,  and  hated,  and  there  was 
none  that  passed  through  thee,  I  will  make  thee  to  be 


September  14 — Elevation  of  the  Cross        297 

an  everlasting  glory,  a  joy  unto  generation  and  genera- 
tion: 

And  thou  shalt  suck  the  milk  of  the  Gentiles,  and 
thou  shalt  be  nursed  with  the  breasts  of  kings:  and  thou 
shalt  know  that  I  am  the  Lord  thy  Saviour,  and  thy 
Redeemer,  the  mighty  One  of  Jacob. 

^And  after  the  usual  Petitions,  the  following  Litiya,  in  the  Eighth 
Tone. 

Vt/^HEN  Moses,  O  Christ,  foreshadowed  the  effect 
of  thy  precious  Cross,  he  defeated  the  stubborn 
Amalek  in  the  wilderness  of  Sinai;  for  when  he  lifted 
his  hands,  making  the  sign  of  the  cross,  the  people  pre- 
vailed. But  now  things  have  attained  their  perfection 
in  us.  Today,  as  the  Cross  is  elevated,  evil  spirits  are 
driven  away;' today  the  whole  creation  is  delivered  from 
corruption;  for  by  the  Cross  all  gifts  have  shone  forth 
upon  us.  Wherefore,  we  all  kneel  to  thee,  saying  with 
joy,  How  great  are  thy  works,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee.

corruption  hath  been  abolished  and  incorruption  made 
to  flourish,  and  we  men  have  been  deified,  but  Satan 
was  completely  crushed.  Wherefore,  today  as  we  be-

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Third  Tope 

JOSHUA  the  son  of  Nun,  O  my  Saviour,  in  ancient

therefore,  came  from  heaven.  I  have  both  glori- 
fied it,  and  will  glorify  it  again. 

The  multitude  therefore  that  stood  and  heard,  said 
it  thundered.    Others  said:  An  angel  spoke  to  him. 

Jesus  answered,  and  said:  This  voice  came  not  be- 
cause of  me,  but  for  your  sakes. 


300  Menaion 

Now  is  the  judgment  of  the  world:  noAv  shall  the 
prince  of  this  world  be  cast  out. 

And  I,  if  I  be  lifted  up  from  the  earth,  will  draw  all 
things  to  myself. 

(Now  this  he  said,  signifying  what  death  he  should 
die.) 

The  multitude  answered  him:  We  have  heard  out  of 
the  law,  that  Christ  abideth  for  ever;  and  how  sayest 
thou:  The  Son  of  man  must  be  lifted  up?  Who  is  this 
Son  of  man? 

Jesus  therefore  said  to  them:  Yet  a  little  while,  the 
light  is  among  you.  Walk  whilst  you  have  the  light, 
that  the  darkness  overtake  you  not.  And  he  that  walketh 
in  darkness,  knoweth  not  whither  he  goeth.

7.  The  mad  command  of  the  infidel  tyrant  hath  sha-

loathed  of  God.  But  the  three  youths  were  not  terri- 
fied by  the  bestial  terror,  nor  the  consuming  fire;  for 
being  together  amidst  the  fire  blown  forth  by  a  dewv 
breeze,  they  were  singing,  O  thou  exceedingly  praised, 
blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

Let  us  praise,  bless,  and  worship  the  Lord. 

8.  O  ye  youths,  enual  in  number  to  the  Trinity,  ble'^>s

to  all  for  evermore. 

^Then  instead  of  O  thou  who  art  more  honourable,  etc.,  the  fol- 
lowing Ninth  Ode  with  its  Hermos  is  sung  in  the  Eighth  Tone.

9.  Thou  art  the  mystical  paradise,  O  Theotokos ;  for 
that  thou,  being  untilled,  didst  bud  forth  Christ,  by 
whom  was  planted  on  earth  the  life-giving  tree  of  the 
Cross.  Wherefore,  as  we  adore  it  being  elevated,  we 
magnify  thee. 

Let  all  the  trees  of  the  wood,  planted  from  the  begin- 
ning of  time,  rejoice;  for  their  nature  hath  been  sancti- 
fied by  the  stretching  of  Christ  on  the  Tree.  Where- 
fore, now,  we  worship  him,  lifted  up,  and  magnify  him. 

A  noble  horn  hath  been  raised  to  those  of  divine 
mind,  the  Cross  which  is  head  of  all,  by  which  all  the 
supersensuous  horns  of  sinners  are  crushed.  Where- 
fore now,  we  adore  it  elevated,  and  magnify  it. 

Another  Hermos 

^\TERILY^  death  which  befell  the  human  race  by  eat- 
ing from  the  tree,  hath  been  abolished  today  by  the 
Cross;  for  the  curse  of  the  first  mother  and  all  her  de- 
scendents  hath  been  undone  by  him  who  was  born  of 
the  undefiled  Theotokos,  whom  all  the  powers  of  heaven 
do  magnify.  , 

O  Lord,  that  thou  mightest  not  leave  the  bitterness 
of  the  tree  abolished,  thou  didst  remove  it  completely 
by  the  Cross.  Wherefore,  in  ancient  times  the  tree 
made  the  waters  of  Marah  sweet,  anticipating  the  act 
of  the  Cross,  whom  all  the  powers  of  heaven  do  mag- 
nify. 

O  Lord,  today  by  the  Cross  thou  hast  lifted  up  us 
who  are  immersed  continually  in  the  darkness  of  our 
first  parent;  for  as  nature  fell  aforetime  into  error  per- 
versely, the  light  of  thy  Cross  did  lead  aright  all  us 
who  believe,  and  we  magnify  it. 

O  Lord,  that  thou  mightest  make  plain  to  the  world 
the  sign  of  thy  Cross,  adored  since  it  is  glorified  of  all, 
thou  didst  trace  it  in  the  sky,  sparkling  with  shining 
lieht,  an  invincible  and  perfect  weapon  to  the  kins:. 
Wherefore,  all  the  powers  of  the  heavens  do  magnify  it. 

^Then  close  with  the  two  preceding  Hermoses, 


September  14 — Elevation  of  the  Cross         303 

Exaposteilarion,  to  be  sung  tivo  times 

nPIIE  Cross  is  the  preserver  of  all  the  universe.  The 
Cross  is  the  comeliness  of  the  Church.  The  Cross 
is  the  might  of  kings.  The  Cross  is  the  steadfastness 
of  believers.  The  Cross  is  the  glory  of  the  angels  and 
the  sting  of  Satan. 

Another,  to  be  sung  only  once 

T~^ODAY  the  Cross  is  elevated  and  the  world  sancti- 
fied; for  thou  who  sitteth  with  the  Father  and  the 
Holy  Spirit,  when  thou  didst  stretch  thy  hands  thereon, 
didst  draw  the  whole  world  to  thy  knowledge.  Make 
worthy,  therefore,  of  thy  divine  glory  those  who  rely 
on  thee. 

CThen  in   the  Einos,   the  following  Prosomia  are   chanted  in   the 
Eighth  Tone. 

X-TOW  Strangely  wonderful  that  the  life-bearing 
plant,  the  all-holy  Cross,  appeareth  today  lifted  on 
high;  and  all  quarters  glorify  it,  and  all  evil  spirits 
tremble  thereat.  O  what  a  boon  granted  mankind! 
Wherefore,  O  Christ,  save  our  souls;  for  thou  alone 
art  compassionate.     {Repeat.) 

How  strangely  wonderful  that  the  Cross  which  bore 
the  high  One  as  a  cluster  of  grapes  full  of  life,  appear- 
eth today  elevated  from  the  earth,  through  which  we 
were  all  drawn  to  God,  and  death  was  swallowed  unto 
the  end.  O  what  a  pure  Tree  through  which  we  have 
received  the  non-mortifying  food  of  ETden,  glorifying 
Christ. 

How  strangely  wonderful  that  the  Cross  appeared 
equalling  heaven  in  length  and  breadth,  sanctifying  all 
things  with  divine  grace,  through  which  barbarian  na- 
tions were  conquered,  and  the  scepters  of  kings  were 
established!  What  a  divine  ladder  over  which  we 
ascend  to  the  heavens,  raising  with  praises  Christ  the 
Lord.

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

npODAY  arriveth  the  Cross  of  the  Lord,  and  believ- 
ers receive  it  eagerly,  acquiring  therefrom  healing 
of  soul  and  body  and  every  sickness.  Let  us,  therefore, 
welcome  it  with  joy  and  fear — with  fear  because  of  sin, 
being  unworthy;  with  joy  because  of  the  salvation 
which  Christ,  who  was  nailed  thereon  and  who  pos- 
sesseth  the  Great  Mercy,  granted  to  the  world. 

C^Then,  the  Great  Doxology;  and,  as  the  Choir  singeth,  Holy  God, 
the  Procession  of  the  Precious  Cross  taketh  place  in  the  following 
order:  The  minstering  Priest  approaching  the  altar,  censeth  the  pre- 
cious cross,  then  placeth  it  on  his  head  in  a  tray  filled  with  blosso?7i- 
ing  twigs.  Then  emerging  from  the  northern  door  of  the  Temple,  pre- 
ceded by  taper  carriers,  fan  carriers,  and  the  Choir  singing.  Holy 
God,  the  procession  moveth  to  the  center  of  the  church,  as  the  Deacon 
censes  the  cross.  Having  reached  the  center,  the  Priest  maketh  the 
circuit  three  times  around  a  square  table  placed  there  for  that  pur- 
pose. Then  turning  eastward  he  crieth,  Wisdorri!  Let  us  attend! 
placing  the  precious  cross  on  the  table  and  censing  it  around  in  the 
form  of  a  cross,  as  he  singeth  the  Troparion,  O  Lord,  save  thy  people, 
etc.  {once) ;  and  each  of  the  two  Choirs  sings  it  once.  Then  making 
three  reverences  {on  whatever  day  the  Feast  falleth) ,  the  Priest 
holdeth  the  precious  cross  in  his  hand  with  the  blossoms,  in  front  of 
the  table,  facing  the  east,  and  saith  in  a  loud  voice: 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  according  to  the  mul- 
titude of  thy  mercies.  Of  thee  we  ask;  grant  and  have 
mercy. 

^Then  the  two  Choirs  sing  antiphonally,  ten  at  a  time,  the  first 
hundred  of  Lord,  have  mercy.  As  the  Choirs  begin  singing,  the  Priest 
T7iaketh  the  sign  with  the  precious  cross  three  times,  prostrateth  him- 
self slowly  till  his  head  is  within  one  span  of  touching  the  floor,  then 
he  riseth  slowly  at  the  end  of  the  first  hundred.  Then  moving  to  the 
right  and  looking  northward,  he  saith: 

And  also  we  ask  for  the  sake  of  our  kings  of  true  wor- 
ship, their  victory,  their  preservation,  their  health,  and 
their  salvation. 

^Then  the  Choir  begins  the  second  hundred  of  Lord,  have  mercy, 
as  the  Priest  repeat eth  the  same  acts  as  before.  Then  moving  to  the 
eastern  end  of  the  table  and  looking  westward,  he  saith: 


September  14 — Elevation  of  the  Cross         305 

And  also  we  pray  for  our  Archbishop  (N.  )  and 
all  our  brethren  in  Christ. 

^The  Choir  then  sings  the  third  hundred,  and  the  Priest  repeateth 
the  previous  acts.  At  the  end  the  Priest  moveth  southward  and  look- 
ing towards  the  north,  saith: 

Also  we  pray  for  all  the  Orthodox  Christians,  for 
their  health,  their  salvation,  and  the  forgiveness  of  their 
sins. 

CThe  Choir  then  sings  the  fourth  hundred,  and  the  Priest  repeateth 
the  same  acts.  Then  the  Priest  rcturneth  to  the  place  whence  he 
started,  in  front  of  the  table,  turning  eastward,  as  he  saith: 

And  also  we  pray  for  all  those  who  serve,  and  those 
who  have  served  in  this  holy  Church  of  Christ,  for  their 
health,  their  salvation,  and  the  forgiveness  of  their  sins. 

^The  Choir  sings  the  fifth  hundred,  as  the  Priest  niakcth  the  fifth 
prostration.  After  its  conclusion,  the  Priest  liftefk  the  cross  with  the 
blossoms,  blessing  the  people  by  making  the  si^n  of  the  cross  there- 
with, chanting: 

O  thou  who  of  thine  own  good  will,  upon  the  Cross 
wast  elevated,  etc. 

€l,Then  placing'  the  cross  on  the  table  he  singcth  once: 

Thy  Cross,  our  Master,  we  adore,  and  thy  holy  Res- 
urrection do  we  glorify. 

^This  is  repeated  once  by  each  of  the  two  Choirs. 

^The  Priest  kneels  to  the  cross,  followed  by  the  congregation.  After 
this  the  Priest  distributeth  the  twigs  of  blossoms  among  the  people,  as 
the  Choir  singeth  the  following  Idiomelon,  in  the  Second  Tone. 

/^^OME,  ye  believers,  let  us  adore  the  life-giving  Tree,

thians (1:18-24) 

T)  RETHREN  :  The  word  of  the  cross  to  them  indeed 
^^  that  perish  is  foolishness;  but  to  them  that  are 
saved,  that  is  to  us,  it  is  the  power  of  God. 

For  it  is  written,  I  will  destroy  the  wisdom  of  the 
wise,  and  the  prudence  of  the  prudent  I  will  reject. 

Where  is  the  wise?  where  is  the  scribe?  where  is  the 
disputer  of  this  world? 


September  14 — Elevation  of  the  Cross         307 

For  seeing  that  in  the  wisdom  of  God  the  world  by 
wisdom  knew  not  God,  it  pleased  God  by  the  foolish- 
ness of  our  preaching  to  save  them  that  believe. 

For  the  Jews  require  a  sign,  and  the  Greeks  seek  after 
wisdom: 

But  we  preach  Christ  crucified,  unto  the  Jews  indeed 
a  stumblingblock,  and  unto  the  Gentiles  foolishness; 

But  unto  them  which  are  called  both  Jews  and 
Greeks,  Christ  the  power  of  God,  and  the  wisdom  of 
God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (19:6-35) 

AT  that  time:  All  the  chief  priests  and  ancients  of 
the  people  took  counsel  against  Jesus,  that  they 
might  put  him  to  death. 

And  they  came  to  Pilate,  sayins::  Crucify  him,  cru- 
cify him.  Pilate  saith  to  them:  Take  ye  him  and  cru- 
cify him :  for  I  find  no  cause  in  him. 

The  Tews  answered  him :  We  have  a  law ;  and  accord- 
ing to  the  law  he  ought  to  die,  because  he  made  himself 
the  Son  of  God. 

When  Pilate  therefore  had  heard  this  saying,  he 
feared  the  more. 

And  he  entered  into  the  hall  again,  and  he  said  to 
Tesus:  Whence  art  thou?  But  Jesus  gave  him  no 
answer. 

Pilate  therefore  saith  to  him:  Speakest  thou  not  to 
me?  knowest  thou  not  that  I  have  power  to  crucify 
thee,  and  I  have  power  to  release  thee? 

Jesus  answered :  Thou  shouldst  not  have  any  power 
against  me,  unless  it  were  given  thee  from  above.  There- 
fore, he  that  hath  delivered  me  to  thee,  hath  the  greater 
sin. 

And  from  henceforth  Pilate  sought  to  release  him. 
But  the  Tews  cried  out,  saying:  If  thou  release  this  man, 
thou  art  not  Caesar's  friend.  For  whosoever  maketh 
himself  a  kinp.  speakcth  against  Caesar. 

Now  when  Pilate  had  heard  these  words,  he  brought 
Jesus  forth,  and  sat  down  in  the  judgment  seat,  in  the 


308  Menaion 

place    that    is    called    Lithostrotos,    and    in    Hebrew 
Gabbatha. 

And  it  was  the  parasceve  of  the  pasch,  about  the  sixth 
hour,  and  he  saith  to  the  Jews:  Behold  your  king. 

But  they  cried  out :  Away  with  him ;  away  with  him ; 
crucify  him.  Pilate  saith  to  them  :  Shall  I  crucify  your 
king?  The  chief  priests  answered :  We  have  no  king  but 
Caesar. 

Then  therefore  he  delivered  him  to  them  to  be  cruci- 
fied.   And  they  took  Jesus,  and  led  him  forth. 

And  bearing  his  cross,  he  went  forth  to  that  place 
w^hich  is  called  Calvary,  but  in  Hebrew  Golgotha. 

Where  they  crucified  him,  and  with  him  two  others, 
one  on  each  side,  and  Jesus  in  the  midst. 

And  Pilate  wrote  a  title  also,  and  he  put  it  upon  the 
cross.  And  the  writing  was:  Jesus  of  Nazareth,  the 
King  of  the  Jews. 

This  title  therefore  many  of  the  Jews  did  read:  be- 
cause the  place  where  Jesus  was  crucified  was  nigh  to 
the  city:  and  it  was  written  in  Hebrew,  in  Greek,  and 
in  Latin. 

Then  the  chief  priests  of  the  Jews  said  to  Pilate: 
Write  not.  The  King  of  the  Jews ;  but  that  he  said,  I  am 
the  King  of  the  Jews. 

Pilate  answered:  What  I  have  written,  I  have 
written. 

The  soldiers  therefore,  when  they  had  crucified  him, 
took  his  garments,  (and  they  made  four  parts,  to  every 
soldier  a  part,)  and  also  his  coat.  Now  the  coat  was 
without  seam,  woven  from  the  top  throughout. 

They  said  then  one  to  another:  Let  us  not  cut  it,  but 
let  us  cast  lots  for  it,  whose  it  shall  be;  that  the  scripture 
might  be  fulfilled,  saying:  They  have  parted  my  gar- 
ments amon^  them,  and  upon  my  vesture  they  have  cast 
lots.     And  the  soldiers  indeed  did  these  things. 

Now  there  stood  by  the  cross  of  Jesus,  his  mother, 
and  his  mother's  sister,  Mary  the  wife  of  Cleophas,  and 
Mary  Magdalen. 


September  14 — Elevation  of  the  Cross         309 

When  Jesus  therefore  saw  his  mother  and  the  dis- 
ciple standing  whom  he  loved,  he  saith  to  his  mother: 
Woman,  behold  thy  son. 

After  that,  he  saith  to  the  disciple:  Behold  thy 
mother.  And  from  that  hour,  the  disciple  took  her  to 
his  own. 

Afterwards,  Jesus  knowing  that  all  things  were  now 
accomplished  that  the  scripture  might  be  fulfilled,  said  : 
I  thirst. 

Now  there  was  a  vessel  set  there  full  of  vinegar.  And 
they,  putting  a  sponge  full  of  vinegar  about  hyssop,  put 
it  to  his  mouth. 

Jesus  therefore,  when  he  had  taken  the  vinegar,  said: 
It  is  consummated.  And  bowing  his  head,  he  gave  up 
the  spirit. 

Then  the  Jews,  (because  it  was  the  parasceve,)  that 
the  bodies  might  not  remain  upon  the  cross  on  the  sab- 
bath day,  (for  that  was  a  great  sabbath  day,)  besought 
Pilate  that  their  legs  might  be  broken,  and  that  they 
mieht  be  taken  away. 

The  soldiers  therefore  came;  and  they  broke  the  legs, 
of  the  first,  and  of  the  other  that  was  crucified  with  him, 

But  after  they  were  come  to  Jesus,  when  they  saw  that 
he  was  already  dead,  they  did  not  break  his  legs. 

But  one  of  the  soldiers  with  a  spear  opened  his  side, 
and  immediately  there  came  out  blood  and  water. 

And  he  that  saw  it,  hath  given  testimony;  and  his 
testimony  is  true.  And  he  knoweth  that  he  saith  true; 
that  you  also  may  believe.

SUNDAY  OF  THE  HOLY  FATHERS 

^From  the  eleventh  to  the  seventeenth  of  October,  on  whichever  day 
Sunday  falleth,  shall  be  chanted  the  service  of  the  Fathers  of  the 
Seventh  Council  convened  for  the  second  time  in  Nicea,  in  the  year 
787 ,  against  the  Iconoclasts. 


312  Menaion 

1.    Vespers 

^On  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  are  chanted  four  for  the  Resur- 
rectiofi^  in  the  Tone  in  use^  and  six  for  the  Fathers,  in  the  Sixth 
Tone. 

'X/'ERILY,  the  seven  councils  of  the  Fathers  held  at 
sundry  times,  were  brought  together  under  the 
canon  and  in  good  order  by  the  Patriarch  Germanus 
the  New,  inscribing  and  establishing  their  doctrines 
and  offering  themselves  as  intercessors  with  the  Lord, 
watchful  for  salvation,  and  shepherds  with  him  of 
the  fold. 

The  Book  of  the  Law  hath  verily  honoured  the 
seventh  day  for  the  Hebrews,  dispersed  in  the  shadow 
and  devoted  thereto.  But  ye  Fathers,  by  your  partici- 
pation in  the  Seven  Councils,  by  the  inspiration  of 
God  who  in  six  days  finished  this  universe  and  blessed 
the  seventh  day,  have  made  it  even  more  honourable 
by  decreeing  the  bounds  of  faith. 

Ye  have  given  all,  O  thrice-blessed  Fathers,  to  know 
the  Trinity  clearly  by  his  works,  he  being  the  Cause  of 
the  creation  of  the  world;  for  by  your  mystical  speech, 
having  called  first  three  Councils  then  four,  ye  have 
appeared  as  champions  of  the  Orthodox  word,  proving 
that  the  Trinity  is  verily  the  Creator  of  the  four  ele- 
ments and  of  the  world. 

It  would  have  sufficed  Elisha  the  Prophet  to  bend 
but  once  to  instill  life  in  the  dead  son  of  the  servant; 
but  he  kneeled  and  bent  seven  times.  Thus  in  his  fore- 
vision  did  he  prophesy  your  gathering  wherewith  ye 
revived  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  of  God,  morti- 
fying Arius  and  his  co-workers. 

In  wisdom,  O  venerable  Fathers,  ye  patched  the  rai- 
ment of  Christ,  torn  by  barking  dogs;  for  ye  could 
not  possibly  bear  to  see  his  nakedness,  like  Shem  and 
Janheth.  who  of  old  could  not  bear  to  see  the  nakedness 
of  their  father,  thus  confounding  him  who  smote  his 
own  father,  namely  Arius,  styled  the  fool,  and  those 
who  followed  his  doctrines. 


October  11-1 7— Holy  Fathers  3 1 3 

The  Macedonians,  the  Nestorians,  the  followers  of 
Ephtechnis,  Dioscorus,  Appolonarius,  Sabelius,  and 
Severus,  having  turned  devouring  wolves  in  lambs' 
skins,  ye  did  expel  from  the  Saviour's  fold,  ye  who  are 
true  shepherds.  Verily,  ye  did  well,  stripping  the 
thrice-wretched  ones  naked;  wherefore,  we  beatify  you. 

Glory y  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

T  ET  us  extol  today  those  mystical  trumpets  of  the 
^^  Spirit,  namely  the  God-mantled  Fathers,  who, 
speaking  of  divine  things,  sang  in  the  midst  of  the 
Church  a  hymn  of  unified  tones,  teaching  that  the 
Trinity  is  One,  not  differing  in  Substance  or  Godhead, 
.refuting  Arius  and  contending  for  Orthodoxy,  who  ever 
intercede  with  the  Lord  to  have  mercy  on  our  souls. 

^Now,  in  the  Tone  in  use;  the  Aposticha  for  the  Resurrection;  and 
Glory,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

/^^OME,  ye  assemblies  of  Orthodoxy,  let  us  celebrate 
^^  today  in  faith  and  true  worship  the  anniversary  of 
the  God-mantled  Fathers,  who  from  the  whole  inhab- 
ited world  came  together  in  the  splendid  city  of  Nicea; 
for  those  in  the  sagacity  of  their  pious  minds  did  refute 
the  impious  belief  which  Arius  the  wretched  had  in- 
vented, banishing  him  by  a  decree  of  the  Council  from 
the  universal  Church,  and  instructing  all  to  confess 
openly  the  Son  of  God,  that  he  is  consubstantial  and 
coeternal  with  the  Father  before  eternity,  decreeing  the 
same  with  precision  and  true  worship  in  the  Canon  of 
Faith.  Wherefore,  following  their  divine  doctrines  in 
true  faith,  let  us  worship  with  the  Father  and  the  Son 
the  most  Holy  Spirit,  a  Trinity  consubstantial  in  one 
Godhead. 

Now  to  our  Lady 

T    END  ear,  O  all-blameless  one,  to  the  petitions  of 

thy  servants.    Turn  away  from  us  evil  uprisings  and

thee  in  faith,  saying.  Rejoice,  O  Lady,  the  help  of  all, 
O  joy,  shelter,  and  salvation  of  our  souls.

The  Exaposteilarions  for  the  Resurrection  and  for  the 

Fathers 

r\  FATHERS  of  heavenly  minds,  assembled  together 
in  the  Seventh  Council,  lift  up  your  petitions  con- 
stantly to  the  Trinity  to  save  from  every  heresy  and 
from  eternal  condemnation  those  who  laud  your  divine 
gathering,  that  they  may  receive  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 
By  the  intercessions  of  thy  Mother  and  those  of  the 
Fathers,  who  were  assembled  in  the  Seven  Councils, 
O  Lord  of  exceeding  goodness,  establish  thou  thy 
Church,  confirm  the  Faith,  and  make  us  all  partners  of 
the  kingdom  of  heaven,  when  thou  comest  to  earth  to 
judge  the  whole  creation. 

C^Jnd  in  the  Einos,  sing  four  for  the'  Resurrection  and  four  for  the 
Fathers,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 

l-JAVING  indited  the  whole  knowledge  of  the  soul 
and  considered  it  carefully  in  the  Holy  Spirit,  the 
venerable,  glorified,  and  all-blessed  Fathers  inscribed 
in  divine  writing  the  honourable  and  heavenly  Canon, 
in  which  they  clearly  teach  that  the  Word  is  coeternal 
and  consubstantial  with  the  Father,  thus  following  un- 
mistakably the  teachings  of  the  Apostles.     (Repeat.) 


October  11-1 7— Holy  Fathers  3 1 5 

When  the  blessed  Christ-preachers  received  wholly 
the  torch  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  they  spoke  with  divine  in- 
tuition, with  supernatural  inspiration  of  few  words  and 
much  meaning,  bringing  to  the  front  the  evangelical 
doctrines  and  traditions  of  true  worship,  which,  when 
they  were  clearly  revealed  to  them  from  on  high,  they 
were  iluminated  therewith,  establishing  the  Faith  they 
had  received  from  God. 

Verily,  the  divine  shepherds,  being  favoured  ser- 
vants of  God  and  all-honoured  initiates  of  the  divine 
preaching,  having  attained  fully  the  experience  of  shep- 
herding, and  having  now  most  justly  waxed  wroth,  in  a 
judgment  of  truth,  expelled  from  the  perfection  of  the 
Church  the  devouring,  destructive  wolves,  and  stoned 
them  with  the  sling-shot  of  the  Spirit.  Wherefore,  they 
fell  as  unto  death ;  for  they  were  blighted  with  an  incur- 
able disease. 

Glory,  in  the  Eigth  Tone 

V\/HEN  the  rank  of  the  holy  Fathers  flocked  from 
the  ends  of  the  inhabited  world,  they  believed  in 
one  Substance  and  one  Nature  of  the  Father,  Son,  and 
Holy  Spirit,  delivering  plainly  to  the  Church  the  mys- 
tery of  discoursing  in  theology.  Wherefore,  in  that  we 
laud  them  in  faith,  we  beatify  them,  saying.  What  a 
divine  army,  ye  God-inspired  soldiers  of  the  camp  of 
the  Lord,  ye  most  brilliant  luminaries  in  the  supersensu- 
ous  firmament,  ye  impregnable  towers  of  the  mystical 
Zion,  ye  scented  flowers  of  paradise,  the  golden  lights 
of  the  Word,  the  price  and  delight  of  the  whole  uni- 
verse, intercede  ceaselessly  for  our  souls.

^On  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sing  six  Prosomia  for  the  Saint, 
in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

ILJOW  Strangely  wondrous  that  today  hath  shone  forth 
delight  in  heaven  and  on  earth  in  memory  of  Deme- 
trius the  Martyr;  for  verily  he  is  crowned  with  songs  of 
praise  from  the  angels  and  receiveth  paeans  from  men. 
What  a  contender!  Who  fought  the  good  fight,  and 
through  whom  the  deceitful  enemy  did  fall,  overcome 
for  Christ. 

How  strangely  wondrous  that  Demetrius  doth  ever 
shine  in  all  quarters  of  the  earth  with  rays  of  miracles 
more  brilliant  than  the  light  of  the  sun,  receiving  light 
from  the  Light  that  is  succeeded  not  by  night,  delight- 


318  Menaion 

ing  in  the  Light  that  scttcth  not,  by  whose  illumination 
the  clouds  of  barbarism  were  cleared  away,  diseases  dis- 
persed, and  the  Satans  vanquished. 

How  strangely  wondrous  that,  when  the  thrice-bea- 
tified Demetrius  was  pierced  for  Christ's  sake,  he  was 
ever  manifest  as  a  sword  of  double  edge  to  his  enemies, 
reaping  therewith  the  haughtiness  of  his  enemies,  and 
destroying  the  attacks  of  Satan.  Wherefore,  let  us 
acclaim  him,  saying,  O  Saint  Demetrius,  fold  us  in 
thy  protection,  who  celebrate  thy  ever-honoured 
memory. 

Thou  hast  become  a  tower  of  true  worship,  securely 
founded  on  the  rock  of  faith,  uncloven  by  temptations 
and  unshaken  by  tribulations;  for  when  the  waves  of 
atheism  dashed  against  thee  in  a  great  torrent  and  tem- 
pest, they  did  not  break  down  thine  indomitable  stead- 
fastness; for  thou  didst  desire  to  be  adorned  with  the 
crown  of  martyrdom. 

O  fight-bearing  Demetrius,  having  resembled  in  thy 
passion  the  enlivening  Passion  of  Christ,  thou  didst  re- 
ceive from  him  the  gift  of  wonder-working.  Where- 
fore, thou  dost  save  those  who  hasten  to  thee,  saving 
them  from  many  tribulations;  for  thou  art,  O  glorious 
one,  well  favoured  by  Christ,  before  whom  thou  stand- 
est  all  the  day,  full  of  glory. 

By  the  shedding  of  thy  blood,  O  Demetrius,  thou 
didst  come  before  the  life-giving  Christ,  who  shed  his 
own  precious  blood  for  thy  sake,  making  thee  a  par- 
taker in  his  glorv  and  his  kingdom,  since  thou  didst 
prevail  over  the  iniouitous  one,  annulling  all  his  evil 
wiles.

Christ.  Wherefore,  O  Demetrius,  the  comeliness  of 
strugglers,  beseech  him  to  save  us  from  our  invisible 
enemies,  and  to  save  our  souls.

now,  O  good  one,  to  plead  with  thy  Son  our  Lord,  O 
Theotokos,  for  us  despairing  sinners;  for  thou  art  able 
thus  to  do  by  using  thv  maternal  privilege  with  him. 
Apprehend  us,  O  undefiled  one,  apprehend  us,  mediate 
and  save  thy  people  from  the  pending  threat.  And  for 
the  compassion  of  thy  mercies,  turn  not  away  those  who 
praise  thee.

By  Germanus 

/^HRIST  God,  O  wise  Martyr  Demetrius,  did  offer 
thy  blameless  soul  unto  abodes  more  sublime  than 
earth;  for  thou  didst  become  a  contender  for  the  Trin- 
ity, taking  to  the  battlefield  with  fortitude  adamantine 
as  a  diamond;  and  when  thy  pure  side  was  pierced,  O 
most  venerable  one,  resembling  him  who  was  stretched 
on  the  Tree  for  the  salvation  of  the  whole  world,  thou 
didst  receive  the  gift  of  miracle-working,  granting  man- 
kind healing  with  bounty.  Wherefore,  as  we  celebrate 
today  thy  conveyance  as  is  meet,  we  glorify  the  Lord 
who  glorified  thee.

By  Simeon 

\X7HEN  the  earth  trembled  because  of  the  fear  of 
thy  wrath,  O  Lord,  the  hills  and  mountains  shook. 
Wherefore,  as  thou  lookest  down  upon  us  with  thine 
eye  of  compassion,  be  not  indignant  with  us  in  thy 
wrath,  but  have  compassion  on  the  creation  of  thy 
hands,  and  deliver  us  from  the  fearful  threat  of  earth- 
quakes; for  thou  art  good  and  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:  Thou  hast  moved  the  earth  and  thou  hast 
troubled  it. 

Thou  art  awesome,  O  Lord;  who  can  bear  thy 
just  wrath?  Who  shall  beseech  thee,  or  who  shall 
implore  thee,  O  good  One,  on  behalf  of  a  despairing 
and  sinful  people?  Verily,  the  heavenly  myriads,  the 
angels,  principalities,  powers,  thrones,  lords,  the  cheru- 
bim and  seraphim,  cry  to  thee  for  our  sake.  Holy!  Holy! 
Holy!  art  thou,  O  Lord.  Turn  not  away,  O  good  One, 
from  the  works  of  thy  hands;  but  by  the  compassion  of 
thy  mercies  save  a  city  threatened  with  danger. 

Stichos:  He  looketh  upon  the  earth,  and  maketh  it 
tremble. 

The  people  of  Nineveh,  because  of  their  shortcom- 
ings, heard  of  the  threat  of  the  earthquake.  But  bv 
means  of  the  sign  of  the  whale,  which  made  clear  to 
them  the  Resurrection,  they  were  called  to  repentance 
through  Tonah.  Wherefore,  as  thou  didst  hearken  to 
them,  hearken  also  to  the  cries  of  thv  oeople,  with  the 
babes  and  beasts,  and  have  compassion  on  us  who  are 
chastised.  Pity  us  for  the  sake  of  thy  third-day  Resur- 
rection, and  have  mercy  upon  us.

they  will  lay  their  hands  on  you,  and  persecute  you, 
delivering  you  up  to  the  synagogues  and  into  prisons, 
4ragging  you  before  kings  and  governors,  for  my 
name's  sake. 

And  it  shall  happen  unto  you  for  a  testimony. 

Lay  it  up  therefore  in  your  hearts,  not  to  meditate  be- 
fore how  you  shall  answer : 

For  I  will  give  you  a  mouth  and  wisdom,  which  all 
your  adversaries  shall  not  be  able  to  resist  and  gainsay. 

And  you  shall  be  betrayed  by  your  parents  and  breth-

as  a  diamond;  and  when  thy  pure  sude  was  pierced,  O 
most  venerable  one,  resembling  hi  mwho  was  stretched 
on  the  Tree  for  the  salvation  of  the  whole  world,  thou 
didst  receive  the  gift  of  miracle-working,  granting  man-

"LJASTEN  to  us  who  beseech  thee,  O  Martyr  of 
Christ,  by  thy  pitying  visitation.  Deliver  those 
who  are  in  misery  from  the  threatenings  of  usurpers  and 
from  the  vile  folly  of  heretics,  who  persecute  us  like 
naked  captives  ever  driven  from  place  to  place,  wan- 
dering in  caves  and  mountains.  Wherefore,  O  all-ex- 
tolled one,  have  compassion  and  grant  us  rest.  Still  the 
tempest  and  put  down  the  wrath  that  riseth  against  us, 
imploring  God  to  grant  the  world  the  Great  Mercy.

Verily,  thou  hast  been  given  unto  us,  O  Demetrius,  as 
a  fortified  wall  which  feareth  not  the  impacts  of  its 
enemies,  annulling  the  attacks  of  the  Barbarians  and  all 
the  symptoms  of  disease.  Wherefore,  thou  hast  re- 
mained for  thy  city  a  firm  pillar,  an  unshaken  founda- 
tion, a  keeper,  a  leader,  and  a  contender  therefor. 
Wherefore,  since  now  it  is  encompassed  by  danger  and 
pressed  hard  by  misery,  by  thine  intercessions,  O  all- 
blessed  one,  save  it,  imploring  Christ  who  granteth  the 
world  the  Great  Mercy. 

The  rank  of  the  fi^ht-bearing  ones,  was  revealed  as 
possessor  of  every  virtue.  Wherefore,  according  to 
their  worthiness,  they  have  inherited  the  bliss  and  hap- 
piness of  immortal  life.  And  since  thou,  O  Demetrius, 
worthy  of  praise,  dost  enjoy  that  life,  exulting  in  thy 
resemblance  to  Christ,  and  priding  thyself  that  like  him 
thou  wast  pierced  with  a  spear,  therefore  seek  thou 
ceaselessly,  that  we  who  honour  thee,  be  delivered  from 
sufferings  and  severe  hardships,  beseeching  him  fer- 
vently who  doth  grant  the  world  the  Great  Mercy.

T  ET  us  honour  the  all-wise  teacher,  perfected  among 
the  Martyrs,  who  by  the  spear  did  inherit  the  grace 
of  the  saving  side  pierced  by  a  spear,  from  which  the

The  Epistle:  The  just  shall  rejoice  in  the  Lord, 
Hearken,  O  Lord,  to  my  voice. 

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  Timothy 

(2:1-10) 

IV/FY  son  Timohty:  Be  strong  in  the  grace  which  is  in 
^^^  Christ  Jesus. 

And  the  things  which  thou  hast  heard  of  me  by  many 
witnesses,  the  same  commend  to  faithful  men,  who  shall 
be  fit  to  teach  others  also. 

Labour  as  a  good  soldier  of  Christ  Jesus. 

No  man,  being  a  soldier  to  God,  entangleth  himself 
with  secular  business;  that  he  may  please  him  to  whom 
he  hath  engaged  himself. 

For  he  also  that  striveth  for  the  mastery,  is  not 
crowned,  except  he  strive  faithfully. 

The  husbandman,  that  laboureth,  must  first  partake 
of  the  fruits. 

Understand  what  I  say:  for  the  Lord  will  give  thee 
in  all  things  understanding. 


326  Menaion 

Be  mindful  that  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  risen  again 
from  the  dead,  of  the  seed  of  David,  according  to  my 
gospel. 

Wherein  I  labour  even  unto  bands,  as  an  evildoer; 
but  the  word  of  God  is  not  bound. 

Therefore  I  endure  all  things  for  the  sake  of  the  elect, 
that  they  also  may  obtain  the  salvation,  w^hich  is  in 
Christ  Jesus  w^ith  heavenly  glory. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (15:17  to  end;  16:1-2) 

A  ND  the  Lord  said  to  his  disciples:  These  things 
I  command  you,  that  you  love  one  another. 

If  the  vs^orld  hate  you,  know  ye,  that  it  hath  hated 
me  before  you. 

If  you  had  been  of  the  world,  the  world  would  love 
its  own:  but  because  you  are  not  of  the  world,  but  I 
have  chosen  you  out  of  the  world,  therefore  the  world 
hateth  you. 

Remember  my  word  that  I  said  to  you :  The  servant 
is  not  greater  than  his  master.  If  they  have  persecuted 
me,  they  will  also  persecute  you :  if  they  have  kept  my 
word,  they  will  keep  yours  also. 

But  all  these  things  they  will  do  to  you  for  my  name's 
sake :  because  they  know  not  him  that  sent  me. 

If  I  had  not  come,  and  spoken  to  them,  they  would 
not  have  sin;  but  now  they  have  no  excuse  for  their  sin. 

He  that  hateth  me,  hateth  my  Father  also. 

If  I  had  not  done  among  them  the  works  that  no  other 
man  hath  done,  they  would  not  have  sin;  but  now  they 
have  both  seen  and  hated  both  me  and  my  Father. 

But  that  the  word  may  be  fulfilled  which  is  written 
in  their  law:  They  hated  me  without  cause. 

But  when  the  Paraclete  cometh,  whom  I  will  send 
you  from  the  Father,  the  Spirit  of  truth,  who  proceed- 
eth  from  the  Father,  he  shall  give  testimony  of  me. 

And  you  shall  give  testimony,  because  you  are  with 
me  from  the  beginning.

immortal  nature,  fulfilling  the  commands  of  the  All- 
creator,  and  known  as  powerful  by  thy  might.  Verily,

by  thy  sanctified  call. 

O  Lord  the  Word,  who  makest  thine  angels  spirits, 
as  it  is  written,  and  thy  ministers  flames  of  fire,  thou 
hast  manifested  Michael,  the  prince  of  hosts  among  thy 
myriad  archangels,  as  a  leader  submitting  to  thy  com-

C^Then  after  the  Anabathrnoi,  From  my  youth,  etc.  {p.  50) ,  the  fol- 
lowing Prokei?nenon  is  sung. 

Who  makest  thy  angels  spirits:  and  thy  ministers  a 
burning  fire.  Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul,  my  Lord  and 
my  God. 

The  Matin  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (18:10-20) 

'  I  ""HE  Lord  said  to  his  disciples:  See  that  you  despise 
not  one  of  these  little  ones:  for  I  say  to  you,  that 
their  angels  in  heaven  always  see  the  face  of  my  Father 
who  is  in  heaven. 

For  the  Son  of  man  is  come  to  save  that  which  was 
lost. 

What  think  you?  If  a  man  have  an  hundred  sheep, 
and  one  of  them  should  go  astray:  doth  he  not  leave  the 
ninety-nine  in  the  mountains,  and  go  to  seek  that  which 
is  gone  astray? 

And  if  it  so  be  that  he  find  it :  Amen  I  say  to  you,  he 
rejoiceth  more  for  that,  than  for  the  ninety-nine  that 
went  not  astray. 

Even  so  it  is  not  the  will  of  your  Father  who  is  in 
heaven,  that  one  of  these  little  ones  should  perish. 

But  if  thy  brother  shall  offend  against  thee,  go  and 
rebuke  him  between  thee  and  him  alone.  If  he  shall 
hear  thee,  thou  shalt  gain  thy  brother. 

And  if  he  will  not  hear  thee,  take  with  thee  one  or 
two  more :  that  in  the  mouth  of  two  or  three  witnesses 
every  word  may  stand. 

And  if  he  will  not  hear  them:  tell  the  church.  And 
if  he  will  not  hear  the  church,  let  him  be  to  thee  as  the 
heathen  and  publican. 


November  8 — The  Archangels  333 

Amen  I  say  to  you,  whatsoever  you  shall  bind  upon 
earth,  shall  be  bound  also  in  heaven;  and  whatsoever 
you  shall  loose  upon  earth,  shall  be  loosed  also  in 
heaven. 

Again  I  say  to  you,  that  if  two  of  you  shall  consent 
upon  earth,  concerning  any  thing  whatsoever  they  shall 
ask,  it  shall  be  done  to  them  by  my  Father  who  is  in

The  Epistle 

Who  makest  thine  angels  spirits. 
Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 

(2:2-10) 

ORETHREN:  For  if  the  word,  spoken  by  angels, 
^^  be  steadfast,  and  every  transgression  and  disobedi- 
ence received  a  just  recompense  of  reward. 

How  shall  we  escape  if  we  neglect  so  great  a  salva- 
tion? which  having  begun  to  be  declared  by  the  Lord, 
was  confirmed  unto  us  by  them  that  heard  him. 

God  also  bearing  them  witness  by  signs,  and  won- 
ders, and  divers  miracles,  and  distributions  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  according  to  his  own  will. 

For  God  hath  not  subjected  unto  angels  the  world 
to  come,  whereof  we  speak. 

But  one  in  a  certain  place  hath  testified,  saying :  What 
is  man,  that  thou  art  mindful  of  him :  or  the  son  of  man, 
that  thou  visitest  him? 

Thou  hast  made  him  a  little  lower  than  the  angels: 
thou  hast  crowned  him  with  glory  and  honour,  and 
hast  set  him  over  the  works  of  thy  hands: 

Thou  hast  subjected  all  things  under  his  feet.  For 
in  that  he  hath  subjected  all  things  to  him,  he  left  noth- 
ing not  subject  to  him.  But  now  we  see  not  as  yet  all 
things  subject  to  him, 


336  Menaion 

But  we  see  Jesus,  who  was  made  a  little  lower  than 
the  angels,  for  the  suffering  of  death,  crowned  with 
glory  and  honour:  that,  through  the  grace  of  God,  he 
might  taste  death  for  all. 

For  it  became  him,  for  whom  are  all  things,  and  by 
whom  are  all  things,  who  had  brought  many  children 
into  glory,  to  perfect  the  author  of  their  salvation,  by 
his  passion. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (10:16-21) 

^  I  ^HE  Lord  said:  He  that  heareth  you,  heareth  me; 
and  he  that  despiseth  you  despiseth  me;  and  he  that 
despiseth  me,  despiseth  him  that  sent  me. 

And  the  seventy-two  returned  with  joy,  saying:  Lord, 
the  devils  also  are  subject  to  us  in  thy  name. 

And  he  said  to  them:  I  saw  Satan  like  lightning  fall- 
ing from  heaven. 

Behold,  I  have  given  you  power  to  tread  upon  ser- 
pents and  scorpions,  and  upon  all  the  power  of  the 
enemy:  and  nothing  shall  hurt  you. 

But  yet  rejoice  not  in  this,  that  spirits  are  subject 
unto  you;  but  rejoice  in  this,  that  your  names  are  writ- 
ten in  heaven. 

In  that  same  hour,  he  rejoiced  in  the  Holy  Spirit, 
and  said :  I  confess  to  thee,  O  Father,  Lord  of  heaven 
and  earth,  because  thou  hast  hidden  these  things  from 
the  wise  and  prudent,  and  hast  revealed  them  to  little 
ones.  Yea,  Father,  for  so  it  hath  seemed  good  in  thy 
sight.

First  Reading :  from  the  Book  of  Exodus  (40:1-5; 
9-11;  16;  34-35) 

A  ND  the  Lord  spoke  to  Moses  saying: 

"^  The  first  month,  the  first  day  of  the  month,  thou 
shalt  set  up  the  tabernacle  of  the  testimony. 

And  shalt  put  the  ark  in  it,  and  shalt  let  down  the 
veil  before  it: 

And  thou  shalt  bring  in  the  table,  and  set  upon  it  the 
things  that  are  commanded  according  to  the  rite.  The 
candlestick  shall  stand  with  its  lamps, 

And  the  altar  of  gold  whereon  the  incense  is  burnt, 
before  the  ark  of  the  testimony.  Thou  shalt  put  the 
hanging  in  the  entry  of  the  tabernacle, 

And  thou  shalt  take  the  oil  of  unction  and  anoint  the 
tabernacle  with  its  vessels  that  they  may  be  sanctified : 

The  altar  of  holocaust  and  all  its  vessels : 

The  laver  with  its  foot:  thou  shalt  consecrate  all 
with  the  oil  of  unction,  that  they  be  most  holy. 

And  Moses  reared  it  up,  and  placed  the  boards  and 
the  sockets  and  the  bars,  and  set  up  the  pillars. 

If  at  any  time  the  cloud  removed  from  the  tabernacle, 
the  children  of  Israel  went  forward  by  their  troops: 

If  it  hung  over,  they  remained  in  the  same  place. 

Second  Reading :  3  Kings  (7 :51  and  8 :1-11) 

A  ND  Solomon  finished  all  the  work  that  he  made  in 
•^  ^  the  house  of  the  Lord,  and  brought  in  the  things 
that  David  his  father  had  dedicated,  the  silver  and  the 
gold,  and  the  vessels,  and  laid  them  up  in  the  treasures 
of  the  house  of  the  Lord, 


November  21 — Presentation  of  Our  Lady         341 

Then  all  the  ancients  of  Israel  with  the  princes  of  the 
tribes,  and  the  heads  of  the  families  of  the  children  of 
Israel  were  assembled  to  king  Solomon  in  Jerusalem: 
that  they  might  carry  the  ark  of  the  covenant  of  the 
Lord  out  of  the  city  of  David,  that  is,  out  of  Sion. 

And  all  Israel  assembled  themselves  to  king  Solomon 
on  the  festival  day  in  the  month  of  Ethanim,  the  same 
is  the  seventh  month. 

And  all  the  ancients  of  Israel  came,  and  the  priests 
took  up  the  ark. 

And  carried  the  ark  of  the  Lord,  and  the  tabernacle 
of  the  covenant,  and  all  the  vessels  of  the  sanctuary, 
that  were  in  the  tabernacle:  and  the  priests  and  the 
Levites  carried  them. 

And  king  Solomon,  and  all  the  multitude  of  Israel, 
that  were  assembed  unto  him  went  with  him  before  the 
ark,  and  they  sacrificed  sheep  and  oxen  that  could  not 
be  counted  or  numbered. 

And  the  priests  brought  in  the  ark  of  the  covenant 
of  the  Lord  into  its  place,  into  the  oracle  of  the  temple, 
into  the  holy  of  holies  under  the  wings  of  the  cherubims. 

For  the  cherubims  spread  forth  their  wings  over  the 
place  of  the  ark,  and  covered  the  ark,  and  the  staves 
thereof  above. 

And  whereas  the  staves  stood  out,  the  ends  of  them 
were  seen  without  in  the  sanctuary  before  the  oracle, 
but  were  not  seen  farther  out,  and  there  they  have  been 
unto  this  day. 

Now  in  the  ark  there  was  nothing  else  but  the  two 
tables  of  stone,  which  Moses  put  there  at  Horeb,  when 
the  Lord  made  a  covenant  with  the  children  of  Israel, 
when  they  came  out  of  the  land  of  Egypt. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  when  the  priests  were  come  out 
of  the  sanctuary,  that  a  cloud  filled  the  house  of  the 
Lord. 

And  the  priests  could  not  stand  to  minister  because 
of  the  cloud:  for  the  glory  of  the  Lord  had  filled  the 
house  of  the  Lord.

Third  Reading:  Ezekiel  (43:27  and  44:1-4) 

npHESE  things  doth  the  Lord  our  Lord  say:  And  the

forward, the  priests  shall  offer  your  holocausts  upon

And  he  brought  me  back  to  the  way  of  the  gate  of 
the  outward  sanctuary,  which  looked  towards  the  east, 
and  it  was  shut. 

And  the  Lord  said  to  me:  This  gate  shall  be  shut,  it 
shall  not  be  opened,  and  no  man  shall  pass  through  it, 
because  the  Lord  the  God  of  Israel  hath  entered  in  by

be  offered  as  a  vow  for  the  abode  of  the  King  of  all. 
Let,  therefore,  Joachim  the  grandparent,  and  Anne  be

going  forth  to  the  divine  abode  to  be  brought  up  in  a 
noble  manner,  of  whom  Zachariah  cried  in  gladness,  I 
open  to  thee  the  gate  of  the  Temple,  O  gate  of  the

lamps,  saying.  Go  forth,  my  daughter,  to  him  who  gave 
thee  to  me.  Be  thou  to  him  a  vow,  an  incense  of  sweet 
odour.  Enter  thou  unto  the  veiled  ones  and  learn  the

Wherefore,  I  cry  to  thee  gratefully,  Thou  O  spotless

refuge  in  thy  compassion,  who  worship  piously  thy  Son,

ple in  trials,  as  thy  name  implies;  for,  being  called  in 
every  quarter,  thou  didst  hasten  warmly  to  the  assist- 
ance of  those  who  seek  the  shadow  of  thy  protection. 
Wherefore,  appearing  to  them  in  faith  by  day  and  by 
night,  thou  dost  deliver  them  from  trials  and  tribula- 
tions.    {Repeat.) 

Thou  didst  verily  appear  in  a  dream  to  Constantine 
the  king  with  Ablabius,  and  having  put  them  to  fright 
thou  didst  address  them,  saying,  Release  at  once  from 
prison  those  in  chains  whom  ye  have  arrested  unjustly; 
for  they  are  innocent  of  the  law-defying  murder;  and  if 
thou  dost  contradict  me,  O  king,  I  shall  call  upon  the 
Lord  against  thee.    {Repeat.) 

O  glorious  Saint  Nicholas,  the  nobLj  preacher  of 
Christ,  thou  art  a  great  and  fervid  helper  of  those  in 
difficulties,  of  those  who  are  on  land,  and  of  those  who 
are  at  sea,  all-compassionate,  a  precious  intercessor  for 
those  who  are  far  ofif  and  those  who  are  near.  Where- 
fore, in  our  2:athering  we  shout  to  thee  to  intercede  with 
the  Lord,  that  we  be  delivered  from  every  tribulation.

CAID  the  Lord  to  those  of  the  Jews  who  came  unto 
*^him :  I  say  unto  you :  he  that  entereth  not  by  the  door 
into  the  sheepfold,  but  climbeth  up  another  way,  the 
same  is  a  thief  and  robber. 


December  6 — St.  Nicholas  357 

But  he  that  entereth  in  by  the  door  is  the  shepherd  of 
the  sheep. 

To  him  the  porter  openeth ;  and  the  sheep  hear  his 
voice:  and  he  calleth  his  own  sheep  by  name,  and  lead- 
eth  them  out. 

And  when  he  putteth  forth  his  own  sheep,  he  goeth 
before  them,  and  the  sheep  follow  him:  for  they  know 
his  voice. 

But  a  stranger  will  they  not  follow,  but  will  flee  from 
him;  for  they  know  not  the  voice  of  strangers. 

This  proverb  spoke  Jesus  unto  them;  but  they  under- 
stood not  what  he  spoke  unto  them. 

Jesus  therefore  said  to  them  again,  I  say  unto  you,  I 
am  the  door  of  the  sheep. 

All  that  ever  came  before  me  are  thieves  and  rob- 
bers:  but  the  sheep  heard  them  not. 

I  am  the  door:  by  me  if  any  man  enter  in,  he  shall

of  our  souls;  that  they  may  do  this  with  joy,  and  not

the  dead  the  great  pastor  of  the  sheep,  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  in  the  blood  of  the  everlasting  testament. 

Fit  you  in  all  goodness,  that  you  may  do  his  will; 
doing  in  you  that  which  is  well  pleasing  in  his  sight, 
through  Jesus  Christ,  to  whom  is  glory  for  ever  and

spirits,  were  cured. 

And  all  the  multitude  sought  to  touch  him,  for  vir- 
tue went  out  from  him,  and  healed  all. 

And  he,  lifting  up  his  eyes  on  his  disciples,  said: 
Blessed  are  ye  poor,  for  yours  is  the  kingdom  of  God. 

Blessed  are  ye  that  hunger  now  for  you  shall  be  filled. 
Blessed  are  ye  that  weep,  for  you  shall  laugh. 

Blessed  shall  you  be  when  men  shall  hate  you,  and

SUNDAY  OF  THE  HOLY  FOREFATHERS 
From  December  llth-17th 

4lOn  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  are  sung  six  for  the  Resurrec- 
tion and  four  for  the  Forefathers,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

A  S  we  celebrate  today  the  memory  of  the  forefathers, 
^  ^  let  us,  O  believers,  praise  in  faith  Christ  the  Deliv- 
erer who  magnified  them  among  all  nations;  the  Lord 
who  doeth  strange  wonders;  for  he  is  precious  and 
mighty,  who  showeth  us  through  them  a  staff  of 
strength.  She  is  Mary  the  undefiled  Maiden  of  God 
who  alone  knew  no  man,  from  whom  proceeded  Christ 
the  Blossom,  budding  life  for  all,  the  everlasting  Bliss 
and  eternal  Salvation. 

O  Master,  who  didst  rescue  the  holy  youths  from 
fire  and  Daniel  from  the  mouths  of  the  lions,  and  didst 
bless  Abraham,  Isaac  thy  servant,  and  Jacob  his  son, 
O  thou  who  wast  willing  to  become,  like  us,  of  their 
seed,  that  thou  mightest  save  our  forefathers  who  fell 
of  old,  and  to  be  crucified  and  buried  in  order  to  crush 
the  bonds  of  death  and  raise  the  dead  from  eternity, 
we  worship,  O  Christ,  thine  eternal  kingdom. 

The  youths  of  God  walking  forth  amidst  the  flame, 
rejoicing  in  the  dew  of  the  Spirit  as  though  they  were 
in  a  garden,  did  go  before  and  foreshadow  therein  the 
mystery  of  the  Trinity  and  the  Incarnation  of  Christ. 
And  in  that  they  were  wise  men  they  quenched  by  faith 
the  power  of  fire.  And  as  for  Daniel  the  righteous,  he 
did  appear  closing  the  mouths  of  the  lions.  Wherefore, 
by  their  beseechings  we  plead  with  thee,  O  Saviour  and 
Lover  of  mankind,  to  deliver  us  from  the  everlasting 
and  unquenchable  fire,  and  to  make  us  worthy  to  re- 
ceive thy  heavenly  kingdom. 

Thy  holy  youths,  O  Christ,  when  they  were  in  the  fur- 
nace of  fire,  as  though  in  dew,  did  go  before  and  fore- 
shadow mystically  thy  coming  from  the  Virgin,  which 
hath  illuminated  us  without  burning.  And  righteous 
Daniel,  wonderful  among  Prophets,  when  he  went  be-

the  Judge  sat,  and  the  river  of  fire  came  before  him. 
Wherefore,  by  their  beseechings,  O  Master,  deliver  us.

tribes,  David  the  most  meek,  and  Daniel  the  Prophet 
of  desires,  honouring  with  them  the  three,  youths  who 
changed  the  furnace  to  a  dewy  place,  asking  forgiveness

Thou  art  beautiful  above  the  sons  of  men;  grace  is 
poured  abroad  in  thy  lips;  therefore,  hath  God  blessed 
thee  for  ever. 

Gird  thy  sword  upon  thy  thigh,  O  thou  most  mighty. 

With  thy  comeliness  and  thy  beauty  set  out,  proceed 
prosperously,  and  reign. 

Because  of  truth  and  meekness  and  justice:  and  thy 
right  hand  shall  conduct  thee  wonderfully. 

Thy  arrows  are  sharp:  under  thee  shall  people  fall, 
into  the  hearts  of  the  king's  enemies. 

Thy  throne,  O  God,  is  for  ever  and  ever:  the  sceptre 
of  thy  kingdom  is  a  scepter  of  uprightness. 

Thou  hast  loved  justice,  and  hated  iniquity:  therefore 
God,  thy  God,  hath  anointed  thee  with  the  oil  of  glad- 
ness above  thy  fellows. 

Myrrh  and  stacte  and  cassia  perfume  thy  garments, 
from  the  ivory  houses  out  of  which  the  daughters  of 
kings  have  delighted  thee  in  thy  glory. 

The  queen  stood  on  thy  right  hand,  in  gilded  cloth- 
ing; surrounded  with  variety. 

Hearken,  O  daughter,  and  see,  and  incline  thy  ear: 
and  forget  thy  people  and  thy  father's  house. 

And  the  king  shall  greatly  desire  thy  beauty,  for  he 
is  the  Lord  thy  God,  and  him  they  shall  adore. 

And  the  daughters  of  Tyre  with  gifts,  yea,  all  the 
rich  among  the  people,  shall  entreat  thy  countenance. 

All  the  glory  of  the  king's  daughter  is  within  in 
golden  borders,  clothed  round  about  with  varieties. 

After  her  shall  virgins  be  brought  to  the  king:  her 
neighbours  shall  be  brought  to  thee. 

They  shall  be  brought  with  gladness  and  rejoicing: 
they  shall  be  brought  into  the  temple  of  the  king. 

Instead  of  thy  fathers,  sons  are  born  to  thee:  thou 
shalt  make  them  princes  over  all  the  earth. 

They  shall  remember  thy  name  throughout  all  gene- 
rations. 

Therefore  shall  people  praise  thee  for  ever;  yea,  for 
ever  and  ever.

Psalm  45 

/^UR  God  is  our  refuge  and  strength:  a  helper  in 
^^^  troubles,  which  have  found  us  exceedingly. 

Therefore  we  will  not  fear,  when  the  earth  shall  be 
troubled ;  and  the  mountains  shall  be  removed  into  the 
heart  of  the  sea. 

Their  waters  roared  and  were  troubled :  the  moun- 
tains were  troubled  with  his  strength. 

The  stream  of  the  river  maketh  the  city  of  God  joy- 
ful: the  most  High  hath  sanctified  his  own  tabernacle. 
God  is  in  the  midst  thereof,  it  shall  not  be  moved : 
God  will  help  it  in  the  morning  early. 

Nations  were  troubled,  and  kingdoms  were  bowed 
down:  he  uttered  his  voice,  the  earth  trembled. 

The  Lord  of  armies  is  with  us:  the  God  of  Jacob  is 
our  protector. 

Come  and  behold  ye  the  works  of  the  Lord :  what 
wonders  he  hath  done  upon  earth,  making  wars  to  cease 
even  to  the  end  of  the  earth. 

He  shall  destroy  the  bow,  and  break  the  weapons: 
and  the  shield  he  shall  burn  in  the  fire. 

Be  still  and  see  that  I  am  God;  I  will  be  exalted 
among  the  nations,  and  I  will  be  exalted  in  the  earth. 
The  Lord  of  armies  is  with  us:  the  God  of  Jacob  is 
our  protector.

Wherefore,  henceforth  from  this  moment  be  thou 
secluded  in  secret.  What  is  this  matter,  O  Mary,  that 
I  behold  in  thee?  For  thou  hast  given  me  instead  of 
honour,  disgrace;  and  instead  of  gladness,  sorrow;  and 
instead  of  being  extolled,  thou  hast  brought  me  blame. 
Therefore,  I  cannot  bear  the  reproach  of  men,  from 
the  Temple  of  the  Lord  I  took  thee;  from  the  priests 
I  received  thee  as  innocent  of  all  blame.  What  then

T^HESE  things  the  Lord  doth  say:  And  thou,  Beth- 
lehem Ephrata,  art  a  little  one  among  the  thou- 
sands of  Judah:  out  of  thee  shall  he  come  forth  unto 
me  that  is  to  be  the  Ruler  in  Israel :  and  his  going  forth 
is  from  the  beginning,  from  the  days  of  eternity. 

Therefore,  will  he  give  them  up  even  till  the  time 
wherein  she  that  travaileth  shall  bring  forth :  and  the 
remnant  of  his  brethren  shall  be  converted  to  the  chil- 
dren of  Israel. 

And  he  shall  stand,  and  feed  in  the  strength  of  the 
Lord,  in  the  height  of  the  name  of  the  Lord  his  God: 
and  they  shall  be  converted,  for  now  shall  he  be  magni-

Selection  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 

(1:1-12) 

/^^OD,  who  at  sundry  times  and  in  divers  manners 
^^  spoke  in  times  past  to  the  fathers  by  the  prophets, 
last  of  all, 

In  these  days  hath  spoken  to  us  by  his  Son,  whom  he 
hath  appointed  heir  of  all  things,  by  whom  also  he  made 
the  world. 

Who  being  the  brightness  of  his  glory,  and  the  figure 
of  his  substance,  and  upholding  all  things  by  the  word 
of  his  power,  making  purgation  of  sins,  sitteth  on  the 
right  hand  of  the  majesty  on  high. 

Being  made  so  much  better  than  the  angels,  as  he  hath 
inherited  a  more  excellent  name  than  they. 

For  to  which  of  the  angels  hath  he  said  at  any  time: 
Thou  art  my  Son,  to-day  have  I  begotten  thee?  And 
again,  I  will  be  to  him  a  Father,  and  he  shall  be  to  me 
a  Son? 

And  again,  when  he  bringeth  in  the  first  begotten 
into  the  world,  he  saith :  And  let  all  the  angels  of  God 
adore  him. 

And  to  the  angels  indeed  he  saith  :  He  that  maketh  his 
angels  spirits,  and  his  ministers  a  flame  of  fire. 


December — Hours  of  the  Nativity  377 

But  to  the  Son:  Thy  throne,  O  God,  is  for  ever  and 
ever:  a  sceptre  of  justice  is  the  sceptre  of  thy  Kingdom. 

Thou  hast  loved  justice,  and  hated  iniquity:  therefore 
God,  thy  God,  hath  anointed  thee  with  the  oil  of  glad- 
ness above  thy  fellows. 

And:  Thou  in  the  beginning,  O  Lord,  didst  found 
the  earth :  and  the  works  of  thy  hands  are  the  heavens. 

They  shall  perish,  but  thou  shalt  continue:  and  they 
shall  all  grow  old  as  a  garment. 

And  as  a  vesture  shalt  thou  change  them,  and  they 
shall  be  changed:  but  thou  art  the  selfsame:  and  thy 
years  shall  not  fail. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (1:18  to  end) 

XTOW  the  generation  of  Christ  was  in  this  wise. 
^^  When  as  his  Mother  Mary  was  espoused  to  Jos- 
eph, before  they  came  together,  she  was  found  with 
child,  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Whereupon  Joseph  her  husband,  being  a  just  man, 
and  not  willing  publicly  to  expose  her,  was  minded  to 
put  her  away  privately. 

But  while  he  thought  on  these  things,  behold  the 
angel  of  the  Lord  appeared  to  him  in  his  sleep,  saying: 
Joseph,  son  of  David,  fear  not  to  take  unto  thee  Mary 
thy  wife,  for  that  which  is  conceived  in  her,  is  of  the 
Holy  Spirit. 

And  she  shall  bring  forth  a  son:  and  thou  shalt  call 
his  name  Jesus.  For  he  shall  save  his  people  from  their 
sins. 

Now  all  this  was  done  that  it  might  be  fulfilled  which 
the  Lord  spoke  by  the  prophet,  saying: 

Behold  a  virgin  shall  be  with  child,  and  bring  forth 
a  son,  and  they  shall  call  his  name  Emmanuel,  which 
being  interpreted  is,  God  with  us. 

And  Joseph  rising  up  from  sleep,  did  as  the  angel 
of  the  Lord  had  commanded  him,  and  took  unto  him 
his  wife.

And  Joseph  also  went  up  from  Galilee,  out  of  the 
city  of  Nazareth  into  Judea,  to  the  city  of  David,  which 
is  called  Bethlehem:  because  he  was  of  the  house  and 
family  of  David, 

To  be  enrolled  with  Mary  his  espoused  wife,  who  was 
great  with  child. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that  when  they  were  there,  her 
days  were  accomplished,  that  she  should  be  delivered. 

And  she  brought  forth  her  firstborn  son,  and  wrapped 
him  up  in  swaddling  clothes,  and  laid  him  in  a  manger; 
because  there  was  no  room  for  them  in  the  inn. 

And  there  were  in  the  same  country  shepherds  watch- 
ing, and  keeping  the  night  watches  over  their  flock. 

And  behold  an  angel  of  the  Lord  stood  by  them,  and 
the  brightness  of  God  shone  round  about  them;  and 
they  feared  with  a  great  fear. 

And  the  angel  said  to  them:  Fear  not;  for,  behold, 
I  bring  you  good  tidings  of  great  joy,  that  shall  be  to  all 
the  people: 

For  this  day,  is  born  to  you  a  Saviour,  who  is  Christ 
the  Lord,  in  the  city  of  David. 

And  this  shall  be  a  sign  unto  you.  You  shall  find  the 
infant  wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes,  and  laid  in  a 
manger. 

And  suddenly  there  was  with  the  angel  a  multitude 
of  the  heavenly  army,  praising  God,  and  saying: 

Glory  to  God  in  the  highest;  and  on  earth  peace  to 
men  of  good  will. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  after  the  angels  departed  from 
them  into  heaven,  the  shepherds  said  one  to  another: 
Let  us  go  over  to  Bethlehem,  and  let  us  see  this  word 
that  is  come  to  pass,  which  the  Lord  hath  showed  to  us. 

And  they  came  with  haste;  and  they  found  Mary  and 
Joseph,  and  the  infant  lying  in  the  manger. 

And  seeing,  they  understood  of  the  word  that  had 
been  spoken  to  them  concerning  this  child. 

And  all  that  heard,  wondered;  and  at  those  things 
that  were  told  them  by  the  shepherds.

And  he  shall  live  and  unto  him  shall  be  given  of  the 
gold  of  Arabia,  for  him  they  shall  always  adore:  they 
shall  bless  him  all  the  day. 

And  there  shall  be  a  firmament  on  the  earth  on  the 
tops  of  mountains,  above  Libanus  shall  the  fruit  thereof 
be  exalted :  and  they  of  the  city  shall  flourish  like  the 
grass  of  the  earth. 

Let  his  name  be  blessed  for  evermore:  his  name  con- 
tinueth  before  the  sun. 

And  in  him  shall  all  the  tribes  of  the  earth  be  blessed : 
all  nations  shall  magnify  him.  Blessed  be  the  Lord,  the 
God  of  Israel,  who  alone  doth  wonderful  things. 

And  blessed  be  the  name  of  his  majesty  for  ever:  and 
the  whole  earth  shall  be  filled  with  his  majesty.  So  be 
it.    So  be  it. 

The  praises  of  David,  the  son  of  Jesse,  are  ended. 

Psalm  131 

/^  LORD,  remember  David,  and  all  his  meekness. 
^^^  How  he  swore  to  the  Lord,  he  vowed  a  vow  to  the 
God  of  Jacob: 

If  I  shall  enter  into  the  tabernacle  of  my  house:  if  I 
shall  go  up  into  the  bed  wherein  I  lie. 


December — Hours  of  the  Nativity  385 

If  I  shall  give  sleep  to  my  eyes,  or  slumber  to  my 
eyelids. 

Or  rest  to  my  temples :  until  I  find  out  a  place  for  the 
Lord,  a  tabernacle  for  the  God  of  Jacob. 

Behold  we  have  heard  of  it  in  Ephrata:  we  have 
found  it  in  the  fields  of  the  wood. 

We  will  go  into  his  tabernacle:  we  will  adore  in  the 
place  where  his  feet  stood. 

Arise,  O  Lord,  into  thy  resting  place:  thou  and  the 
ark,  which  thou  hast  sanctified. 

Let  thy  priests  be  clothed  with  justice:  and  let  thy 
saints  rejoice. 

For  thy  servant  David's  sake,  turn  not  away  the  face 
of  thy  anointed. 

The  Lord  hath  sworn  truth  to  David,  and  he  will  not 
make  it  void:  of  the  fruit  of  thy  womb  I  will  set  upon 
thy  throne. 

If  thy  children  will  keep  my  covenant,  and  these  my 
testimonies  which  I  shall  teach  them. 

Their  children  also  for  evermore  shall  sit  upon  thy 
throne. 

For  the  Lord  hath  chosen  Sion :  he  hath  chosen  it  for 
his  dwelling. 

This  is  my  rest  for  ever  and  ever:  here  will  I  dwell, 
for  I  have  chosen  it. 

Blessing  I  will  bless  her  widow:  I  will  satisfy  her 
poor  with  bread. 

I  will  clothe  her  priests  with  salvation:  and  her  saints 
shall  rejoice  with  exceeding  great  joy. 

There  will  I  bring  forth  a  horn  to  David  :  I  have  pre- 
pared a  lamp  for  my  anointed. 

His  enemies  I  will  clothe  with  confusion:  but  upon 
him  shall  my  sanctification  flourish. 

Psalm  90 

T-JE  that  dwelleth  in  the  aid  of  the  most  High  shall 
abide  under  the  protection  of  the  God  of  Jacob. 
He  shall  say  to  the  Lord  :  Thou  art  my  protector,  and 
my  refuge:  my  God,  in  him  will  I  trust. 


386  Menaion 

For  he  hath  delivered  me  from  the  snare  of  the  hunt- 
ers: and  from  the  sharp  word. 

He  will  overshadow  thee  with  his  shoulders:  and 
under  his  wings  thou  shalt  trust. 

His  truth  shall  compass  thee  with  a  shield :  thou  shalt 
not  be  afraid  of  the  terror  of  the  night. 

Of  the  arrow  that  flieth  in  the  day,  of  the  business 
that  walketh  about  in  the  dark:  of  invasion,  or  of  the 
noonday  devil. 

A  thousand  shall  fall  at  thy  side,  and  ten  thousand  at 
thy  right  hand;  but  it  shall  not  come  night  thee. 

But  thou  shalt  consider  with  thy  eyes:  and  shalt  see 
the  reward  of  the  wicked. 

Because  thou,  O  Lord,  art  my  hope:  thou  hast  made 
the  most  High  thy  refuge. 

There  shall  no  evil  come  to  thee :  nor  shall  the  scourge 
come  near  thy  dwelling. 

For  he  hath  given  his  angels  charge  over  thee;  to 
keep  thee  in  all  thy  ways. 

In  their  hands  they  shall  bear  thee  up :  lest  thou  dash 
thy  foot  against  a  stone. 

Thou  shalt  walk  upon  the  asp  and  the  basilisk:  and 
thou  shalt  trample  under  foot  the  lion  and  the  dragon. 

Because  he  hoped  in  me  I  will  deliver  him  I  will 
protect  him  because  he  hath  known  my  name. 

He  shall  cry  to  me,  and  I  will  hear  him:  I  am  with 
him  in  tribulation,  I  will  deliver  him,  and  I  will  glorify 
him. 

I  will  fill  him  with  length  of  days;  and  I  will  shew 
him  my  salvation.

388  Menaion 

From  the  womb  before  the  morning  star  I  bore  thee. 
Said  the  Lord  to  my  Lord,  Sit  thou  on  my  right  hand. 

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  (7 :10-16; 
8:1-4,  9-10) 

A  ND  the  Lord  spoke  again  to  Achaz  saying: 

Ask  thee  a  sign  of  the  Lord  thy  God,  either  unto 
the  depth  of  hell,  or  unto  the  height  above. 

And  Achaz  said :  I  will  not  ask,  and  I  will  not  tempt 
the  Lord. 

And  he  said:  Hear  ye  therefore,  O  house  of  David: 
Is  it  a  small  thing  for  you  to  be  grievous  to  men,  that 
you  are  grievous  to  my  God  also? 

Therefore  the  Lord  himself  shall  give  you  a  sign. 
Behold  a  virgin  shall  conceive,  and  bear  a  son,  and  his 
name  shall  be  called  Emmanuel. 

He  shall  eat  butter  and  honey,  that  he  may  know  to 
refuse  the  evil,  and  to  choose  the  good. 

For  before  the  child  know  to  refuse  the  evil  and  to 
choose  the  good,  the  land  which  thou  abhorrest  shall 
be  forsaken  of  the  face  of  her  two  kings. 

And  the  Lord  said  to  me:  Take  thee  a  great  book, 
and  write  in  it  with  a  man's  pen.  Take  away  the  spoils 
with  speed,  quickly  take  the  prey. 

And  I  took  unto  me  faithful  witnesses,  Urias  the 
priest,  and  Zacharias  the  son  of  Barachias. 

And  I  went  to  the  Prophetess,  and  she  conceived,  and 
bore  a  son.  And  the  Lord  said  to  me:  Call  his  name. 
Hasten  to  take  away  the  spoils:  Make  haste  to  take 
away  the  prey. 

For  before  the  child  know  to  call  his  father  and  his 
mother,  the  strength  of  Damascus,  and  the  spoils  of 
Samaria  shall  be  taken  away  before  the  king  of  the 
Assyrians. 

Gather  yourselves  together,  O  ye  people,  and  be  over- 
come, and  give  ear,  all  ye  lands  afar  off:  strengthen 
yourselves,  and  be  overcome,  gird  yourselves,  and  be, 
overcome. 


December — Hours  of  the  Nativity  389 

Take  counsel  together,  and  it  shall  be  defeated :  speak 
a  word,  and  it  shall  not  be  done :  because  God  is  with  us. 

The  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews  (1:10  to  end, 

and  2:1-3) 

T^HOU  in  the  beginning,  O  Lord,  didst  found  the 
earth :  and  the  works  of  thy  hands  are  the  heavens. 

They  shall  perish,  but  thou  shalt  continue;  and  they 
all  shall  grow  old  as  a  garment. 

And  as  a  vesture  shalt  thou  change  them,  and  they 
shall  be  changed :  but  thou  art  the  self-same,  and  thy 
years  shall  not  fail. 

But  to  which  of  the  angels  said  he  at  any  time:  Sit 
on  my  right  hand,  until  I  make  thy  enemies  thy  foot- 
stool ? 

Are  they  not  all  ministering  spirits,  sent  to  minister 
for  them,  who  shall  receive  the  inheritance  of  salvation. 

Therefore,  ought  we  more  diligently  to  observe  the 
things  which  we  have  heard,  lest  perhaps  we  should  let 
them  slip. 

For  if  the  word  spoken  by  angels  become  steadfast, 
and  every  transgression  and  disobedience  received  a 
just  recompense  of  reward; 

How  shall  we  escape,  if  we  neglect  so  great  a  salva- 
tion? which  having  begun  to  be  declared  by  the  Lord, 
was  confirmed  unto  us  by  them  that  heard  him. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (2:1-12) 

^II7HEN  Jesus  therefore  was  born  in  Bethlehem  of 
^^  Judaea,  in  the  days  of  King  Herod,  behold,  there 
came  Wise  Men  from  the  east  to  Jerusalem. 

Saying:  Where  is  he  that  is  born  king  of  the  Jews? 
for  we  have  seen  his  star  in  the  East,  and  are  come  to 
adore  him. 

And  king  Herod  hearing  this,  was  troubled,  and  all 
Jerusalem  with  him. 


390  Menaion 

And  assembling  together  all  the  chief  priests  and 
the  scribes  of  the  people,  he  inquired  of  them  where 
Christ  should  be  born. 

But  they  said  to  him :  In  Bethlehem  of  Juda.  For  so 
it  is  written  by  the  prophet: 

And  thou  Bethlehem  in  the  land  of  Juda  art  not  the 
least  among  the  princes  of  Juda:  for  out  of  thee  shall 
come  forth  the  captain  that  shall  rule  my  peope  Israel. 

Then  Herod,  privately  calling  the  wise  men,  learned 
diligently  of  them  the  time  of  the  star  which  appeared 
to  them. 

And  sending  them  into  Bethlehem,  said :  Go  and  dili- 
gently inquire  after  the  child,  and  when  you  have  found 
him,  bring  me  word  again,  that  I  also  may  come  and 
adore  him. 

Who  having  heard  the  king,  went  their  way  and  be- 
hold the  star  which  they  had  seen  in  the  East,  went 
before  them,  until  it  came  and  stood  over  where  the 
child  was. 

And  seeing  the  star  they  rejoiced  with  exceeding 
great  joy. 

And  entering  into  the  house,  they  found  the  child 
with  Mary  his  Mother,  and  falling  down,  they  adored 
him:  and  opening  their  treasures,  they  offered  him 
gifts;  gold,  frankincense,  and  myrrh. 

And  having  received  an  answer  in  sleep  that  they 
should  not  return  to  Herod,  they  went  back  another 
way  into  their  country. 

^And  immediately  say: 

Swiftly  let  thy  compassion  apprehend  us,  O  Lord; 
for  we  are  greatly  impoverished.  Help  us,  O  God  our 
Saviour,  for  thy  Name's  glory.  Lord,  deliver  us  and 
forgive  us  our  sins  for  thy  Name's  sake.

/^  GOD,  Lord  of  powers,  and  Creator  of  all  crea- 
^-^  tures,  for  the  indescribable  compassion  of  thy  mer- 
cies thou  didst  send  thine  only  Son  Jesus  Christ  for  the 
salvation  of  our  race;  and  by  his  Cross  thou  didst  tear 
up  the  decree  of  our  sins;  and  through  him  didst  shame 
the  principals  and  kings  of  darkness.  Thou,  Master, 
Lover  of  mankind,  accept  from  us  sinners  these  peti- 
tions and  pleadings  of  thanksgiving,  and  deliver  us 
from  every  dark  and  annihilating  fall,  from  all  those 
who  seek  to  do  us  wrong,  and  from  enemies  visible  and 
invisible.  Nail  the  fear  of  thee  in  our  bodies,  and  turn 
not  our  hearts  to  evil  speech  or  thoughts.  Nay,  by  thy 
longing,  wound  our  souls  that,  beholding  thee  always, 
and  being  guided  by  the  light  coming  from  thee,  and 
observing  thee,  O  unapproachable  eternal  Light,  we 
may  address  to  thee  ceaselessly  our  thanksgiving  and 
confession,  O  Father  without  beginning,  with  thine  onl}

Psalm  109 

TPHE  Lord  said  to  my  Lord:  Sit  thou  at  my  right 
-^  hand. 

Until  I  make  thy  enemies  thy  footstool. 

The  Lord  will  send  forth  the  sceptre  of  thy  power 
out  of  Sion :  rule  thou  in  the  midst  of  thy  enemies. 

With  thee  is  the  principality  in  the  day  of  thy 
strength :  in  the  brightness  of  the  saints :  from  the  womb 
before  the  day  star  I  begot  thee. 

The  Lord  hath  sworn,  and  he  will  not  repent:  Thou 
art  a  priest  for  ever  according  to  the  order  of  Melchi- 
sedech. 

The  Lord  at  thy  right  hand  hath  broken  kings  in  the 
day  of  his  wrath. 


392  Menaion 

He  shall  judge  among  nations,  he  shall  fill  ruins:  he 
shall  crush  the  heads  in  the  land  of  many. 

He  shall  drink  of  the  torrent  in  the  way:  therefore, 
shall  he  lift  up  the  head. 

Psalm  110 

T  WILL  praise  thee,  O  Lord,  with  my  whole  heart, 
in  the  council  of  the  just,  and  in  the  congregation. 

Great  are  the  works  of  the  Lord :  sought  out  accord- 
ing to  all  his  wills. 

His  work  is  praise  and  magnificence:  and  his  justice 
continueth  for  ever  and  ever. 

He  hath  made  a  remembrance  of  his  wonderful 
works,  being  a  merciful  and  gracious  Lord:  he  hath 
given  food  to  them  that  fear  him. 

He  will  be  mindful  for  ever  of  his  covenant:  he  will 
show  forth  to  his  people  the  power  of  his  works. 

That  he  may  give  them  the  inheritance  of  the  Gen- 
tiles: the  works  of  his  hands  are  truth  and  judgment. 

All  his  commandments  are  faithful:  confirmed  for 
ever  and  ever,  made  in  truth  and  equity. 

He  hath  sent  redemption  to  his  people:  he  hath  com- 
manded his  covenant  for  ever. 

Holy  and  terrible  is  his  Name:  the  fear  of  the  Lord 
is  the  beginning  of  wisdom.

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  (9:6-7) 

T^OR  a  child  is  born  to  us,  and  a  son  is  given  to  us^ 
-*-  and  the  government  is  upon  his  shoulders :  and  his 
name  shall  be  called,  Wonderful,  Counsellor,  God  the 
Mighty,  the  Father  of  the  world  to  come,  the  Prince  of 
Peace. 

His  empire  shall  be  multiplied,  and  there  shall  be  no 
end  of  peace:  He  shall  sit  upon  the  throne  of  David, 
and  upon  his  kingdom;  to  establish  it  and  strengthen  it 
with  judgment  and  with  justice,  from  henceforth  and 
for  ever:  the  zeal  of  the  Lord  of  hosts  will  perform 
this. 

The  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews  (2:11  to  end) 

"Y^E  brethren:  For  both  he  that  sanctifieth,  and  they 
"-*•'  who  are  sanctified,  are  all  one,  for  which  cause  he 
is  not  ashamed  to  call  them  brethren,  saying: 

I  will  declare  thy  Name  to  my  brethren;  in  the  midst 
of  the  church  will  I  praise  thee. 

And  again:  I  will  put  my  trust  in  him.  And  again: 
Behold  I  and  my  children,  whom  God  hath  given  me. 

Therefore  because  the  children  are  partakers  of  flesh 
and  blood,  he  also  himself  in  like  manner  hath  been 
partaker  of  the  same :  that  through  death,  he  might  de- 
stroy him  who  had  the  empire  of  death,  that  is  to  say, 
the  devil : 

And  might  deliver  them,  who  through  the  fear  of 
death  were  all  their  lifetime  subject  to  servitude. 

For  nowhere  doth  he  take  hold  of  the  angels:  but  of 
the  seed  of  Abraham  he  taketh  hold. 

Wherefore  it  behoved  him  in  all  things  to  be  made 
like  unto  his  brethren,  that  he  might  become  a  merciful 
and  faithful  high  priest  before  God,  that  he  might  be 
a  propitiation  for  the  sins  of  the  people. 

For  in  that,  wherein  he  himself  hath  suffered  and 
been  tempted,  he  is  able  to  succour  them  also  that  are 
tempted.

wall  of  partition,  and  the  flaming  spear  shall  turn  about,

for  me,  I  shall  return  to  enjoy  the  bliss  of  paradise  from 
which  I  was  driven  away  before,  by  reason  of  iniquity; 
for  the  likeness  of  the  Father,  and  the  Person  of  his

likeness  of  a  servant,  coming  from  a  Mother  who  has 
not  known  wedlock;  free  from  transubstantiation,  since 
he  remained  as  he  was,  true  God,  and  took  what  had  not 
been,  having  become  Man  for  his  love  of  mankind.

Thy  kingdom,  O  Christ  God,  is  a  kingdom  of  all 
ages;  and  thy  rule  is  from  generation  to  generation; 
for  thou  who  wast  incarnate  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and 
became  Man  from  Mary  the  ever-virgin,  hast  caused 
a  light  to  shine  on  us  by  thy  presence,  O  Christ  God; 
O  Light  of  Light,  O  Radiance  of  the  Father,  thou  hast 
illuminated  all  creation;  and  every  breath  doth  praise 
thee,  O  Likeness  of  the  glory  of  the  Father.  Where-

didst  shine  forth  from  the  Virgin,  O  God,  have  mercy 
upon  us. 

What  shall  we  render  to  thee,  O  Christ,  for  that  thou 
didst  appear  on  earth  as  a  man  for  our  sake?  Verily, 
every  individual  of  the  creatures  thou  didst  create  shall 
offer  thee  thanksgiving.  The  angels  shall  tender  thee

believed  in  one  divine  supremacy.  The  nations  were

^Then   the   Eisodos  with   the    Gospel;  and   O    resplendent   Light, 
^tc.  {p.  74) ;  and  the  following  readings. 


398  Menaion 

First  Reading:  from  Genesis  (1 :1-13) 

TN  the  beginning  God  created  heaven,  and  earth. 

And  the  earth  was  void  and  empty,  and  darkness 
was  upon  the  face  of  the  deep;  and  the  Spirit  of  God 
moved  over  the  waters. 

And  God  said :  Be  light  made.  And  light  was  made. 
And  God  saw  the  light  that  it  was  good ;  and  he  divided 
the  light  from  the  darkness. 

And  he  called  the  light  Day,  and  the  darkness  Night; 
and  there  was  evening  and  morning  one  day. 

And  God  said  :  Let  there  be  a  firmament  made  amidst 
the  waters;  and  let  it  divide  the  waters  from  the  waters. 

And  God  made  a  firmament,  and  divided  the  waters 
that  were  under  the  firmament,  from  those  that  were 
above  the  firmament,  and  it  was  so. 

And  God  called  the  firmament.  Heaven;  and  the  eve- 
ning and  morning  were  the  second  day. 

God  also  said:  Let  the  waters  that  are  under  the 
heaven,  be  gathered  together  into  one  place:  and  let 
the  dry  land  appear.    And  it  was  so  done. 

And  God  called  the  dry  land,  Earth;  and  the  gath- 
ering together  of  the  waters,  he  called  Seas.  And  God 
saw  that  it  was  good. 

And  he  said  :  Let  the  earth  bring  forth  the  green  herb, 
and  such  as  may  seed,  and  the  fruit  tree  yielding  after 
its  kind,  which  may  have  seed  in  itself  upon  the  earth. 
And  it  was  so  done. 

And  the  earth  brought  forth  the  green  herb,  and 
such  as  yieldeth  seed  according  to  its  kind,  and  the  tree 
that  beareth  fruit,  having  seed  each  one  according  to  its 
kind.    And  God  saw  that  it  was  good. 

And  the  evening  and  the  morning  were  the  third  day. 

ilThen  the  Right  Choir  singeth  the  following  Troparion,  in  the  Sixth 
Tone. 

DISGUISED,  O  Saviour,  thou  wast  born  in  a  cave; 
but  heaven  proclaimed  thee  to  all,  taking  for  its 
mouth  a  star.    And  it  offered  thee  the  Magi  worship- 


December — Christmas  Eve  399 

ping  thee  in  faith.  Wherefore,  with  them,  have  mercy 
upon  us. 

^The  last  section  of  this  Troparion,  beginning,  And  it  offered  thee 
the  Magi,  etc.  is  repeated  five  times  with  the  following  Stichoi  (Psalm 
86). 

1.  Whose  foundation  is  in  the  holy  mountains.  The 
Lord  loveth  the  gates  of  Zion  more  than  all  the  dwel- 
lings of  Jacob. 

2.  Glorious  things  are  said  of  thee,  O  City  of  God. 
I  will  be  mindful  of  Rahab  and  Babylon  knowing  me. 

3.  Behold  strange  nations,  and  Tyre  and  Ethiopia. 

4.  Those  were  born  there.  And  of  the  mother  Zion 
it  shall  be  said,  this  man  and  that  man  is  born  in  her, 
and  the  highest  himself  hath  founded  her. 

5.  The  Lord  shall  tell  in  his  writing  of  peoples  and 
of  princes  of  them  that  have  been  in  her,  the  dwelling 
in  thee  is  as  it  were  of  all  rejoicing. 

^Then  Glory  and  Now,  repeating  the  whole  Troparion;  and  im- 
mediately: 

Second  Reading:  from  Isaiah  the  Prophet 
For  a  child  is  born  to  us,  etc.  (p.  394). 

C^Then  the  Left  Choir  chanteth  the  following  Troparion,  in  the 
Sixth  Tone. 

nPHOU  hast  shone  forth  from  the  Virgin,  O  Christ, 
supersensual  Sun  of  justice.  And  a  star  pointed  to 
thee,  thou  uncontainable  One,  who  wast  contained  in  a 
cave.  And  the  Magi  were  led  to  thy  worship.  Where- 
fore, with  them,  we  magnify  thee,  O  thou  Giver  of  life. 
Glory  to  thee. 

C^The  last  paragraph,  And  the  Magi  were  led,  etc.,  is  repeated  five 
times  with  the  following  Stichoi  (Psalm  92). 

1.  The  Lord  hath  reigned,  he  is  clothed  with  beauty. 
The  Lord  is  clothed  with  strength,  and  hath  girded 
himself. 

2.  For  he  hath  established  the  world,  which  shall 
not  be  moved.    Thy  throne  is  prepared  from  of  old. 


400  Menaion 

3.  The  floods  have  lifted  up,  O  Lord;  the  floods 
have  lifted  up  their  voice.  The  floods  have  lifted  up 
their  waves,  with  the  noise  of  many  waters. 

4.  Wonderful  are  the  surges  of  the  sea.  Wonderful 
is  the  Lord  on  high.  Thy  testimonies  are  become  ex- 
ceedingly credible. 

5.  Holiness  becometh  thine  house,  O  Lord,  unto 
length  of  days.

C^And  in  the  Aposticha,  the  following  Idiomelons,  in  the  Second  Tone, 

By  Germanus 

T^ODAY  hath  come  about  a  great  and  w^onderful 
thing,  in  that  a  Virgin  giveth  birth,  yet  corruption 
hath  not  entered  the  womb;  the  Word  is  incarnate,  yet 
is  not  separated  from  the  Father;  the  angels  give  glory 
with  the  shepherds,  and  we  lift  our  voices  with  them 
crying,  Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace. 

Stichos:  Said  the  Lord  to  my  Lord;  Sit  thou  at  my 
right  hand.   (In  the  Third  Tone.) 

Today  the  Virgin  doth  give  birth  to  the  Creator  of 
all;  Eden  offereth  the  cave;  the  star  telleth  to  those  in 
darkness  of  Christ  the  Sun;  the  Magi  with  presents 
worshipped  him,  enlightened  by  faith;  and  the  shep- 
herds beheld  the  wonder,  the  angels  singing  and  saying, 
Glory  to  God  in  the  Highest. 

Stichos:  From  the  womb,  before  the  morning  star, 
I  begot  thee. 

Y\/^HEN  the  Lord  Jesus  was  born  in  Bethlehem  of 
Judaea,  the  Magi  came  from  the  east  and  wor- 
shipped him  as  incarnate  God.  Eagerly  they  opened 
their  treasures  and  offered  him  precious  gifts  —  pure 
gold  for  that  he  is  King  of  the  ages;  frankincense  in 
that  he  is  God  of  all;  and  as  dead  for  three  days  they 
offered  myrrh  to  the  deathless  One.  Wherefore,  come, 
all  ye  nations,  let  us  worship  him  who  was  born  to  save 
our  souls,

Glory,  in  the  Fourth  Tone  (By  John  of  Damascus) 

Ty  EJOICE,  O  Jerusalem,  and  celebrate  all  ye  lovers 
^^  of  Zion;  for  the  temporal  bonds  with  which  Adam 
was  condemned  have  been  loosened;  paradise  hath  been 
opened  for  us,  and  the  serpent  hath  been  annihilated, 
having  beheld  now  that  the  one  deceived  by  her  of  old 
hath  become  a  Mother  to  the  Creator.  Wherefore,  O 
both  the  depth,  the  richness,  the  wisdom,  and  the  knowl- 
edge of  God,  that  the  instrument  of  death  which 
brought  death  to  all  flesh,  hath  become  the  first-fruit 
of  salvation  to  all  the  world,  because  of  the  Theotokos; 
for  the  all-perfect  God  hath  been  born  therefrom  as  a 
babe;  and  by  his  Birth  he  hath  sealed  her  virginity;  by 
his  swaddling  clothes  he  hath  loosened  the  chains  of 
our  sins;  and  by  his  babyhood  he  hath  healed  the  pains 
and  sorrows  of  Eve.  Let  all  creation,  therefore,  ex- 
change glad  tidings  and  rejoice;  for  Christ  hath  come 
to  recall  it  and  to  save  our  souls. 

Now,  in  the  Same  Tone  (By  Anatolius) 

r\  CHRIST  God,  thou  hast  dwelt  in  a  cave,  and  a 
^^^  manger  did  receive  thee.  The  Magi  with  shep- 
herds worshipped  thee,  thus  fulfilling  the  preaching  of 
the  Prophets;  and  the  angelic  powers  wondered,  lifting 
their  voices  and  saying.  Glory  to  thy  condescension,  O 
thou  only  Lover  of  mankind. 

Troparion,  in  the  Fourth  Tone  (three  times) 

npHY  Nativity,  O  Christ  our  God,  hath  given  rise 
to  the  light  of  knowledge  in  the  world;  for  they 
that  worshipped  the  stars  did  learn  therefrom  to  wor- 
ship thee,  O  Sun  of  justice,  and  to  know  that  from  the 
east  of  the  Highest  thou  didst  come  O  Lord,  glory  to 
thee.

December  25 — Christmas  Matins  403 

/^^OM  E,  ye  believers,  let  us  see  where  Christ  was  born. 
^^  Let  us  follow  the  star  whither  it  goeth  with  the 
Magi,  kings  of  the  east;  for  there  angels  praise  him 
ceaselessly,  and  shepherds  raise  their  voices  in  a  worthy 
song  of  praise,  saying.  Glory  in  the  highest  to  the  One 
born  today  in  a  cave  from  the  virgin  Theotokos  in 
Bethlehem  of  Judaea. 

Why  wonderest  thou,  O  Mary;  and  why  art  thou  air- 
tonished  in  thy  inner  self?  And  she  respondeth,  say- 
ing. Because  I  have  given  birth  in  time  to  a  Son  un- 
bound by  time;  nor  do  I  comprehend  the  manner  of 
conception  of  him  that  is  born.  I  have  known  no  man; 
how  then  give  I  birth  to  a  son?  For  who  hath  yet  seen 
a  birth  without  seed?  But  since  God  willeth,  the  order 
of  nature  is  overcome,  as  it  hath  been  written,  Christ 
hath  been  born  of  the  Virgin  in  Bethlehem  of  Judaea. 

He  that  all  containeth  not,  how  was  he  contained  in 
the  womb?  And  he  that  is  in  the  bosom  of  the  Father, 
how  shall  he  be  carried  in  the  arms  of  his  Mother? 
Verily,  all  this  hath  been  fulfilled  as  he  himself  knew 
and  willed  and  was  pleased  to  do;  for  he  that  is  not 
carnal  hath  become  incarnate  by  his  own  choice;  and 
he  that  is,  hath  turned  for  our  sakes  to  that  which  he 
was  not,  sharing  our  creation,  yet  inseparable  from  his 
essence.  Verily,  Christ  hath  been  born  with  two  Na- 
tures, desiring  to  perfect  the  heavenly  world. 

Prokeimenon,  in  the  Fourth  Tone

born  now  of  a  Virgin  by  his  own  choice,  he  hath  trodden

thee  to  overcome  sin,  and  confirm  us  on  the  unshakeable 
foundation  of  faith. 

Left  Choir  4.  O  praised  Christ,  a  stem  hath  come 
out  of  Jesse,  and  from  it  hast  sprouted  a  Flower  from 
a  dense  and  shadowed  mountain,  O  immaterial  God, 
coming  incarnate  from  the  Virgin  that  hath  not  known 
man.    Glory,  therefore^  to  thy  might,  O  Lord. 

Right  Choir  (Another).  The  Prophet  Habakuk  of 
old  foretold  in  song  the  re-creation  of  mankind;  for  he 
was  worthy  to  behold  that  sign  in  an  ineffable  manner; 
for  the  Word  did  come  forth  as  a  new  babe  from  the 
mountain  of  the  Virgin,  for  the  re-creation  of  the 
nations. 

Right  Choir  5.  Since  thou  art  the  God  of  peace  and 
the  Father  of  mercies,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  thou  didst 
send  to  us  the  great  Messenger  of  thy  mind,  granting 
us  thy  peace.  Therefore,  have  we  been  led  aright  to 
the  light  of  divine  knowledge,  glorifying  thee  as  we 
come  out  of  darkness. 

Left  Choir  (Another).  Grant  forgiveness,  O  Christ, 
to  us  who  have  been  in  the  darkness  of  our  deeds  of 
error  since  the  night,  who  eagerly  praise  thee,  since 
thou  art  our  Benefactor;  that  thou  mayest  hasten  to  us 
and  prepare  for  us  a  good  way,  wherein  if  we  walk  we 
shall  find  glory  and  honour. 

Right  Choir  6.  The  sea-monster  did  disgorge  Jonah 
from  its  belly,  as  it  received  him  safely  like  a  foetus. 
As  for  the  Word,  when  he  dwelt  in  the  Virgin,  taking 
from  her  a  body,  he  was  born,  preserving  her  without 
corruption,  and  without  transubstantiation,  preserving 
his  Mother  without  harm. 

Left  Choir  (Another).  Verily,  Jonah  when  he  was 
in  the  depth  of  the  sea,  begged  to  ascend  to  thee  and  to 
be  rescued  from  the  tempest.  But  as  for  me,  having 
been  pierced  by  the  arrows  of  the  tyrant,  in  thee  I  seek 
refuge,  O  evil-destroying  Christ.  Hasten  thou  to  me 
and  deliver  me  hastily  from  my  negligence. 


406  Menaion 

Right  Choir  7.  The  youths  having  grown  together 
in  true  worship,  despising  the  command  of  the  infidel, 
were  not  dismayed  by  the  threat  of  fire;  but  were  sing- 
ing as  they  stood  in  the  midst  of  the  flames,  Blessed  art 
thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

Left  Choir  (Another).  The  youths  having  clung 
steadfastly  to  the  love  of  the  King  of  all,  ridiculed  the 
prating  and  blasphemy  of  the  blaspheming  usurper. 
And  being  filled  with  wrath,  he  delivered  them  to  the 
terrible  fire  which  did  not  harm  them.  Wherefore, 
they  lifted  their  voices  to  the  Master,  saying.  Blessed 
art  thou  unto  all  ages. 

Let  us  praise,  bless,  and  worship  the  Lord. 

Left  Choir  8.  Verily,  the  dewy  furnace  did  shadow^ 
the  sign  of  the  supernatural  wonder;  for  it  burned  not 
the  youths  whom  it  received,  as  the  fire  of  divinity  also 
burned  not  the  womb  of  the  Virgin  in  which  it  dwelt. 
Wherefore,  let  us  ofifer  praise  with  song,  saying,  Let  all 
creation  praise  the  Lord,  exalting  him  evermore,  to  the 
end  of  ages. 

Right  Choir  (Another).  The  youths  who  were  cast 
of  old  into  the  fire  and  remained  unburned,  were  a  sign 
of  the  womb  of  the  Maiden  who  gave  birth  supernat- 
urally  while  yet  sealed.  These  two  matters  grace  hath 
accomplished  through  one  miracle,  arousing  the  na- 
tions to  praise. 

^And  immediately ,  instead  of  O  thou  who  art  more  honourable, 
etc.,  the  Ninth  Ode  of  the  two  Canons  is  chanted  with  its  Magnifica- 
tions. 

Ninth  Ode  of  the  First  Canon 

A/f  AGNIFY,  O  my  soul,  her  who  is  more  honourable 
^and  more  exalted  in  glory  than  the  heavenly  hosts. 
9.  I  behold  a  strange  and  wonderful  mystery:  the 
cave  a  heaven,  the  Virgin  a  cherubic  throne,  and  the 
manger  a  noble  place  in  which  hath  lain  Christ  the  un- 
contained  God.  Let  us,  therefore,  praise  and  magnify 
him. 


December  25 — Christmas  Matins  407 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  God  born  in  flesh  from  the 
Virgin. 

When  the  Magi  saw  a  new  and  strange  star  appear- 
ing suddenly,  moving  in  a  wonderful  way,  and  trans- 
cending the  stars  of  heaven  in  brightness,  they  were 
guided  by  it  to  Christ,  the  King  born  on  earth  in  Beth- 
lehem, for  our  salvation. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  King  born  in  a  cave. 

The  Magi  said.  Where  is  the  child  King,  the  new 
born,  whose  star  hath  appeared?  For  we  have  verily 
come  to  worship  him.  And  Herod,  the  contender 
against  God,  trembled,  and  began  to  roar  in  folly  to 
kill  Christ. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  God  worshipped  by  the 
Magi. 

Herod  ascertaiaed  from  the  Magi  about  the  time  of 
the  star  by  whose  guidance  they  were  led  to  Bethlehem 
to  worship  with  presents  Christ  who  guided  them,  and 
so  they  returned  to  their  country,  disregarding  Herod, 
the  evil  murderer  of  babes,  mocking  him. 

The  Ninth  Ode  of  the  Other  Canon 

^  I  ^ODAY  the  Virgin  giveth  birth  to  the  Lord  inside 
the  cave. 

Verily,  it  is  easier  for  us  to  endure  silence  since  there 
is  no  dread  danger  therefrom  for  us.  But  because  of 
our  strong  desire,  O  Virgin,  and  Mother  of  sameness,  to 
indite  well-balanced  songs  of  praise,  this  becometh  in- 
deed onerous  to  us.  Wherefore,  grant  us  power  to 
equal  our  natural  inclination. 

Glory:  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  might  of  the  indi- 
visible and  three-personed  Godhead. 

O  pure  one,  Mother  of  the  Word  that  appeareth 
newly  from  thee,  O  closed  door,  verily,  as  we  behold 
the  dark  shadowy  symbols  pass  away,  we  glorify  the 
light  of  the  truth  and  bless  thy  womb  as  is  meet. 

Now:  Glorify,  O  my  soul,  her  who  hath  delivered 
us  from  the  curse. 


408  Menaion 

The  Christ-pleasing  people,  O  Virgin,  having  de- 
served to  be  granted  its  desire  by  the  coming  of  God, 
doth  seek  now  with  tears  thy  help  to  worship  the  glory 
of  his  enlivening  appearance  wherein  is  the  renewal  of 
birth;  for  it  is  thou  who  dost  distribute  grace,  O  pure 
one.

I  behold  a  strange  and  wonderful  mystery,  etc.  {p.  406) ;  and  Verily,

nification, Magi  with  shepherds  did  come  to  worship  Christ  born  in 
the  city  of  Bethlehem. 

Exaposteilarion  (three  times) 

/^UR  Saviour  hath  visited  us  from  on  high,  from  the 
east  of  easts.    Wherefore,  we  who  are  in  darkness 
and  shadows  have  found  the  truth;  for  the  Lord  hath 
been  born  of  the  Virgin. 

^Then  in  the  Einos,  the  following  four  Idiomelons  are  sung,  in  the 
Fourth  Tone. 

By  Andrew  the  Jerusalemite 

T)  EJOICE,  O  righteous  ones,  and  ye  heavens  be  glad. 
•^^  Sing  with  joy,  ye  mountains,  for  the  Nativity  of 
Christ.  The  Virgin  sitteth  like  the  cherubim,  holding 
in  her  bosom  God  the  incarnate  Word;  the  shepherds 
do  glorify  him  who  was  born.  The  Magi  ofifer  presents 
to  the  Lord,  and  the  angels  give  praise,  saying,  O  Lord, 
hidden  from  comprehension,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Father  hath  been  pleased  and  satisfied ;  the  Word 
hath  become  flesh;  and  the  Virgin  hath  given  birth  to 
incarnate  God.  The  star  declaimeth,  the  Magi  wor- 
ship, the  shepherds  wonder,  and  creation  rejoiceth. 

O  virgin  Theotokos,  O  thou  who  hast  given  birth  to 
the  Saviour,  thou  hast  revoked  the  ancient  curse  of  Eve; 
for  thou  hast  become  a  Mother  according  to  the  pleas- 
ure of  God,  carrying  in  thy  bosom  God  the  incarnate 
Word.  Verily,  the  mystery  is  inscrutable;  but  we  all 
glorify  it  with  faith  only,  crying  with  thee  and  saying, 
O  incomprehensible  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 


December  25 — Christmas  409 

Come,  let  us  praise  the  Mother  of  the  Saviour,  who 
appeared  a  Virgin  even  after  birth-giving,  crying.  Re- 
joice, O  living  city  of  God  the  King,  in  whom  Christ 
having  dwelt  worked  salvation.  Wherefore,  we  with 
Gabriel  do  praise,  and  with  the  shepherds  do  glorify 
thee,  crying,  O  Theotokos,  intercede  with  him  incar- 
nate of  thee  to  save  us.

TIT^HEN  it  was  time  for  thy  presence  on  earth  the 
^  ^  the  first  enrollment  of  the  world  took  place.  Then 
it  was  that  thou  didst  decide  to  enroll  the  names  of  men 
who  believe  in  thy  Nativity.  Yea,  that  commandment 
did  issue  forth  from  Caesar,  since  the  everlastingness 
of  thine  eternal  kingdom  hath  been  renewed.  Where- 
fore, we  offer  what  is  better  than  moneyed  tax,  namely 
Orthodox  theological  sayings;  to  thee,  O  God,  Saviour

Today  the  Beginningless  doth  begin,  and  the  Word

the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good-will  towards  men.

Selection  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Galatians 

(4:4-7) 

E  brethren:  But  when  the  fullness  of  the  time  was 
come,  God  sent  his  Son,  made  of  a  woman,  made 
under  the  law. 

That  he  might  redeem  them  who  were  under  the  law : 
that  we  might  receive  the  adoption  of  sons. 

And  because  you  are  sons,  God  hath  sent  the  Spirit 
of  his  Son  into  your  hearts,  crying:  Abba,  Father. 

Therefore,  now  he  is  not  a  servant,  but  a  son.  And 
if  a  son,  an  heir  also  through  God.

Tone. 

By  John  of  Damascus 

T^ODAY  hath  been  fulfilled  a  strange  mystery;  for 
nature  hath  been  renewed  and  God  hath  become 
man.  Yea,  he  hath  remained  as  he  has  been,  taking 
unto  himself  what  had  not  been,  nor  was  he  affected  by 
any  confusion  or  division. 

Stichos:    Said  the  Lord  to  my  Lord. 

O  Lord,  thou  hast  come  to  Bethlehem,  thou  hast 
dwelt  in  a  cave,  and  hast  lain  down  in  a  manger,  O 
thou  whose  throne  is  in  heaven.  Thou  didst  condescend 
to  the  shepherds,  O  thou  who  art  surrounded  by  the 


412  Menaion 

hosts  of  angels,  in  order  to  save  our  race,  since  thou  art 
compassionate.    Glory  to  thee. 

Stichos:  From  the  womb  before  the  morning  star,  I 
begat  thee,  etc. 

How  shall  I  describe  this  great  mystery?  For  the 
Incorporeal  hath  become  incarnate ;  the  Word  took  unto 
himself  the  density  of  the  flesh.  The  Unseen  is  seen,  the 
Untouchable  is  touched,  the  Beginningless  beginneth, 
and  the  Son  of  God  becometh  the  Son  of  Man;  yea, 
Jesus  Christ  himself  who  is  the  same  yesterday,  today,

namely  the  Virgin,  and  from  that  did  shine  forth  Christ 
the  Flower,  renewing  the  creation  of  Adam  and  Eve 
from  corruption;  for  he  is  compassionate. 

Verily,  Joseph  the  betrothed,  saw  clearly  in  his  old 
age  that  the  foresayings  of  the  Prophets  had  been  ful- 
filled openly;  for  he  was  given  a  strange  earnest,  receiv- 
ing inspiration  from  the  angels,  who  cried.  Glory  to 
God;  for  he  hath  bestowed  peace  on  earth. 

Let  us  extol  the  brother  of  the  Lord;  for  he  is  a 
Bishop,  and  he  also  radiated  forth  bravely  in  martyr- 
dom. Wherefore,  O  Jesus  our  God,  who  was  wrapped 
in  swaddling  clothes  in  the  cave  and  manger,  save 
through  his  petitions,  all  those  who  praise  thee.

swaddling  clothes,  and  he  who  was  eight  days  old  on 
the  side  of  his  Mother,  and  eternal  on  the  side  of  his 
Father  did  not  disdain  the  circumcision  of  the  flesh. 
Wherefore,  let  us  cry  unto  him,  O  believers,  Thou  art 
our  God;  have  mercy  upon  us.     (Repeat.) 


January  1 — The  Circumcision  417 

The  all-good  God  did  not  disdain  to  be  circumcised 
by  the  circumcision  of  the  flesh;  but  offered  himself  a 
Sign  and  an  Exemplar  of  salvation  to  all,  for  the 
Maker  of  the  law  doth  fulfill  the  precepts  of  the  law^ 
and  the  preaching  of  the  Prophets  concerning  him. 
Wherefore,  O  thou  who  dost  contain  all  in  thy  grasp, 
O  thou  who  wast  wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes,  O 
Lord,  glory  to  thee 


And  to  the  Saint,  three  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

r\  THOU,  whose  name  correspondeth  to  the  name  of 
the  kingdom,  when  thou  didst  lead  in  thy  kingly 
rank  the  holy  people  of  Christ  in  wisdom  and  knowl- 
edge, O  Father,  then  the  King  of  kings  and  Lord  of  all, 
the  Son  united  everlastingly  with  the  Father,  and  co- 
eternal  with  him,  did  adorn  thee  with  the  crown  of  the 
kingdom.  Wherefore,  plead  with  him  to  save  and 
illuminate  our  souls. 

O  thou  who  art  adorned  with  the  vestments  of  a 
Bishop,  thou  didst  preach,  O  Basil,  the  Gospel  of  the 
kingdom  gladly,  and  didst  pour  out  for  the  Church 
the  teachings  of  Orthodoxy,  wherewith  being  lighted, 
we  speak  divinely  and  glorify  the  one  Godhead,  al- 
mighty Father,  only  Word  of  God,  and  divine  Spirit, 
in  three  Persons,  indivisible.  Wherefore,  implore  him 
to  save  and  enlighten  our  souls. 

O  thou  who  art  in  the  ranks  of  the  heavenly  orders, 
O  thou  Father  Basil  who  dwellest  among  them,  emu- 
lating their  way  with  the  humility  of  thine  all-resplen- 
dent way,  verily,  when  thou  wast  in  the  flesh,  thou  didst 
dwell  among  men  as  one  without  the  flesh.  Wherefore, 
plead  thou  with  Christ  our  God  in  behalf  of  us,  who 
delight  in  thy  God-inspired  teachings,  to  save  us  from 
dangers  and  from  the  darkness  of  folly,  and  to  lighten 
our  souls.

r\  RIGHTEOUS  one,  thou  didst  become  a  lover  of 
^-^  wisdom,  preferring  the  life  with  God  to  all  pos- 
sessions; and  by  thy  contemplation  of  death  thou  didst 
forsake  wealth,  as  is  meet;  for  by  the  hardships  of 
abstinence  thou  didst  strip  from  thyself  the  passion  of 
the  flesh;  by  thy  study  of  divine  law  thou  didst  preserve 
the  rank  of  thy  soul  unsubjugated;  and  by  richness  of 
virtue  thou  didst  wholly  subject  the  passion  of  the  flesh 
to  the  spirit.  Wherefore,  having  disposed  the  flesh,  the 
world,  and  the  chief  of  the  world,  standing  before 
Christ,  seek  thou  for  our  souls  the  Great  Mercy.

menon;  and  the  following  Readings. 

First  Reading :  from  Genesis  (17 :l-7 ;  9-14) 

A  ND  the  Lord  appeared  to  Abram  and  said  unto 
^  him  :  I  am  the  Almighty  God  :  walk  before  me  and 
be  perfect. 

And  I  will  make  my  covenant  between  me  and  thee : 
and  I  will  multiply  thee  exceedingly. 

Abram  fell  flat  on  his  face. 

And  God  said  to  him :  I  am,  and  my  covenant  is  with 
thee,  and  thou  shalt  be  a  father  of  many  nations. 

Neither  shall  thy  name  be  called  any  more  Abram: 
but  thou  shalt  be  called  Abraham :  because  I  have  made 
thee  a  father  of  many  nations. 

And  I  will  make  thee  increase,  exceedingly,  and  I 
will  make  nations  of  thee,  and  kings  shall  come  out  of 
thee. 

And  I  will  establish  mv  covenant  between  me  and 
thee,  and  between  thy  seed  after  thee  in  their  genera- 
tions, bv  a  perpetual  covenant:  to  be  a  God  to  thee, 
and  to  thy  seed  after  thee. 


January   1 — The  Circumcision  419 

Again  God  said  to  Abraham:  And  thou  therefore 
shalt  keep  my  covenant,  and  thy  seed  after  thee  in  their 
generations. 

This  is  my  covenant  which  you  shall  observe,  between 
me  and  you,  and  thy  seed  after  thee:  All  the  male  kind 
of  you  shall  be  circumcised: 

And  you  shall  circumcise  the  flesh  of  your  foreskin, 
that  it  may  be  for  a  sign  of  the  covenant  between  me 
and  you. 

An  infant  of  eight  days  old  shall  be  circumcised 
among  you,  every  man  child  in  your  generations:  he 
that  is  born  in  the  house,  as  well  as  the  bought  servant 
shall  be  circumcised,  and  whosoever  is  not  of  your 
stock : 

And  my  covenant  shall  be  in  your  flesh  for  a  per- 
petual covenant. 

The  male,  whose  flesh  of  his  foreskin  shall  not  be 
circumcised,  that  soul  shall  be  destroyed  out  of  his 
people:  because  he  hath  broken  my  covenant. 

Second  Reading:  from  the  Book  of  Proverbs  (8:22-30) 

npHE   Lord   possessed  me  in  the  beginning  of  his 

ways,  before  he  made  any  thing  from  the  beginning. 

I  was  set  up  from  eternity,  and  of  old  before  the 
earth  was  made. 

The  depths  were  not  as  yet,  and  I  was  already  con- 
ceived, neither  had  the  fountains  of  waters  as  yet  sprung 
out: 

The  mountains  with  their  huge  bulk  had  not  as  yet 
been  established:  before  the  hills  I  was  brought  forth: 

He  had  not  yet  made  the  earth,  nor  the  rivers,  nor 
the  poles  of  the  world. 

When  he  prepared  the  heavens,  I  was  present:  when 
with  a  certain  law  and  compass  he  enclosed  the  depths: 

When  he  established  the  sky  above,  and  poised  the 
fountains  of  waters. 

When  he  compassed  the  sea  with  its  bounds,  and  set 
a  law  to  the  waters  that  they  should  not  pass  their  limits : 
when  he  balanced  the  foundations  of  the  earth;

I  was  with  him  forming  all  things :  and  was  delighted 
every  day,  playing  before  him  at  all  times. 

Third  Reading:  from  the  Book  of  Wisdom 

^  I  ^HE  mouth  of  the  righteous  uttereth  wisdom,  and 
the  lips  of  the  wise  direct  blessings.  The  mouth 
of  the  wise  contemplates  wisdom,  and  the  just  shall 
deliver  them  from  death.  When  the  righteous  man 
dieth,  his  hope  shall  not  perish,  for  the  righteous  son 
is  born  unto  life,  and  from  his  righteous  deeds  are 
reaped  the  fruits  of  justice.  A  light  unto  the  righteous, 
shining  for  all  time;  and  from  the  Lord  they  shall  find 
grace  and  glory.  The  tongues  of  the  wise  excel  in  in- 
struction, and  in  their  hearts  wisdom  finds  rest.  The 
Lord  loveth  the  righteous  hearts,  and  they  who  are 
blameless  in  their  ways  are  acceptable  to  him.  The 
wisdom  of  the  Lord  lighteth  the  countenance  of  the 
understanding  one;  and  they  who  desire  it  shall  be 
apprehended  by  it  before  it  is  known.  It  is  beholden 
without  difficulty  by  those  who  love  it,  and  he  who 
riseth  up  early  for  it  shall  not  tire.  He  who  watcheth 
for  it  by  night,  soon  will  be  without  worry,  for  it  goeth 
after  those  who  seek  it  and  seeketh  them.  In  the  high- 
ways it  appeareth  for  them  pleasantly.  But  no  evil 
can  overcome  wisdom.  Her  have  I  loved,  and  have 
sought  her  out  from  my  youth,  and  have  desired  to 
take  her  for  my  spouse,  and  I  became  a  lover  of  her 
beauty. 

She  glorifieth  her  nobility  by  being  conversant  with 
God:  yea  and  the  Lord  of  all  things  hath  loved  her. 

For  it  is  she  that  teacheth  the  knowledge  of  God,  and 
is  the  chooser  of  his  works. 

And  if  a  man  love  justice:  her  labours  have  great 
virtues;  for  she  teacheth  temperance,  and  prudence, 
and  justice,  and  fortitude,  which  are  such  things  as  men 
can  have  nothing  more  profitable  in  life. 

And  if  a  man  desireth  much  knowledge:  she  knoweth 
things  past,  and  judgeth  of  things  to  come:  she  knoweth 
the  subtilties  of  speeches,  and  the  solutions  of  argu- 


January   1 — The  Circumcision  421 

ments:  she  knoweth  signs  and  wonders  before  they  be 
done,  and  the  events  of  times  and  ages. 

I  purposed  therefore  to  take  her  to  me  to  live  with 
me:  knowing  that  she  will  communicate  to  me  of  her 
good  things,  and  will  be  a  comfort  in  my  cares  and 
grief. 

Thinking  these  things  with  myself,  and  pondering 
them  in  my  heart,  that  to  be  allied  to  wisdom  is  immor- 
tality. 

And  that  there  is  great  delight  in  her  friendship,  and 
inexhaustible  riches  in  the  works  of  her  hands,  and  in 
the  exercise  of  conference  with  her,  wisdom,  and  glory 
in  the  communication  of  her  words:  I  went  about  seek- 
ing, that  I  might  take  her  to  myself. 

As  I  knew  that  I  could  not  otherwise  be  continent, 
except  God  gave  it,  and  this  also  was  a  point  of  wisdom, 
to  know  whose  gift  it  was:  I  went  to  the  Lord,  and  be- 
sought him,  and  said  with  my  whole  heart: 

God  of  my  fathers,  and  Lord  of  mercy,  who  hast 
made  all  things  with  thy  word. 

And  by  thy  wisdom  hast  appointed  man,  that  he 
should  have  dominion  over  the  creature  that  was  made 
by  thee. 

That  he  should  order  the  world  according  to  equity 
and  justice,  and  execute  justice  with  an  upright  heart: 

Give  me  wisdom,  that  sitteth  by  thy  throne,  and  cast 
me  not  from  among  thy  children: 

For  I  am  thy  servant,  and  the  son  of  thy  handmaid. 

Send  her  out  of  thy  holy  heaven,  and  from  the  throne 
of  thy  majesty,  that  she  may  be  with  me,  and  my  labour 
with  me,  that  I  may  know  what  is  acceptable  with  thee: 

For  she  knoweth  and  understandeth  all  things,  and 
shall  lead  me  soberly  in  my  works,  and  shall  perserve 
me  by  her  power. 

For  the  thoughts  of  mortal  men  are  fearful;  and  our 
counsels  uncertain.

The  Matin  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (10:1-9) 

npHE  Lord  said  to  those  of  the  Jews  who  came  to 
him :  Amen,  Amen,  I  say  to  you :  He  that  enter- 
eth  not  by  the  door  into  the  sheep  fold,  but  climbeth  up 
another  way,  the  same  is  a  thief  and  a  robber. 

But  he  that  entereth  in  by  the  door  is  the  shepherd 
of  the  sheep. 

To  him  the  porter  openeth;  and  the  sheep  hear  his 
voice:  and  he  calleth  his  own  sheep  by  name,  and  lead- 
eth  them  out. 

And  when  he  hath  let  out  his  own  sheep,  he  goeth 
before  them :  and  the  sheep  follow  him,  because  they 
know  his  voice. 

But  a  stranger  they  follow  not,  but  fly  from  him,  be- 
cause they  know  not  the  voice  of  strangers. 


426  Menaion 

This  proverb  Jesus  spoke  to  them.  But  they  under- 
stood not  what  he  spoke  to  them. 

Jesus  therefore  said  to  them  again:  Amen,  amen,  I 
say  to  you,  I  am  the  door  of  the  sheep. 

All  others,  as  many  as  have  come,  are  thieves  and 
robbers :  and  the  sheep  heard  them  not. 

I  am  the  door.  By  me,  if  any  man  enter  in,  he  shall 
be  saved:  and  he  shall  go  in,  and  go  out,  and  shall  find 
pastures.

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  her  who  is  more  honourable, 
and  more  exalted  in  glory  than  the  heavenly  hosts. 
r\  THOU  blessed  and  all-pure  one,  in  whose  womb 
^^  was  incarnate  in  an  effable  manner,  the  God  rising 
before  the  sun,  coming  to  us  in  the  flesh,  thee,  O  Theo- 
tokos,  do  we  magnify. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  accepted  circumci- 
sion on  the  eighth  day. 

Verily,  Christ  having  passed  all  the  bounds  of  human 
nature,  was  born  of  the  Virgin  in  a  supernatural  man- 
ner and  was  circumcised  in  the  flesh,  fulfilling  the  law. 

Today  the  Lord  is  circumcised  in  the  flesh  and  his 
Name  was  called  Jesus. 

Come,  let  us  celebrate  in  holiness  the  glorious  nam- 
ing of  Christ;  for  he  was  called  today  Jesus,  as  worthy 
of  God,  and  withal  let  us  magnify  the  memory  of  the 
Bishop.

To  the  Saint,  in  the  Same  Tone 

By  John  Damascene 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  Basil,  the  Great  amongst 
Bishops. 

O  Father  Basil,  thou  didst  follow  in  the  life-bear- 
ing steps,  the  steps  of  Christ,  faithful  Head  of  shep- 
herds for  thou  didst  go  forth  and  offer  thyself  to  the 
usurper,  valiantly  endangering  thyself  for  the  Church, 
O  most-beatified. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  Basil  the  Great  of  Caesarea. 

Verily,  the  usurper,  having  seen  the  all-sanctified 
assembly,  the  assembly  of  the  Church  of  Christ,  adorned 
by  the  presidency  of  thy  Priesthood,  O  wise  one,  was 
confounded  and  fell  down,  utterly  perishing,  not  being 
able  to  bear  the  radiance  of  the  spirit  that  was  in  thee, 
O  Basil. 

Glory:  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  might  of  the  three- 
personed  and  indivisible  Trinity. 

Thou  hast  become  worthy,  O  Basil,  of  the  throne  of 
the  Apostles,  of  the  rank  of  the  strivers  for  Christ,  of 
the  paradise  of  the  righteous,  and  of  the  assembly  of 
the  Prophets;  for  thou  wast  an  initiate  of  the  Theo- 
tokos  and  a  servant  of  the  Trinity. 

Now:  Glorify,  O  my  soul,  the  Maiden  who  delivered 
us  from  the  curse. 

Verily,  the  Lord  who  alone  roofed  with  waters  his 
high  chambers,  bridled  the  sea  and  dried  up  the  waves, 
and  was  incarnate  of  thee,  O  pure  one,  doth  come  down 
from  Bethlehem  to  the  Jordan  to  be  baptised  in  the 
flesh.

T^HOU  hast  circumcised,  O  wise  Father  Basil,  the 
uncircumcision  of  thyself  with  the  love  of  phil- 
osophy; and  by  thy  wonders  thou  didst  appear  to  the

world  like  the  sun,  lighting  the  minds  of  believers, 
O  thou  of  divine  mind,  O  servant  of  the  Trinity  and 
initiate  of  the  Theotokos. 

Verily,  the  Creator  of  ages  who  fulfilled  the  law  is 
circumcised  in  the  flesh  like  an  eight-day  old  child,  is 
wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes  like  a  man,  and  fed  with 
milk,  he  who  is  the  All-controller  through  his  bound- 
less might,  since  he  is  God,  and  the  Maker  of  the  law  in 
flesh. 

CAnd  in  the  Einos,  the  following  four  Prosomia  are  sung  in  the 
Fifth  Tone. 

^\/^ERILY,  he  who  was  begotten  of  the  Father  in  an 
inexplicable  manner,  free  of  division  or  change, 
since  he  is  the  Word  and  God  of  God,  doth  bear  cir- 
cumcision in  the  flesh,  remaining  still  unchanged  in 
his  Divinity.  And  he  who  is  above  the  law  hath  sub- 
mitted to  it,  granting  the  blessing  from  on  high. 
Wherefore,  let  us  extol  him,  praising  his  condenscen- 
sion  of  transcendent  goodness,  and  glorify  him  grate- 
fully, beseeching  him  to  grant  our  souls  the  Great 
Mercy. 

When  thou  didst:  become,  O  righteous  one,  the 
adopted  son  of  God  by  rebirth,  that  is  divine  Baptism, 
thou  didst  confess  him  who  by  nature  and  truth  is  the 
Son  before  the  ages,  the  Word  of  God,  consubstantial 
and  coeternal  with  the  Father.  And  by  the  splendour 
of  thy  sayings  thou  didst  stop  the  open  mouths  of  here- 
tics. Wherefore,  thou  didst  dwell  in  the  celestial  king- 
doms, reigning  with  him  who  is  alone  King  by  nature, 
Christ,  who  distributeth  bountifully  to  the  world  the 
Great  Mercy. 

O  all-beatified  Basil,  the  righteous,  thou  didst  step 
within  the  heavenly  temple,  as  pure  chief  of  Priests, 
enwrapped  by  practice  and  theory  in  the  two  principles 
of  wisdom,  as  in  a  holy  vestment.  And  now  that  thou 
art  a  Priest  to  the  heavenly  Altar,  standing  before  God 
and  celebrating  the  immaterial  service,  remember,  O 


January  1 — The  Circumcision  429 

all-compassionate  one,  those  who  celebrate  thy  noble 
all-revered  memory,  pleading  with  Christ  who  granteth 
the  Great  Mercy. 

Since  thou  art  wholly  consecrated  to  God,  and  in  all 
thy  condition  consecrated  unto  him  from  thy  youth, 
thou  didst  hide  in  the  wisdom  transcending  wisdom, 
unfolding  the  knowledge  of  creation,  interpreting  it 
brilliantly,  and  conversing  thereof  in  the  ears  wisely, 
making  of  instruction  a  proposition  of  divine  knowl- 
edge. Wherefore,  do  we  proclaim  thee  as  theologian, 
divine  teacher,  a  radiance-bearing  star  of  the  Church, 
praising  Christ  who  granteth  the  Great  Mercy.

The  Epistle 

My  mouth  shall  speak  wisdom.  Hear  these  things, 
all  ye  nations. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Colossians  (2:8-12) 

URETHREN:  Beware  lest  any  man  cheat  you  by 
philosophy,  and  vain  deceit;  according  to  the  tra- 
dition of  men,  according  to  the  elements  of  the  world, 
and  not  according  to  Christ. 

For  in  him  dwelleth  all  the  fulness  of  the  Godhead 
corporeally; 

And  you  are  filled  in  him,  who  is  the  head  of  all 
principality  and  power: 

In  whom  also  you  are  circumcised  with  circumcision 
not  made  by  hand,  in  the  despoiling  of  the  body  of  the 
flesh,  but  in  the  circumcision  of  Christ: 

Buried  with  him  in  baptism,  in  whom  also  you  are 
risen  again  by  the  faith  of  the  operation  of  God,  who 
hath  raised  him  up  from  the  dead. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (2:20-21;  40  to  end) 

A  ND  it  came  to  pass  that  the  shepherds  returned, 
glorifying  and  praising  God,  for  the  things  they 
had  heard  and  seen,  as  it  was  told  unto  them. 

And  after  eight  days  were  accomplished,  that  the 
child  should  be  circumcised,  his  name  was  called  Jesus, 
which  was  called  by  the  angel,  before  he  was  conceived 
in  the  womb. 

And  the  child  grew,  and  waxed  strong,  full  of  wis- 
dom; and  the  grace  of  God  was  in  him. 


January   I-  -Tlv:  rircumcision  431 

And  his  parents  went  every  year  to  Jerusalem,  at  the 
solemn  day  of  the  pasch, 

And  when  he  was  twelve  years  od,  they  going  up 
into  Jerusalem,  according  to  the  custom  of  the  feast, 

And  having  fulfilled  the  days,  when  they  returned^ 
the  child  Jesus  remained  in  Jerusalem;  and  his  parents 
knew  it  not. 

And  thinking  that  he  was  in  the  company,  they  came 
a  day's  journey,  and  sought  him  among  their  kinsfolks 
and  acquaintance. 

And  not  finding  him,  they  returned  into  Jerusalem, 
seeking  him. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  after  three  days,  they  found 
him  in  the  temple,  sitting  in  the  midst  of  the  doctors, 
hearing  them,  and  asking  them  questions. 

And  all  that  heard  him  were  astonished  at  his  wis- 
dom and  his  answers. 

And  seeing  him,  they  wondered.  And  his  mother 
said  to  him:  Son,  why  hast  thou  done  so  to  us?  behold 
thy  father  and  I  have  sought  thee  sorrowing. 

And  he  said  to  them:  How  is  it  that  you  sought  me? 
did  you  not  know,  that  I  must  be  about  my  father's 
business? 

And  they  understood  not  the  word  that  he  spoke  unto 
them. 

And  he  went  down  with  them,  and  came  to  Nazareth, 
and  was  subject  to  them.  And  his  mother  kept  all  these 
words  in  her  heart. 

And  Jesus  advanced  in  wisdom,  and  age,  and  grace 
with  God  and  men.

I  be  afraid? 

Whilst  the  wicked  draw  near  against  me,  to  eat  my 
fliesh. 

My  enemies  that  trouble  me,  have  themselves  been 
weakened,  and  have  fallen. 

If  armies  in  camp  should  stand  together  against  me, 
my  heart  shall  not  fear. 

If  a  battle  should  rise  up  against  me,  in  this  will  I  be 
confident. 

One  thing  I  have  asked  of  the  Lord,  this  will  I  seek 
after;  that  I  may  dwell  in  the  house  of  the  Lord  all  the 
days  of  my  life. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  437 

That  I  may  see  the  delight  of  the  Lord,  and  may  visit 
his  temple. 

For  he  hath  hidden  me  in  his  tabernacle;  in  the  day 
of  evils,  he  hath  protected  me  in  the  secret  place  of  his 
tabernacle. 

He  hath  exalted  me  upon  a  rock:  and  now  he  hath 
lifted  up  my  head  above  my  enemies. 

I  have  gone  round,  and  have  offered  up  in  his  taber- 
nacle a  sacrifice  of  jubilation:  I  will  sing,  and  recite  a 
psalm  to  the  Lord. 

Hear,  O  Lord,  my  voice,  with  which  I  have  cried  to 
thee :  have  mercy  on  me  and  hear  me. 

My  heart  hath  said  to  thee:  My  face  hath  sought 
thee:  thy  face,  O  Lord,  will  I  still  seek. 

Turn  not  away  thy  face  from  me;  decline  not  in  thy 
wrath  from  thy  servant. 

Be  thou  my  helper,  forsake  me  not;  do  not  thou  de- 
spise me,  O  God  my  Saviour. 

For  my  father  and  my  mother  have  left  me :  but  the 
Lord  hath  taken  me  up. 

Set  me,  O  Lord,  a  law  in  thy  way,  and  guide  me  in 
the  right  path,  because  of  my  enemies. 

Deliver  me  not  over  to  the  will  of  them  that  trouble 
me;  for  unjust  witnesses  have  risen  up  against  me;  and 
iniquity  hath  lied  to  itself. 

I  believe  to  see  the  good  things  of  the  Lord  in  the 
land  of  the  living. 

Expect  the  Lord,  do  manfully,  and  let  thy  heart  take 
courage,  and  wait  thou  for  the  Lord.

from  flowing;  the  Matser  being  shown  washed  therein. 

Stichos:  Therefore  will  I  remember  thee  from  the 
land  of  the  Jordan. 

Thou  didst  come  to  the  river  like  a  man,  O  Christ 
King.  Thou  dost  hasten,  O  good  One,  to  receive  bap- 
tism as  a  servant  at  the  hands  of  the  Forerunner,  for 
our  sins,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

nnOWARD  the  voice  in  the  wilderness.  Prepare  ye 
the  way  of  the  Lord  thou  didst  come  taking  the  like- 
ness of  a  servant,  seeking  baptism,  O  thou  who  knowest 
no  sin.  The  waters  saw  thee  and  were  afraid,  and  the 
Forerunner  trembled  and  cried,  saying.  How  shall  the 
Light  seek  to  be  lighted  for  the  lamp?  How  shall  the 
servant  place  his  hand  upon  the  Master?  Wherefore, 
sanctify  me  and  the  waters,  O  Saviour,  carrying  the  sin 
of  the  world. 

Prokeimenon  of  the  Prophecy,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  is  upon  many  waters.  I  will 
love  thee,  O  Lord,  my  strength. 

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  (35:1  to  end) 

npHESE  things,  the  Lord  doth  say:  The  Land  that 

was  desolate  and  impassable  shall  be  glad;  and  the 

wilderness  shall  rejoice,  and  shall  flourish  like  the  lily. 

It  shall  bud  forth  and  blossom,  and  shall  rejoice  with 
joy  and  praise:  the  glory  of  Libanus  is  given  to  it:  the 
beauty  of  Carmel,  and  Saron,  they  shall  see  the  glory 
of  the  Lord,  and  the  beauty  of  our  God. 

Strengthen  ye  the  feeble  hands,  and  confirm  the  weak 
knees. 

Say  to  the  fainthearted:  Take  courage,  and  fear  not: 
behold  your  God  will  bring  the  revenge  of  recompense: 
God  himself  will  come  and  will  save  you. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  439 

Then  shall  the  eyes  of  the  blind  be  opened,  and  the 
ears  of  the  deaf  shall  be  unstopped. 

Then  shall  the  lame  man  leap  as  a  hart,  and  the 
tongue  of  the  dumb  shall  be  free :  for  waters  are  broken 
out  in  the  desert,  and  streams  in  the  wilderness. 

And  that  which  was  dry  land,  shall  become  a  pool, 
and  the  thirsty  land  springs  of  water.  In  the  dens  where 
dragons  dwelt  before,  shall  rise  up  the  verdure  of  the 
reed  and  the  bulrush. 

And  a  path  and  a  way  shall  be  there,  and  it  shall  be 
called  the  holy  way:  the  unclean  shall  not  pass  over  it, 
and  this  shall  be  unto  you  a  straight  way,  so  that  fools 
shall  not  err  therein. 

No  lion  shall  be  there,  nor  shall  any  mischievous 
beast  go  up  by  it,  nor  be  found  there:  but  they  shall 
walk  there  that  shall  be  delivered. 

And  the  redeemed  of  the  Lord  shall  return,  and  shall 
come  into  Sion  with  praise,  and  everlasting  joy  shall 
be  upon  their  heads :  they  shall  obtain  joy  and  gladness, 
and  sorrow  and  mourning  shall  flee  away. 

The  Epistle:  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (13:25-23) 

A  ND  it  came  to  pass  that  when  John  was  fulfilling 
his  course  he  said:  I  am  not  he,  whom  you  think 
me  to  be:  but  behold,  there  cometh  one  after  me,  whose 
shoes  of  his  feet  I  am  not  worthy  to  loose. 

Men,  brethren,  children  of  the  stock  of  Abraham, 
and  whosoever  among  you  fear  God,  to  you  the  word 
of  this  salvation  is  sent. 

For  they  that  inhabited  Jerusalem,  and  the  rulers 
thereof,  not  knowing  him,  nor  the  voices  of  the 
prophets,  which  are  read  every  sabbath,  judging  him 
have  fulfilled  them. 

And  finding  no  cause  of  death  in  him,  they  desired 
of  Pilate,  that  they  might  kill  him. 

And  when  they  had  fulfilled  all  things  that  were 
written  of  him,  taking  him  down  from  the  tree,  they 
laid  him  in  a  sepulchre. 

But  God  raised  him  up  from  the  dead  the  third  day: 


440  Menaion 

Who  was  seen  for  many  days,  by  them  who  came  up 
with  him  from  Galilee  to  Jerusalem,  who  to  this  pres- 
ent are  his  witnesses  to  the  people. 

And  we  declare  unto  you,  that  the  promise  wihch  was 
made  to  our  fathers, 

This  same  God  hath  fulfilled  to  our  children,  raising 
up  Jesus. 

The  Gospel:  from  St,  Matthew  (3:1-6) 

A  ND  in  those  days  cometh  John  the  Baptist  preach- 
ing  in  the  desert  of  Judaea. 

And  saying:  Do  penance:  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven 
is  at  hand. 

For  this  is  he  that  was  spoken  of  by  Isaias  the 
prophet,  saying:  A  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  desert, 
Prepare  ye  the  way  of  the  Lord,  make  straight  his  paths. 

And  the  same  John  had  his  garment  of  camel's  hair, 
and  a  leathern  girdle  about  his  loins:  and  his  meat  was 
locusts  and  wild  honey. 

Then  went  out  to  him  Jerusalem  and  all  Judaea,  and 
all  the  country  about  Jordan: 

And  were  baptized  by  him  in  the  Jordan,  confessing 
their  sins.

January  6 — The  Epiphany  441 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  is  upon  the  waters;  the  God 
of  majesty  hath  thundered,  The  Lord  is  upon  many 
waters. 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  is  in  power;  the  voice  of  the 
Lord  in  magnificence. 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  breaketh  the  cedars :  yea,  the 
Lord  shall  break  the  cedars  of  Libanus. 

And  shall  reduce  them  to  pieces,  as  a  calf  of  Libanus, 
and  as  the  beloved  son  of  unicorns. 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  divideth  the  flame  of  fire :  The 
voice  of  the  Lord  shaketh  the  desert:  and  the  Lord  shall 
shake  the  desert  of  Cades. 

The  voice  of  the  Lord  prepareth  the  stags:  and  he 
will  discover  the  thick  woods:  and  in  his  temple  all 
shall  speak  his  glory. 

The  Lord  maketh  the  flood  to  dwell:  and  the  Lord 
shall  sit  king  for  ever. 

The  Lord  will  give  strength  to  his  people:  the  Lord 
will  bless  his  people  with  peace. 

Psalm  41 

AS  the  hart  panteth  after  the  fountains  of  waters; 
so  my  soul  panteth  after  thee,  O  God. 

My  soul  hath  thirsted  after  the  strong  living  God; 
when  shall  I  come  and  appear  before  the  face  of  God? 

My  tears  have  been  my  bread  day  and  night,  whilst 
it  is  said  to  me  daily:  Where  is  thy  God? 

These  things  I  remembered,  and  poured  out  my  soul 
in  me:  for  I  shall  go  over  into  the  place  of  the  wonder- 
ful tabernacle,  even  to  the  house  of  God: 

With  the  voice  of  joy  and  praise;  the  noise  of  one 
feasting. 

Why  art  thou  sad,  O  my  soul?  and  why  dost  thou 
trouble  me? 

Hope  in  God,  for  I  will  still  give  praise  to  him:  the 
salvation  of  my  countenance,  and  my  God.

My  soul  is  troubled  within  myself :  therefore  will  I

Deep  calleth  on  deep,  at  the  noise  of  thy  flood-gates. 

All  thy  heights  and  thy  billows  have  passed  over  me. 

In  the  daytime  the  Lord  hath  commanded  his  mercy; 
and  a  canticle  to  him  in  the  night. 

With  me  is  prayer  to  the  God  of  my  life.  I  will  say 
to  God :  Thou  art  my  support. 

Why  hast  thou  forgotten  me?  and  why  go  I  mourn- 
ing, whilst  my  enemy  afflicteth  me? 

Whilst  my  bones  are  broken,  my  enemies  who  trou- 
ble me  have  reproached  me; 

Whilst  they  say  to  me  day  by  day:  Where  is  thy  God? 

Why  art  thou  cast  down,  O  my  soul?  and  why  dost 
thou  disquiet  me? 

Hope  thou  in  God,  for  I  will  still  give  praise  to  him: 
the  salvation  of  my  countenance,  and  my  God.

from  heaven  in  the  likeness  of  a  dove,  and  the  son  bowed 
his  pure  head  to  the  Forerunner,  and  being  baptized  did 
save  mankind  from  captivity,  since  he  is  the  Lover  of

thee,  and  the  divine  Spirit  did  come  to  thee  in  the  like-

Lover  of  mankind. 

Prokeimenon  of  the  Prophecy,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

The  waters  saw  thee,  O  God.  The  voice  of  the  Lord

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  (1:16-20) 

nPHESE  things  the  Lord  doth  say.  Wash  yourselves, 
be  clean,  take  away  the  evil  of  your  devices  from 
my  eyes :  cease  to  do  perversely. 

Learn  to  do  well:  seek  judgment,  relieve  the  op- 
pressed, judge  for  the  fatherless,  defend  the  widow. 

And  then  come,  and  accuse  me,  saith  the  Lord :  if 
your  sins  be  as  scarlet,  they  shall  be  made  as  white  as 
snow:  and  if  they  be  red  as  crimson,  they  shall  be  white 
as  wool. 

If  you  be  willing,  and  will  hearken  to  me,  you  shall 
eat  the  good  things  of  the  land. 

But  if  you  will  not,  and  will  provoke  me  to  wrath: 
the  sword  shall  devour  you  because  the  mouth  of  the 
Lord  hath  spoken  it.

The  Epistle:  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (19:1-8) 

A  ND  it  came  to  pass,  while  Apollos  was  at  Corinth, 
that  Paul  having  passed  through  the  upper  coasts, 
came  to  Ephesus  and  found  certain  disciples. 

And  he  said  to  them:  Have  you  received  the  Holy 
Spirit  since  ye  believed?  But  they  said  to  him:  We 
have  not  so  much  as  heard  whether  there  be  a  Holy 
Spirit. 

And  he  said :  In  what  then  were  you  baptized?  Who 
said:  In  John's  baptism. 

Then  Paul  said :  John  baptized  the  people  with  the 
baptism  of  penance,  saying:  That  they  should  believe 
in  him  who  was  to  come  after  him,  that  is  to  say,  in 
Jesus. 

Having  heard  these  things,  they  were  baptized  in  the 
name  of  the  Lord  Jesus. 

And  when  Paul  had  imposed  his  hands  on  them,  the 
Holy  Spirit  came  upon  them,  and  they  spoke  with 
tongues  and  prophesied. 

And  all  the  men  were  about  twelve. 

And  entering  into  the  synagogue,  he  spoke  boldly 
for  the  space  of  three  months,  disputing  and  exhorting 
concerning  the  kingdom  of  God.

Psalm  73 
r\  GOD,  why  hast  thou  cast  us  off  unto  the  end? 
^^  why  is  thy  wrath  enkindled  against  the  sheep  of 
thy  pasture? 

Remember  thy  congregation,  which  thou  hast  pos- 
sessed from  the  beginning. 

The  sceptre  of  thy  inheritance  which  thou  hast  re- 
deemed:  mount  Sion  in  which  thou  hast  dwelt. 

Lift  up  thy  hands  against  their  pride  unto  the  end; 
see  what  things  the  enemy  hath  done  wickedly  in  the 
sanctuary. 

And  they  that  hate  thee  have  made  their  boasts,  in 
the  midst  of  thy  solemnity. 

They  have  set  up  their  ensigns  for  signs,  and  they 
knew  not  both  in  the  going  out  and  on  the  highest  top. 

As  with  axes  in  a  wood  of  trees,  they  have  cut  down 
at  once  the  gates  thereof,  with  axe  and  hatchet  they 
have  brought  it  down. 

They  have  set  fire  to  thy  sanctuary:  they  have  defiled 
the  dwelling  place  of  thy  name  on  the  earth. 

They  said  in  their  heart,  the  whole  kindred  of  them 
together:  Let  us  abolish  all  the  festival  days  of  God 
from  the  land. 

Our  signs  we  have  not  seen,  there  is  now  no  prophet: 
and  he  will  know  us  no  more. 

How  long,  O  God,  shall  the  enemy  reproach :  is  the 
adversary  to  provoke  thy  name  for  ever? 

Why  dost  thou  turn  away  thy  hand :  and  thy  right 
hand  out  of  the  midst  of  thy  bosom  for  ever? 

But  God  is  our  king  before  ages:  he  hath  wrought 
salvation  in  the  midst  of  the  earth. 

Thou  by  thy  strength  didst  make  the  sea  firm :  thou 
didst  crush  the  heads  of  the  dragons  in  the  waters. 

Thou  hast  broken  the  heads  of  the  dragon:  thou  hast 
given  him  to  be  meat  for  the  people  of  the  Ethiopians. 

Thou  hast  broken  up  the  fountains  and  the  torrents: 
thou  hast  dried  up  the  Ethan  rivers. 

Thine  is  the  day,  and  thine  is  the  night:  thou  hast 
made  the  morning  light  and  the  sun. 


446  Menaion 

Thou  hast  made  all  the  borders  of  the  earth :  the  sum- 
mer and  the  spring  were  formed  by  thee. 

Remember  this,  the  enemy  hath  reproached  the 
Lord :  and  a  foolish  people  hath  provoked  thy  name. 

Deliver  not  up  to  beasts  the  souls  that  confess  to  thee: 
and  forget  not  to  the  end  the  souls  of  thy  poor. 

Have  regard  to  thy  covenant:  for  they  that  are  the 
obscure  of  the  earth  have  been  filled  with  dwellings 
of  iniquity. 

Let  not  the  humble  be  turned  away  with  confusion : 
the  poor  and  needy  shall  praise  thy  name. 

Arise,  O  God,  judge  thy  own  cause:  remember  thy 
reproaches  with  which  the  foolish  man  hath  reproached 
thee  all  the  day. 

Forget  not  the  voices  of  thy  enemies:  the  pride  of 
them  that  hate  thee  ascendeth  continually. 

Psalm  76 

T   CRIED  to  the  Lord  with  my  voice;  to  God  with 

my  voice;  and  he  gave  ear  to  me. 

In  the  day  of  my  trouble  I  sought  God,  with  my 
hands  lifted  up  to  him  in  the  night,  and  I  was  not 
deceived. 

My  soul  refused  to  be  comforted:  I  remembered 
God,  and  was  delighted,  and  was  exercised,  and  my 
spirit  swooned  away. 

My  eyes  prevented  the  watches :  I  was  troubled,  and 
I  spoke  not. 

I  thought  upon  the  days  of  old:  and  I  had  in  my 
mind  the  eternal  years. 

And  I  meditated  in  the  night  with  my  own  heart: 
and  I  was  exercised  and  I  swept  my  spirit. 

Will  God  then  cast  off  for  ever?  or  will  he  never  be 
more  favourable  again? 

Or  will  he  cut  off  his  mercy  for  ever,  from  genera- 
tion to  generation? 

Or  will  God  forget  to  shew  mercy?  or  will  he  in  his 
anger  shut  up  his  mercies? 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  447 

And  I  said,  Now  have  I  begun:  this  is  the  change  of 
the  right  hand  of  the  most  High. 

I  remembered  the  works  of  the  Lord:  for  I  will  be 
mindful  of  thy  wonders  from  the  beginning. 

And  I  will  meditate  on  all  thy  works:  and  will  be 
employed  in  thy  inventions. 

Thy  way,  O  God,  is  in  the  holy  place:  who  is  the 
great  God  like  our  God?  Thou  art  the  God  that  doest 
wonders. 

Thou  hast  made  thy  power  known  among  the  na- 
tions :  with  thy  arm  thou  hast  redeemed  thy  people  the 
children  of  Jacob  and  of  Joseph. 

The  waters  saw  thee,  O  God,  the  waters  saw  thee: 
and  they  were  afraid,  and  the  depths  were  troubled. 

Great  was  the  noise  of  the  waters:  the  clouds  sent 
out  a  sound. 

For  thy  arrows  pass:  the  voice  of  thy  thunder  in  a 
wheel. 

Thy  lightnings  enlightened  the  world :  the  earth 
shook  and  trembled. 

Thy  way  is  in  the  sea,  and  thy  paths  in  many  waters : 
and  thy  footsteps  shall  not  be  known. 

Thou  hast  conducted  thy  people  like  sheep,  by  the 
hand  of  Moses  and  Aaron.

head  and  falter  not,  O  Prophet.  Let  be  now;  for  I

eternal  life,  since  I  am  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:  Therefore  will  I  remember  thee  from  the 
land  of  Jordan  (in  the  Sixth  Tone). 

Today  it  is  time  for  the  prophecy  of  the  Psalms  to 
take  effect;  for  it  saith  that  the  sea  beheld  and  ran 
away;  and  Jordan  turned  back  from  the  face  of  the 
Lord,  from  the  face  of  the  God  of  Jacob,  who  cometh  to 
accept  baptism  from  a  servant,  so  that  having  been 
washed  from  abominable  idolatry,  our  souls  may  be 
illuminated  by  him. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

TT/HY  are  thy  waters  troubled,  O  Jordan,  and  why 
turnest  thou  backward,  not  proceeding  forward 
according  to  thy  natural  flow?  It  shall  answer,  saying, 
I  cannot  bear  a  consuming  fire.  Therefore,  do  I  marvel 
and  tremble  at  thy  exceeding  condescension;  for  I  am 
not  accustomed  to  wash  the  Pure;  I  have  not  learned 
to  purify  the  sinless  One;  but  to  purify  impure  vessels; 
for  Christ  who  baptized  in  me  doth  teach  me  to  burn 
the  thorns  of  sins.  And  John,  the  voice  of  the  Word, 
doth  testify  with  me,  crying.  Behold  the  Lamb  of  God 
who  beareth  the  sin  of  the  world.  Let  us  believers 
therefore  cry  unto  him,  saying,  O  God  that  hath  ap- 
peared for  our  salvation,  glory  to  thee.

HTHESE  things  the  Lord  doth  say:  You  shall  draw

And  you  shall  say  in  that  day:  Praise  ye  the  Lord,

the  people:  remember  that  his  name  is  high. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  449 

.  Sing  ye  to  the  Lord,  for  he  hath  done  great  things: 
show  this  forth  in  all  the  earth. 

Rejoice,  and  praise,  O  thou  habitation  of  Sion:  for 
great  is  he  that  is  in  the  midst  of  thee,  the  Holy  One 
of  Israel. 

The  Epistle:  from  St.  Paul  to  the  Romans  (6:3-11) 

T>RETHREN,  know  you  not  that  all  we,  who  are 
^^  baptized  in  Christ  Jesus,  are  baptized  into  his 
death? 

For  we  are  buried  together  with  him  by  baptism  into 
death;  that  as  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead  by  the  glory 
of  the  Father,  so  we  also  may  walk  in  newness  of  life. 

For  if  we  have  been  planted  together  in  the  likeness 
of  his  death,  we  shall  be  also  in  the  likeness  of  his  resur- 
rection. 

Knowing  this,  that  our  old  man  is  crucified  with  him, 
that  the  body  of  sin  may  be  destroyed,  to  the  end  that 
we  may  serve  sin  no  longer. 

For  he  that  is  dead  is  justified  from  sin. 

Now  if  we  be  dead  with  Christ,  we  believe  that  we 
shall  live  also  together  with  Christ: 

Knowing  that  Christ  rising  again  from  the  dead, 
dieth  now  no  more,  death  shall  no  more  have  dominion 
over  him. 

For  in  that  he  died  to  sin,  he  died  once;  but  in  that 
he  liveth,  he  liveth  unto  God. 

So  do  you  also  reckon,  that  you  are  dead  to  sin,  but 
alive  unto  God,  in  Christ  Jesus  our  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (1:9-11) 

A  ND  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days,  Jesus  came  from 
Nazareth  of  Galilee,  and  was  baptized  by  John 
in  the  Jordan. 

And  forthwith  coming  up  out  of  the  water,  he  saw 
the  heavens  opened,  and  the  Spirit  as  a  dove  descend- 
ing, and  remaining  on  him.

TPHE  Lord,  hath  reigned,  he  is  clothed  with  beauty: 
the  Lord  is  clothed  with  strength,  and  hath  girded 
himself. 

For  he  hath  established  the  world  which  shall  not 
be  moved. 

Thy  throne  is  prepared  from  of  old :  thou  art  from 
everlasting. 

The  floods  have  lifted  up,  O  Lord:  the  floods  have 
lifted  up  their  voice. 

The  floods  have  lifted  up  their  waves,  with  the  noise 
of  many  waters. 

Wonderful  are  the  surges  of  the  sea :  wonderful  is  the 
Lord  on  high. 

Thy  testimonies  are  become  exceedingly  credible: 
holiness  becometh  thy  house,  O  Lord,  unto  length  of 
days. 

Psalm  113 

V\/^HEN  Israel  went  out  of  Egypt,  the  house  of  Jacob 
from  a  barbarous  people: 

Judea  was  made  this  sanctuary,  Israel  his  dominion. 

The  sea  saw  and  fled :  Jordan  was  turned  back. 

The  mountains  skipped  like  rams,  and  the  hills  like 
the  lambs  of  the  flock. 

What  ailed  thee,  O  thou  sea,  that  thou  didst  flee:  and 
thou,  O  Jordan,  that  thou  wast  turned  back? 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  451 

Ye  mountains,  that  ye  skipped  like  rams,  and  ye  hills, 
like  lambs  of  the  flock? 

At  the  presence  of  the  Lord  the  earth  was  moved,  at 
the  presence  of  the  God  of  Jacob: 

Who  turned  the  rock  into  pools  of  water,  and  the 
stony  hill  into  fountains  of  waters. 

Not  to  us,  O  Lord,  not  to  us;  but  to  thy  name  give 
glory. 

For  thy  mercy,  and  for  thy  truth's  sake :  lest  the  Gen- 
tiles should  say:  Where  is  their  God? 

But  our  God  is  in  heaven:  he  hath  done  all  things 
whatsoever  he  would. 

The  idols  of  the  Gentiles  are  silver  and  gold,  the 
works  of  the  hands  of  men. 

They  have  mouths  and  speak  not :  they  have  eyes  and 
see  not. 

They  have  ears  and  hear  not:  they  have  noses  and 
smell  not. 

They  have  hands  and  feel  not:  they  have  feet  and 
walk  not:  neither  shall  they  cry  out  through  their 
throat. 

Let  them  that  make  them  become  like  unto  them : 
and  all  such  as  trust  in  them. 

The  house  of  Israel  hath  hoped  in  the  Lord:  he  is 
their  helper  and  protector. 

The  house  of  Aaron  hath  hoped  in  the  Lord:  he  is 
their  helper  and  their  protector. 

They  that  fear  the  Lord  have  hoped  in  the  Lord :  he 
is  their  helper  and  their  protector. 

The  Lord  hath  been  mindful  of  us,  and  hath  blessed 
us. 

He  hath  blessed  the  house  of  Israel :  he  hath  blessed 
the  house  of  Aaron. 

He  hath  blessed  all  that  fear  the  Lord,  both  little  and 
great. 

May  the  Lord  add  blessings  upon  you  :  upon  you,  and 
upon  your  children. 

Blessed  be  you  of  the  Lord,  who  made  heaven  and 
earth.

forgiveness  of  sins  hath  come  to  the  earth  from  a  pure 
Virgin,  of  his  own  mercy.  Wherefore,  he  maketh  us 
sons  of  God  instead  of  servants;  and  instead  of  dark-

heard  thee,  and  in  the  day  of  salvation  I  have 
helped  thee;  and  I  have  preserved  thee,  and  given  thee 
to  be  a  covenant  of  the  people,  that  thou  mightest  raise 
up  the  earth  and  possess  the  inheritances  that  were 
destroyed. 

That  thou  mightest  say  to  them  that  are  bound: 
Come  forth :  and  to  them  that  are  in  darkness :  Show 
yourselves.  They  shall  feed  in  the  ways,  and  their 
pastures  shall  be  in  every  plain. 

They  shall  not  hunger,  nor  thirst,  neither  shall  the 
heat  nor  the  sun  strike  them :  for  he  that  is  merciful  to 
them,  shall  be  their  shepherd,  and  at  the  fountains  of 
waters  he  shall  give  them  drink. 

And  I  will  make  all  my  mountains  a  way,  and  my 
paths  shall  be  exalted. 

Behold  these  shall  come  from  afar,  and  behold  these 
from  the  north  and  from  the  sea,  and  these  from  the 
south  country. 

Give  praise,  O  ye  heavens,  and  rejoice,  O  earth,  ye 
mountains,  give  praise  with  jubilation:  because  the 
Lord  hath  comforted  his  people,  and  will  have  mercy 
on  his  poor  ones.

Instructing  us,  that,  denying  ungodliness  and  worldly 
desires,  we  should  live  soberly,  and  justly,  and  godly  in 
this  world. 

Looking  for  the  blessed  hope  and  coming  of  the  glory 
of  the  great  God  and  our  Saviour  Jesus  Christ. 

Who  gave  himself  for  us,  that  he  might  redeem  us 
from  all  iniquity,  and  might  cleanse  to  himself  a  peo- 
ple acceptable,  a  pursuer  of  good  works.

authority.    Let  no  man  despise  thee. 

But  when  the  goodness  and  kindness  of  God  our  Sav- 
iour appeared: 

Not  by  the  works  of  justice,  which  we  have  done,  but 
according  to  his  mercy,  he  saved  us,  by  the  laver  of 
regeneration,  and  renovation  of  the  Holy  Spirit; 

Whom  he  hath  poured  forth  upon  us  abundantly, 
through  Jesus  Christ  our  Saviour: 

That,  being  justified  by  his  grace,  we  may  be  heirs, 
according  to  hope  of  life  everlasting.

Under  the  high  priests  Annas  and  Caiphas;  the  word 
of  the  Lord  was  made  unto  John,  the  son  of  Zachary, 
in  the  desert. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  455 

And  he  came  into  all  the  country  about  the  Jordan^ 
preaching  the  baptism  of  penance  for  the  remission  of 
sins; 

As  it  was  written  in  the  book  of  the  sayings  of  Isaias 
the  prophet:  A  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilderness: 
Prepare  ye  the  way  of  the  Lord,  make  straight  his  paths. 

Every  valley  shall  be  filled;  and  every  mountain  and 
hill  shall  be  brought  low;  and  the  crooked  shall  be 
made  straight;  and  the  rough  ways  plain; 

And  all  flesh  shall  see  the  salvation  of  God. 

He  said  therefore  to  the  multitudes  that  went  forth 
to  be  baptized  by  him:  Ye  offspring  of  vipers,  who 
hath  showed  you  to  flee  from  the  wrath  to  come? 

Bring  forth  therefore  fruits  worthy  of  penance;  and 
do  not  begin  to  say,  We  have  Abraham  for  our  father. 
For  I  say  unto  you,  that  God  is  able  of  these  stones  to 
raise  up  children  to  Abraham. 

For  now  the  axe  is  laid  to  the  root  of  the  trees. 
Every  tree  therefore  that  bringeth  not  forth  good  fruit, 
shall  be  cut  down  and  cast  into  the  fire. 

And  the  people  asked  him,  saying:  What  then  shall 
we  do? 

And  he  answering,  said  to  them:  He  that  hath  two 
coats,  let  him  give  to  him  that  hath  none;  and  he  that 
hath  meat,  let  him  do  in  like  manner. 

And  the  publicans  also  came  to  be  baptized,  and 
said  to  him:  Master,  what  shall  we  do? 

But  he  said  to  them :  Do  nothing  more  than  that 
which  is  appointed  you. 

And  the  soldiers  also  asked  him,  saying:  And  what 
shall  we  do?  And  he  said  to  them:  Do  violence  to  no 
man;  neither  calumniate  any  man;  and  be  content  with 
your  pay. 

And  as  the  people  were  of  opinion,  and  all  were 
thinking  in  their  hearts  of  John,  that  perhaps  he  might 
be  the  Christ; 

John  answered,  saying  unto  all:  I  indeed  baptize 
you  with  water;  but  there  shall  come  one  mightier  than 


456  Menaion 

I,  the  latchet  of  whose  shoes  I  am  not  worthy  to  loose:

and  will  gather  the  wheat  into  his  barn;  but  the  chaff 
he  will  burn  with  unquenchable  fire. 

And  many  other  things  exhorting,  did  he  preach  to 
the  people.

4[,0n  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sing  the  following  six  Idiomelons, 
in  the  Second  Tone. 

By  John  the  Damascene 

TT/HEN  the  Forerunner  saw  him  who  is  our  Illumi- 
nation, who  doth  illuminate  every  man,  coming 
to  be  baptized,  his  soul  rejoiced,  and  his  hand  trembled. 
Then,  pointing  to  him  he  said  to  the  people.  Behold  the 
Rescuer  of  Israel,  who  delivereth  us  from  corruption. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ  our  God,  who  art  sinless;  glory 
to  thee.    (Repeat.) 

The  hosts  of  the  angels  trembled  when  they  beheld 
our  Redeemer  being  baptized  by  a  servant,  and  testi- 
fied to  by  the  presence  of  the  Spirit,  while  a  heavenly 
voice  from  the  Father  cried,  saying,  Verily,  this  One 
on  whom  the   Forerunner  placeth   his  hands,   is  my 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  457 


beloved  Son  in  whom  I  am  well  pleased.  Wherefore, 
O  Christ  our  God,  glory  to  thee.     (Repeat,) 

The  courses  of  the  Jordan  received  thee,  O  Fountain; 
and  the  Comforter  descended  in  the  likeness  of  a  dove. 
Yea,  he  who  bowed  the  heavens,  boweth  his  own  head; 
and  the  clay  crieth  unto  the  potter,  saying.  How  dost 
thou  command  me;  to  do  what  is  more  exalted  than  my 
station?  It  is  I  who  need  to  be  baptized  by  thee. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ  God,  who  art  sinless,  glory  to  thee. 

When  thou  didst  choose  to  save  lost  man,  thou  didst 
not  disdain  to  put  on  the  likeness  of  a  servant;  for  it 
was  meet  for  thee,  O  Lord  God,  to  accept  what  is  ours 
for  our  sakes;  for  when  thou  wast  baptized  in  the  flesh, 
O  Redeemer,  thou  didst  make  us  worthy  of  forgive-

(2:6-14) 

A  ND  Elias  said  to  Eliseus:  Stay  here,  because  the 
^  ^  Lord  hath  sent  me  as  far  as  the  Jordan.  And  he 
said :  As  the  Lord  liveth,  and  as  thy  soul  liveth,  I  will 
not  leave  thee.    And  they  two  went  on  together. 

And  fifty  men  of  the  sons  of  the  prophets  followed 
them,  and  stood  in  sight  at  a  distance :  but  they  two  stood 
by  the  Jordan. 

And  Elias  took  his  mantle  and  folded  it  together,  and 
struck  the  waters,  and  they  were  divided  hither  and 
thither,  and  they  both  passed  over  on  dry  land. 

And  when  they  were  gone  over,  Elias  said  to  Eliseus : 
Ask  what  thou  wilt  have  me  to  do  for  thee,  before  I  be 
taken  away  from  thee.  And  Eliseus  said :  I  beseech 
thee  that  in  me  may  be  thy  double  spirit. 

And  he  answered:  Thou  hast  asked  a  hard  thing: 
nevertheless  if  thou  see  me  when  I  am  taken  from  thee, 
thou  shalt  have  what  thou  hast  asked  :  but  if  thou  see  me 
not,  thou  shalt  not  have  it. 

And  as  they  went  on,  walking  and  talking  together, 
behold  a  fiery  chariot,  and  fiery  horses  parted  them  both 
asunder :  and  Elias  went  up  by  a  whirlwind  into  heaven. 

And  Eliseus  saw  him,  and  cried :  My  father,  my 
father,  the  chariot  of  Israel,  and  the  driver  thereof. 
And  he  saw  him  no  more :  and  he  took  hold  of  his  own 
garments,  and  rent  them  in  two  pieces. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  459 

And  he  took  up  the  mantle  of  Elias,  that  fell  from 
him:  and  going  back,  he  stood  upon  the  bank  of  the 
Jordan, 

And  he  struck  the  waters  with  the  mantle  of  Elias, 
that  had  fallen  from  him,  and  they  were  divided,  hither 
and  thither,  and  Eliseus  passed  over.

\  ND  the  men  of  the  city  of  Jericho  said  to  Eliseus: 
Behold  the  situation  of  this  city  is  very  good,  as  my 
lord  seest:  but  the  waters  are  very  bad,  and  the  ground 
barren. 

And  he  said:  Bring  me  a  new  vessel,  and  put  salt 
into  it.    And  when  they  had  brought  it. 

He  went  out  to  the  spring  of  the  waters,  and  cast  the 
salt  into  it,  and  said :  Thus  saith  the  Lord  :  I  have  healed 
these  waters,  and  there  shall  be  no  more  in  them  death 
or  barrenness.

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  People 
of  Corinth  (9:19  to  end) 

T>RETHREN:  Whereas  I  was  free  as  to  all,  I  made 
myself  the  servant  of  all,  that  I  might  gain  the  more, 

And  I  became  to  the  Jews,  a  Jew,  that  I  might  gain 
the  Jews : 

To  them  that  are  under  the  law,  as  if  I  were  under 
the  law,  (whereas  myself  was  not  under  the  law,)  that 
I  might  gain  them  that  were  without  the  law.  To  them 
that  were  without  the  law,  as  if  I  were  without  the  law, 
(whereas  I  was  not  without  the  law  of  God,  but  was  in 
the  law  of  Christ,)  that  I  might  gain  them  that  were 
without  the  law. 

To  the  weak  I  became  weak,  that  I  might  gain  the 
weak.  I  became  all  things  to  all  men,  that  I  might 
save  all. 

And  I  do  all  things  for  the  gospel's  sake:  that  I  may 
be  made  partaker  thereof. 

Know  you  not  that  they  that  run  in  the  race,  all  run 
indeed,  but  one  receiveth  the  prize?  So  run  that  you 
may  obtain. 

And  every  one  that  striveth  for  the  mastery,  refrain- 
eth  himself  from  all  things :  and  they  may  receive  a  cor- 
ruptible crown;  but  we  an  incorruptible  one. 

I  therefore  so  run,  not  as  at  an  uncertainty:  I  so  fight, 
not  as  one  beating  the  air: 

But  I  chastise  my  body,  and  bring  it  into  subjection: 
lest  perhaps,  when  I  have  preached  to  others,  I  myself 
should  become  a  castaway.

By  Sophronius  the  J erusalemite  Patriarch 

T^HE  voice  of  the  Lord  upon  the  waters  crieth,  say- 
ing, Come  ye  all  and  take  the  spirit  of  wisdom, 
the  spirit  of  understanding,  the  spirit  of  the  fear  of 
God,  by  the  appearance  of  Christ. 

Today  the  nature  of  water  is  sanctified,  and  the  Jor- 
dan is  cloven,  and  its  waters  shall  be  held  from  flow- 
ing, the  Master  being  shown  washed  therein. 

Thou  didst  come  to  the  river  like  a  man,  O  Christ 
King.  Thou  dost  hasten,  O  good  One,  to  receive  bap- 
tism as  a  servant  at  the  hands  of  the  Forerunner,  for 
our  sins,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Glory  and  NoWj  in  the  Eighth  Tone 
Toward  the  voice  crying,  etc.   (p.  438). 

C^Then  immediately  recite  the  following  Readings. 

First  Reading :  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah 

These  things,  the  Lord  doth  say:  The  Land  that  was 
desolate  and  impassable  shall  be  glad,  etc.  (p.  438). 


462  Menaion 

Second  Reading :  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah 
(55:1  to  end) 

T^HESE  things  the  Lord  doth  say:  All  that  thirst, 
come  to  the  waters :  and  you  that  have  no  money, 
make  haste,  buy  and  eat:  come  ye,  buy  wine  and  milk 
without  money,  and  without  any  price. 

Why  do  you  spend  money  for  that  which  is  not  bread, 
and  your  labour  for  that  which  doth  not  satisfy  you? 
Hearken  diligently  to  me,  and  eat  that  which  is  good, 
and  your  soul  shall  be  delighted  in  fatness. 

Incline  your  ear  and  come  to  me:  hear  and  your  soul 
shall  live,  and  1  will  make  an  everlasting  covenant  with 
you,  the  faithful  mercies  of  David. 

Behold  I  have  given  him  for  a  witness  to  the  people, 
for  a  leader  and  a  master  to  the  Gentiles. 

Behold  thou  shalt  call  a  nation,  which  thou  knewest 
not:  and  the  nations  that  knew  not  thee  shall  run  to 
thee,  because  of  the  Lord  thy  God,  and  for  the  Holy 
One  of  Israel,  for  he  hath  glorified  thee. 

Seek  ye  the  Lord,  while  he  may  be  found :  call  upon 
him,  while  he  is  near. 

Let  the  wicked  forsake  his  way,  and  the  unjust  man 
his  thoughts,  and  let  him  return  to  the  Lord,  and  he 
will  have  mercy  on  him,  and  to  our  God:  for  he  is 
bountiful  to  forgive. 

For  my  thoughts  are  not  your  thoughts:  nor  your 
ways  my  ways,  saith  the  Lord. 

For  as  the  heavens  are  exalted  above  the  earth,  so  are 
my  ways  exalted  above  your  ways,  and  my  thoughts 
above  your  thoughts. 

And  as  the  rain  and  the  snow  come  down  from 
heaven,  and  return  no  more  thither,  but  soak  the  earth, 
and  water  it,  and  make  it  to  spring,  and  give  seed  to  the 
sower,  and  bread  to  the  eater: 

So  shall  my  word  be,  which  shall  go  forth  from  my 
mouth:  it  shall  not  return  to  me  void,  but  it  shall  do 
whatsoever  I  please,  and  shall  prosper  in  the  things  for 
which  I  sent  it. 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  463 

For  you  shall  go  out  with  joy,  and  be  led  forth  with 
peace:  the  mountains  and  the  hills  shall  sing  praise  be- 
fore you,  and  all  the  trees  of  the  country  shall  clap  their 
hands. 

Instead  of  the  shrub,  shall  come  up  the  fir  tree,  and 
instead  of  the  nettle,  shall  come  up  the  myrtle  tree:  and 
the  Lord  shall  be  named  for  an  everlasting  sign,  that 
shall  not  be  taken  away.

brethren,  that  our  fathers  were  all  under  the  cloud, 

and  all  passed  through  the  sea. 

And  all  in  Moses  were  baptized,  in  the  cloud,  and 

in  the  sea: 

And  did  all  eat  the  same  spiritual  food, 

And  all  drank  the  same  spiritual  drink;   (and  they 

drank  of  the  spiritual  rock  that  followed  them,  and  the 

rock  was  Christ.)

fication  which  belongeth  to  the  Trinity  transcendent  in

That  it  may  be  granted  the  grace  of  redemption  and

That  we  may  be  lighted  by  the  light  of  knowledge 
and  true  worship,  by  the  descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 

That  this  water  may  become  a  gift  for  sanctification, 
redemption  for  sins,  for  the  healing  of  soul  and  body, 
and  for  every  meet  benefit. 

That  this  water  may  be  beneficial  for  eternal  life, 

That  it  may  drive  away  all  the  cunning  devices  of 
our  enemies,  visible  and  invisibe. 

For  those  who  drink  therefrom  and  take  home  for 
the  sanctification  of  their  homes, 

That  it  may  be  for  those  who  drink  and  receive  there- 
from in  faith,  a  purification  for  their  souls  and  bodies. 

That  we  may  be  worthy  to  be  filled  with  sanctifica- 
tion, as  we  receive  of  these  waters,  by  the  appearance 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  in  an  invisible  manner, 

That  the  Lord  answer  the  voice  of  our  beseeching, 
even  of  us  who  are  sinners,  and  have  mercy  upon  us. 

C^The  Deacon  completeth  the  Petitions  of  the  Great  Synapte,  say-

which  are  from  eternity,  and  for  thy  dispensation  of 
salvation  in  these  last  days,  in  which  thou  didst  put  on 
our  weak,  poor  creation,  condescending,  O  King  of  all, 
even  to  become  Man.  And  thou  didst  consent  also  to 
be  baptized  at  the  hand  of  a  servant,  that  by  the  sanc-

divine  mystery,  we  beseech  thee  O  Lover  of  mankind, 
to  sprinkle  us,  thine  unworthy  servants,  according  to 
thy  divine  promise,  with  purifying  water,  and  the  gift 
of  thy  compassion.  May  the  prayers  of  us  sinners  over

thou  mayest  grant  through  it  thy  blessing  to  us  and  to  all

By  Sophronius  the  Jerusalemite  Patriarch 

r^  TRINITY,  transcendent  in  essence,  in  goodness, 
and  in  Divinity,  the  Almighty  who  watcheth  over 
all,  invisible  and  incomprehensible,  O  Creator  of  in- 
telligent essences,  natures  endowed  with  speech,  the 
Goodness  of  utter,  unapproachable  Light,  that  lighteth 
every  man  that  cometh  into  the  world,  lighten  me  also, 
thine  unworthy  servant.  Illuminate  the  eyes  of  my 
mind  that  I  may  venture  to  praise  thy  countless  benevo- 
lences and  thy  might.  Let  my  beseeching  on  behalf 
of  this  people  be  wholy  acceptable,  so  that  my  sins  may 
not  prevent  the  descent  here  of  thy  Holy  Spirit;  that  I 
may  be  allowed  to  cry  to  thee  without  condemnation, 
and  say.  We  glorify  thee,  O  Master,  Lover  of  mankind, 
the  Almighty  King  before  eternity.  We  glorify  thee,  O 
Creator  and  Author  of  all;  we  glorify  thee,  O  only  Son, 
who  art  without  father  on  the  side  of  thy  Mother,  and 
without  mother  on  the  side  of  thy  Father;  for  in  the 
previous  feast  we  beheld  thee  a  babe,  and  in  this  feast 
we  behold  thee  perfect,  O  our  perfect  God,  appearing 
from  the  Perfect;  for  today  we  have  reached  the  time 
of  the  Feast;  and  the  rank  of  saints  gathers  with  us,  and 
the  angels  celebrate  with  men.   Today  the  grace  of  the 


466  Menaion 

Holy  Spirit  hath  descended  on  the  waters  in  the  like- 
ness of  a  dove.  Today  hath  shone  the  Sun  that  setteth 
not,  and  the  world  is  lighted  by  the  light  of  the  Lord. 
Today  the  moon  shineth  with  the  world  in  its  radiating 
beams.  Today  the  shining  stars  adorn  the  universe 
with  the  splendour  of  their  radiance.  Today  the 
clouds  from  heaven  moisten  mankind  with  showers 
of  justice.  Today  the  Uncreate  accepteth  of  his  own 
will  the  laying  on  of  hands  by  his  own  creation. 
Today  the  Prophet  and  Forerunner  draweth  nigh 
to  the  Master,  and  halteth  with  trembling  when  he 
witnesseth  the  condescension  of  God  towards  us. 
Today  the  waters  of  the  Jordan  are  changed  to 
healing  by  the  presence  of  the  Lord.  Today  the  whole 
universe  is  watered  by  mystical  streams.  Today  the 
sins  of  mankind  are  blotted  out  by  the  waters  of  the 
Jordan.  Today  hath  paradise  been  opened  to  mankind, 
and  the  Sun  of  righteousness  hath  shone  for  us.  Today 
the  bitter  water  is  changed  at  the  hands  of  Moses  to 
sweetness  by  the  presence  of  the  Lord.  Today  are  we 
delivered  from  the  ancient  mourning,  and  like  a  new 
Israel  we  have  been  saved.  Today  we  have  escaped 
from  darkness,  and  by  the  light  of  the  knowledge  of 
God  we  have  been  illuminated.  Today  the  darkness 
of  the  world  vanisheth  with  the  appearance  of  our 
God.  Today  the  whole  creation  is  lighted  from  on  high. 
Today  is  error  annulled,  and  the  coming  of  the  Lord 
prepareth  for  us  a  way  of  salvation.  Today  the  celes- 
tials celebrate  with  the  terrestrials,  and  the  terrestrials 
commune  with  the  celestials.  Today  the  assembly  of 
noble  and  great-voiced  Orthodoxy  rejoiceth.  Today 
the  Lord  cometh  to  baptism  to  elevate  mankind  above. 
Today  the  Unbowable  boweth  to  his  servant  to  deliver 
us  from  slavery.  Today  we  have  bought  the  kingdom 
of  heaven,  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven  hath  no  end. 

Today  the  land  and  the  sea  have  divided  between 
them  the  joy  of  the  world,  and  the  w^orld  hath  been 
filled  with  rejoicing.  The  waters  saw  thee,  O  God.  the 
waters  saw  thee ;  they  were  afraid,   Jordan  turned  back 


January  6 — The  Epiphany  467 

when  it  beheld  the  fire  of  the  Godhead  coming  down 
and  descending  upon  it  in  the  flesh.  Jordan  turned 
back  at  beholding  the  Holy  Spirit  descending  in  the 
likeness  of  a  dove  and  hovering  over  thee.  Jordan 
turned  back  when  it  saw  the  Invisible  visible,  the  Crea- 
tor incarnate,  and  the  Master  in  the  likeness  of  a  serv- 
ant. Jordan  turned  back  and  the  mountains  shouted 
with  joy  at  beholding  God  in  the  flesh.  And  the  clouds 
gave  voice,  wondering  at  him  that  cometh,  who  is  Light 
of  Li8:ht,  true  God  of  true  God,  drowning  in  the  Jor- 
dan the  death  of  sin,  the  thorn  of  error,  and  bond  of 
hades,  granting  the  world  the  baptism  of  salvation. 
So  also  I,  thine  unworthy  sinning  servant,  as  I  proclaim 
thy  great  wonders,  am  encompassed  by  fear,  crying 
reverently  unto  thee,  and  saying, 

^And  at  once  he  saith  in  a  louder  voice:

thy  wonders  {three  times)  ;  for  by  thy  will  thou  didst 
bring  out  all  things  from  nonexistence  to  existence;  and 
by  thy  might  thou  dost  control  creation,  and  by  thy 
providence  thou  dost  govern  the  world.  Thou  it  is 
who  didst  organize  creation  from  four  elements,  and 
crowned  the  cycle  of  the  year  with  four  seasons.  Before 
thee  tremble  supersensual  powers;  thee  the  sun  prais- 
eth,  the  moon  worshippeth,  the  stars  submit  to  thee,  the 
light  obeyeth,  the  tempests  tremble,  the  springs  wor- 
ship thee.  Thou  didst  spread  out  the  heaven  like  a 
tent;  thou  didst  establish  the  earth  on  the  waters.  Thou 
didst  surround  the  sea  with  sand.  Thou  didst  pour  out 
the  air  for  breathing.  Thee  do  the  angelic  hosts  serve; 
thee  the  ranks  of  the  archangels  do  worship,  the  many- 
eyed  cherubim,  the  six-winged  seranhim,  as  they  stand 
in  thy  presence  and  fly  about  thee,  hiding:  with  fear  from 
thine  unapproachable  glory;  for  whih^  remaining:  a 
boundless  God,  be^inninjrless  and  inefTable,  thou  didst 
come  to  earth,  taking  the  likeness  of  a  servant,  and  be- 
came like  men.    By  the  feeling  of  thy  compassion,  O 


468  Menaion 

Master,  thou  couldest  not  bear  to  see  mankind  defeated 
by  Satan,  but  didst  come  and  save  us;  for  to  thee  do  we 
attribute  grace,  and  preach  mercy,  and  conceal  not 
benevolence.  The  sons  of  our  nature  thou  didst  free; 
the  virginal  womb  by  thy  Nativity  thou  didst  sanctify. 
Therefore,  all  creation  hath  praised  thee  in  thine  ap- 
pearance; for  thou  our  God  didst  appear  on  earth,  and 
among  men  thou  didst  walk.  The  courses  of  the  Jor- 
dan thou  didst  sanctify,  having  sent  unto  it  from  heaven 
thine  all-holy  Spirit,  and  didst  crush  the  heads  of  the 
dragons  nestling  therein.  Wherefore,  thou  King  and 
Lover  of  mankind,  be  present  now  by  the  descent  of 
thy  Holy  Spirit  and  sanctify  this  water  (three  times). 
And  grant  it  the  grace  of  redemption  and  the  blessing 
of  the  Jordan.  Make  it  a  fount  of  incorruptibility,  a 
gift  for  sanctification,  a  redemption  for  sins,  an  elixir 
for  maladies,  a  destroyer  of  Satans,  unapproachable  by 
the  adversary  powers  and  full  of  angelic  powers;  so 
that  to  all  who  drink  therefrom  and  receive  thereof  it 
may  be  for  the  sanctification  of  their  souls  and  bodies, 
for  the  healing  of  sufferings,  for  the  sanctification  of 
homes,  and  for  every  befitting  benefit;  for  thou  art  our 
God  who  with  water  and  the  Spirit  renewed  our  nature 
made  old  by  sin.  Thou  art  our  God  who  didst  drown 
sin  in  the  water  at  the  time  of  Noah.  Thou  art  our  God 
who  in  the  sea  deliveredst  the  Hebrews  from  the  bond- 
age of  Pharoah  at  the  hands  of  Moses.  Thou  art  our 
God  who  didst  cleave  the  rock  in  the  wilderness,  so 
that  the  waters  gushed  out  and  the  valleys  overflowed, 
thus  satisfying  thy  thirsty  people.  Thou  art  our  God 
who  with  fire  and  water  deliveredst  Israel  from  the 
error  of  Baal  at  the  hands  of  Elisha.  Wherefore,  O 
Master,  sanctify  this  water  by  thy  Holy  Spirit  (three 
times).  Grant  to  all  who  touch  it  and  who  are  anointed 
by  it  and  who  receive  thereof,  sanctification,  blessing, 
cleansing,  and  health.  Save,  O  Lord,  thy  servants,  our 
believing  kings  (three  times).  Keep  them  under  thy 
shadow  in  peace.  Subdue  under  their  feet  every  enemy 
and  adversary.    Grant  to  them  the  means  of  salvation,

Priest.    Bow  your  heads  unto  the  Lord. 

Choir.  To  thee,  O  Lord. 

C^And  the  Priest  saith  the  following  Prayer  privately. 

TNCLINE  thine  ear,  O  Lord,  and  hear  us.  O  thou 
who  didst  sanctify  water  when  thou  didst  consent  to 
be  baptized  in  the  Jordan,  bless  us  all,  who  by  the  bow- 
ing of  our  heads  have  signified  our  bondage,  and  make 
us  worthy  to  be  filled  with  thy  sanctification,  by  the 
receiving  of  this  water  and  its  sprinkling.  Let  it  be  to 
us,  O  Lord,  for  health  of  soul  and  body. 

C^nd  this  Proclamation. 

T^OR  thou  art  the  sanctification  of  our  souls  and 
^  bodies,  and  to  thee  we  address  glory,  thanks,  and 
worship,  with  the  Father  who  hath  no  beginning  and 
the  all-holy  Spirit,  the  God  and  Author  of  life,  now 
and  for  ever  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

a^And  then  immediately  the  Priest  blesseth  the  water  in  the  form  of 
a  cross,  and  immerseth  the  precious  cross  up  and  down,  holding  it 
straight,  as  he  singeth  the  following  Troparion  {three  times),  in 
the  First  Tone. 

T)  Y  thy  baptism,  O  Lord,  in  the  River  Jordan,  wor-

Wherefore,  O  thou  who  didst  appear  and  lighted  the

singeth  the  following  Idiomelon,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 

T  ET  us  praise,  O  believers,  the  great  dispensation  of 
^-^  God,  that  worketh  for  us;  for  he  who  alone  is  pure 
and  spotless,  having  become  Man  because  of  our  fall, 
purifieth  us  in  the  Jordan,  sanctifying  me  and  the  waters 
and  crushing  the  heads  of  the  dragons  in  the  water. 
Let  us,  therefore,  O  brethren,  draw  water  with  glad- 
ness, for  those  who  draw  it  in  faith  shall  be  granted  in 
an  invisible  manner  the  grace  of  the  Spirit,  by  the  pres- 
ence of  Christ  God,  the  Saviour  of  our  souls. 

^Note:  If  the  Feast  falleth  on  a  Sunday  or  a  Monday,  the  Hours  are 
chanted  on  Friday.  But  the  sanctification  of  the  water  taketh  place 
on  the  morning  of  the  Paramon,  after  Mass.  And  Great  Vespers  are 
said  on  Saturday  {if  the  Feast  be  on  a  Sunday),  or  on  a  Sunday 
evening  {if  the  Feast  be  on  a  Monday).  But  the  Liturgy  of  Basil  the 
Great  is  said  on  the  day  of  the  Feast.  At  Great  Vespers,  after  the 
Gospel,  the  order  of  Evening  Prayer  taketh  place  as  usual.  And  in

r\  LORD,  when  thou  didst,  fulfill  what  thou  hadst

from  all  creation  for  thy  mystery;  from  the  angels, 
Gabriel;  from  mankind,  the  Virgin;  from  the  heavens,

thou  didst  blot  out  the  iniquity  of  the  world.  O  our

For  thou  art  the  incarnate  One?  In  the  Name  of  the

The  waters  beheld  thee,  O  God,  the  waters  beheld

First  Kathisma,  in  the  Third  Tone 

r\  CHRIST  Saviour,  by  thine  appearance  in  the 
^^  Jordan,  and  by  thy  baptism  of  the  Forerunner,  it 
was  testified  of  thee  that  thou  art  a  beloved  Son.  Where-

the  Holy  Spirit  descended  upon  thee,  by  whom  being 
lighted  we  cry,  saying.  Glory  to  God  in  three  Persons. 

Second  Kathisma,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

C\  JORDAN  River,  why  wast  thou  astonished  at 
beholding  the  Invisible  naked?  And  he  answereth, 
saying,  I  beheld  him  and  trembled;  for  how  shall  I 
not  tremble  and  fear,  when  the  angels  trembled  at  sight 
of  him,  heaven  was  astounded,  earth  was  encompassed 
by  trepidation,  and  the  sea  was  bashful,  with  all  things 
visible  and  invisible;  for  Christ  hath  appeared  in  the 
Jordan  to  bless  the  waters.

Right  Choir.  1.  The  Lord  mighty  in  wars  uncovered 
the  bottom  of  the  sea,  and  drew  his  own  to  dry  land ; 
and  with  it  he  submerged  his  adversaries;  for  he  hath 
been  glorified. 

Left  Choir.  Another.  Verily,  Israel  passed  the  temp- 
est of  the  tumultuous  sea,  having  appeared  to  him  again 
as  dry  land.  But  the  tri-speared  Egyptians  were  lost 
wholly  by  the  darkness  of  the  deep,  as  a  graveyard 
swept  by  waters,  by  the  power  of  the  precious  right 
hand  of  the  Master.

our  kings,  and  who  raiseth  those  born  of  his  anointed 
ones,  was  born  of  the  Virgin,  and  cometh  to  baptism.

wide  our  mouths,  inditing  to  the  Word  sayings  of  praise 
for  his  benefactions  granted  to  us;  for  he  is  pleased 
thereby. 

Left  Choir.  He  of  whom  thou  didst  say,  O  Lord, 
that  he  is  a  voice  crying  in  the  wilderness,  heard  thy 
voice  when  thou  didst  thunder  on  the  many  waters, 
testifying  to  thy  Son.  And  having  been  filled  wholly 
by  the  presence  of  the  Spirit,  he  shouted,  saying.  Thou 
art  Christ,  the  Wisdom  of  God  and  his  Power. 

Right  Choir.  Another.  The  Prophet  having  been 
cleansed  by  the  fire  of  mystical  vision,  praising  the  re- 
newal of  mankind,  sang  with  a  great  voice,  moved  by 
the  Spirit,  revealing  the  ineflfable  Incarnation,  the 
Incarnation  of  the  Word,  by  which  the  might  of  the 
mighty  hath  been  crushed. 

Right  Choir.  5.  Verily  Jesus,  the  Originator  of  life, 
cometh  to  unravel  the  fall  of  Adam,  the  first  of  crea- 
tion; and  he  who  needeth  not  purification,  since  he  is 
God,  granteth  to  the  fallen  one  purification  in  the  Jor- 
dan. And  as  he  abolisheth  in  him  the  enmity,  he 
thereby  granteth  safety  transcending  all  intelligence.

by  the  purification  of  the  Spirit  from  the  dark,  mire- 
defiled  venom  of  the  enemy,  have  come  upon  a  new 
way,  not  misleading,  but  leading  to  a  bliss  unapproach- 
able except  by  those  who  have  been  reconciled  to  God. 

Right  Choir.  6.  Verily  the  voice  of  the  Word,  the 
lamp  of  the  Light,  the  mystical  star  and  Forerunner  of 
the  Sun,  doth  cry  out  in  the  wilderness,  saying  to  all  the 
people.  Repent  and  be  purified;  for  Christ  hath  come 
to  deliver  the  world  from  corruption. 

Left  Choir.  Another.  Him  whom  the  Father  had 
caused  to  overflow  from  the  belly,  in  his  all-blissful 
voice  he  proclaimed  beloved,  saying.  Yea,  this  is  my 
Son  consubstantial  with  me;  the  Radiance  of  my  light 
hath  been  born  of  mankind.     And  he  himself  is  my

living  Word  and  Man  at  the  same  time,  for  his  own

Right  Choir.  7.  The  youths  of  true  worship  when 
they  were  cast  in  the  furnace  of  fire,  were  kept  from 
harm  by  the  gentle  dewy  breeze  and  by  the  descent  of 
the  divine  angel.  Wherefore,  when  they  were  moist- 
ened by  the  flames,  they  sang  with  gratitude,  shouting, 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord,  transcending  praise,  the  God 
of  our  fathers. 

Left  Choir.  Another.  Verily,  he  who  quenched  the 
flaming  fire  of  the  furnace  containing  the  youths  of 
true  worship,  hath  burned  the  heads  of  dragons  in  the 
courses  of  water;  and  by  the  dew  of  the  Spirit  hath 
cleansed  the  abysmal  darkness  resulting  from  sin. 

Let  us  praise,  bless,  and  worship  the  Lord. 

Left  Choir.  8.  Verily,  the  furnace  of  Babylon  re- 
vealed a  strange  secret  when  it  overflowed  with  dew. 
But  Jordan  was  about  to  receive  in  its  courses  the  im- 
material Fire,  and  was  to  contain  the  Creator  baptized 
in  the  flesh,  whom  the  nations  bless  and  exalt  yet  more 
unto  the  end  of  ages. 

Right  Choir.  Another.  The  prince  of  darkness  sigh- 
eth  to  himself  because  creation  hath  been  freed,  and 
those  who  were  of  old  in  darkness  have  become  sons 
of  the  Light.  Wherefore,  all  the  nations  of  the  Gen- 
tiles that  before  had  been  wretched,  now  ceaselessly 
bless  Christ  the  Cause.

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  her  who  is  more  honourable, 
and  more  exalted  than  the  heavenly  hosts. 

Right  Choir.  9.  Verily,  all  tongues  are  at  a  loss  to 
praise  thee  properly;  and  every  mind,  even  though 
transcending  the  world,  is  distracted  in  thy  praise,  O 
Theotokos.  But  because  thou  art  good,  accept  our 
faith,  having  known  our  divine  longing.     Wherefore, 


476  Menaion 

since  thou  art  the  aider  of  Christians,  we  do  magnify 
thee. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  came  to  be  baptized 
in  the  Jordan. 

Come,  O  David,  in  the  spirit,  and  sing,  saying  to 
those  who  seek  the  light,  Come  ye  now  to  God  in  faith, 
and  shine.  This  poor  man  Adam  cried  when  he  fell, 
and  the  Lord  heard  him,  coming  to  the  courses  of  the 
Jordan  and  renewing  him  who  had  been  overtaken  by 
corruption. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  who  received  baptism  from 
the  Forerunner. 

Verily,  Isaiah  crieth,  saying.  Wash  ye,  make  ye  clean; 
put  away  the  evil  of  your  doings  from  before  the  eyes 
of  the  Lord;  and  ye  that  thirst  come  to  the  living  water; 
for  Christ  overfloweth  with  renovating  water  for  those 
who  hasten  to  him  in  faith.  He  baptizeth  them  with 
the  Spirit  to  immortal  life. 

Magnify,  O  my  soul,  him  of  whom  the  fatherly  voice 
testified. 

Let  us  be  preserved,  O  believers,  in  grace  and  by  the 
seal;  for,  as  the  Jews  escaped  of  old  from  destruction 
by  smearing  their  thresholds  with  blood,  thus  shall  this 
divine  cleansing  be  for  us  the  cleansing  of  rebirth,  a 
way  wherein  we  shall  see  the  never-setting  light  of  the 
Trinity. 

The  Ninth  Ode  of  the  Other  Canon 

Today  the  Master  bendeth  his  neck  to  the  hand  of 
the  Forerunner. 

O  the  wonder  of  thy  superintelligent  Nativity,  thou 
all-pure  bride,  the  blessed  Mother  to  whom  having 
received  therefrom  perfect  salvation,  we  indite  a  fitting 
song,  offering  as  a  gift  the  song  of  gratitude. 

Glory:  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  might  of  the  three- 
personed  and  indivisible  Trinity. 

Having  known  the  outward  things  which  appeared 
to  Moses  in  the  bush,  let  us  come  and  behold  the  won-

ders  taking  place  with  strange  signs;  for  as  that  was 
perserved,  so  the  Virgin  was  preserved  when  she  con- 
ceived Fire,  giving  birth  to  the  light-bearing  Benefac- 
tor. And  so  was  it  with  the  courses  of  the  Jordan  when 
they  received  him. 

Now:  Magnify,  O  my  soul,  the  Maiden  who  deliv- 
ered us  from  the  curse. 

O  eternal  King,  when  thou  didst  cleanse  the  sub- 
stance of  mankind  in  pure  streams,  and  anointed  it, 
perfecting  it  by  the  communion  of  the  Spirit,  and  be- 
traying the  power  of  darkness  that  had  possessed  it, 
thou  didst  translate  it  to  life  immortal. 

C^Then  conclude  with  the  tivo  Katabasias  with  their  Magnifications,

hath  appeared  in  the  courses  of  the  Jordan  and 
lighted  those  who  lie  in  darkness  and  the  shadow  of

hath  appeared.

By  Patriarch  Germanus 

/^^HRIST  our  God  who  is  Light  of  Light,  God  man- 
^^  ifest,  hath  shone  forth  to  the  world.  Let  us,  O 
nations,  worship  him.    {Repeat.) 

How  shall  we  servants  fittingly  honour  thee,  O  Christ 
Master;  for  by  water  thou  didst  renew  us  all. 

When  thou  wast  baptized  in  the  Jordan,  O  our  Sav- 
iour, thou  didst  sanctify  the  courses  by  the  laying  of 
thy  servant's  hand  upon  thee,  healing  the  sufferings  of 
the  world.  Wherefore,  great  is  the  mystery  of  thy 
dispensation,  O  Lord,  Lover  of  mankind,  glory  to  thee. 

The  true  Lieht  hath  appeared,  granting  illumination 
to  all.  And  Christ  transcending  all  purity  is  baptized 
with  us,  charging  the  water  with  sanctity  for  the  puri-

fication  of  souls.  Verily,  the  thing  apparent  is  earthly, 
but  its  significance  transcendeth  the  heavens;  for  by 
washing  salvation  is  attained,  by  water  the  Spirit,  and 
by  immersion  ascent  to  God.  Wherefore,  great  are 
thy  works,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

He  that  encompasseth  the  heavens  with  clouds  put- 
teth  on  today  tha  courses  of  the  Jordan;  and  he  that 
lifteth  the  sin  of  the  world,  cleanseth  and  purifieth  mc. 
Yea,  the  Spirit  hath  testified  of  him  from  on  high  that 
he  is  the  only  Son  of  the  Father  on  high.  Let  us,  there- 
fore, shout  to  him,  crying,  O  thou  who  didst  appear 
and  save  us.    Glory  to  thee.

Today  John  toucheth  the  head  of  the  Master.  The 
powers  of  heaven  were  astonished  at  beholding  the 
strange  mystery.  The  sea  saw  and  fled;  Jordan,  be-

But  John  stayed  him,  saying:  I  ought  to  be  baptized 
by  thee,  and  comest  thou  to  me? 

And  Tesus  answering,  said  to  him:  Sufifer  it  to  be  so 
now.  For  so  it  becometh  us  to  fulfill  all  justice.  Then 
he  sufifered  him. 

And  Jesus  being  baptized,  forthwith  came  out  of  the 
water:  and  lo,  the  heavens  were  opened  to  him:  and  he 
saw  the  Spirit  of  God  descending  as  a  dove,  and  com-

4^0 n  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  chant  three  for  Vespers  of  the 
Epiphany,  and  the  following  three  Prosomia,  in  the  First  Tone. 

Q  ALL-EXTOLLED  Forerunner  of  Christ,  O 
God-inspired  Baptizer,  as  we  beatify  thee  in  true 
worship,  we  glorify  Christ  who  bowed  his  head  to  thee 
in  the  Jordan,  sanctifying  the  nature  of  man.  Where- 
fore, him  do  thou  implore  to  grant  to  our  souls  safety 
and  the  Great  Mercy. 

Thou  hast  come  before  and  beheld,  O  John,  the  wise 
Forerunner,  the  ineffable  glory  of  the  Father  from  on 
high,  and  the  Son  in  the  waters.  And  thou  didst  see 
the  Spirit  descending  on  him  in  the  likeness  of  a  dove, 
purifying  and  lighting  the  ends  of  the  earth.  Where- 
fore, as  we  proclaim  thee  a  heavenly  initiate  of  the 
Trinity,  we  honour  thy  divine  Feast. 

When  thou  wast  confirmed,  O  Forerunner  and  Bap- 
tizer, by  the  divine  grace  of  Christ,  thou  didst  show  us 
the  Lamb  that  taketh  away  all  the  sins  of  the  world, 
joining  to  him  gladly  two  Disciples.  Wherefore,  im- 
plore thou  him  to  grant  our  souls  safety  and  the  Great 
Mercy.

VX7HEN  John  the  Forerunner  saw  thee  advancing 
toward  him,  O  Master,  he  was  overtaken  by  sur- 
prise, and  shouted  as  a  grateful  servant,  saying,  What 
is  this  condescension,  O  Saviour,  and  what  is  this  humil- 
ity with  which  thou  hast  encompassed  thyself,  O  thou 
who  by  the  richness  of  thy  goodness  didst  raise  humble 
man,  by  putting  him  on;  for  thou  art  compassionate? 

Stichos:   The  sea  saw  and  fled. 

The  Saviour  of  all  answered  the  Forerunner,  saying, 
Advance  thou  towards  me  and  perform  the  terrible 
mystery  which  I  fulfill  today,  and  fear  not;  for  I  who 
appear  now  in  nature,  am  baptized  like  a  man  in  the 
waters  of  the  Jordan  in  which  thou  seest  me  present. 
But  verily,  I  renew  Adam  bruised  by  sin. 

Stichos:  What  ailed  thee,  O  thou  sea,  that  thou  didst 
flee? 

John  replied,  saying.  Who  of  the  earthly  ones  hath 
ever  seen  the  Sun  being  bathed,  and  he  that  encompass- 
eth  the  heavens  with  clouds  completely  naked,  the  Cre- 
ator of  springs  and  rivers  descending  into  the  waters? 
Verily,  I  am  astonished  at  thine  ineffable  dispensation, 
O  Master.  Tax  not  thou  thy  servant  with  such  terrible 
ceremonies.

CINCE  thou  art  a  lover  of  the  Spirit,  O  Forerunner,

clearly  proclaimed  to  mankind  the  dispensation  of  the 
King  rising  with  shining  splendour  from  the  undefiled 
one  for  the  recall  of  mankind,  putting  away  the  arro- 
gance of  vicious  character,  straightening  the  hearts  of 
those  who  are  baptized  with  repentance,  for  the  recep-

seeing  thee,  stood  in  awe,  and  John  shouted,  saying,  I 
dare  not  take  hold  of  the  deathless  head.  And  the 
Spirit  descended  in  the  likeness  of  a  dove  to  sanctify 
the  waters,  while  a  voice  from  heaven  was  heard  shout- 
ing, This  is  my  Son  that  cometh  into  the  world  to  save 
mankind.    Wherefore,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee.

And  John  gave  testimony,  saying:  I  saw  the  Spirit 
coming  down,  as  a  dove  from  heaven,  and  he  remained 
upon  him. 

And  I  knew  him  not;  but  he  who  sent  me  to  baptize

By  Patriarch  Germanus 

CAY,  O  Simeon,  whom  carriest  thou  in  the  Temple  in 
thine  arms  with  rejoicing?  Towards  whom  dost 
thou  cry,  shouting.  Now  I  have  been  let  to  depart;  for 
I  have  beheld  my  Saviour.  This  is  he  born  of  the 
Virgin.  This  is  the  Word,  God  of  God,  who  was  incar- 
nate for  our  sakes,  and  saved  man.  Him  let  us  wor- 
ship.    (Repeat.) 

Receive,  O  Simeon,  him  whom  Moses  foresaw  on 
Sinai  below  the  clouds  laying  down  the  law,  becoming 
a  child,  and  obeying  the  law.  He  it  is  who  uttereth  the 
law.  He  it  is  who  was  symbolized  by  the  Prophets,  who 
hath  become  incarnate  for  our  sakes  and  saved  man. 
Him  let  us  worship.     (Repeat.) 

Come,  let  us  also  welcome  Christ  and  receive  him 
with  divine  song^s  of  praise,  whose  salvation  Simeon 
saw,  of  whom  David  speaketh.  He  it  is  who  spake 
through  the  Proohets,  who  is  incarnate  for  our  sakes, 
and  speaketh  in  the  law.  Him  let  us  worship.  (Repeat.)

4lThen  the  Eisodos;  and  O  resplendent  Light,  etc;  the  daily  Pro- 
ketmenon;  and  the  folloiuing  Readings. 

First  Reading 

\  ND  the  Lord  spoke  to  Moses,  in  the  same  day  the 
Lord  brought  forth  the  children  of  Israel,  saying: 
Sanctify  unto  me  every  first-born  that  openeth  the 
womb  amongst  the  children  of  Israel. 

And  Moses  went  forth  and  gathered  all  the  people 
and  said  to  them:  Remember  this  day  in  which  you 
came  forth  out  of  Egypt,  and  out  of  the  house  of  bond- 
age, for  with  a  strong  hand  hath  the  Lord  brought  you 
forth  out  of  this  place.  Thou  shalt  keep  this  observ- 
ance. 

And  when  the  Lord  shall  have  brought  thee  into  the 
land  of  the  Chanaanite,  as  he  swore  to  thee  and  thy 
fathers,  thou  shalt  set  apart  all  that  openeth  the  womb 
of  the  male  sex  for  the  Lord.  And  when  thy  son  shall 
ask  thee  tomorrow,  saying:  What  is  this?  Thou  shalt 
answer  him:  With  a  strong  hand  did  the  Lord  bring 
us  forth  out  of  the  land  of  Egypt,  out  of  the  house  of 
bondage.  For  when  Pharao  was  hardened,  and  would 
not  let  us  go,  the  Lord  slew  every  first-born  in  the  land 
of  Egypt,  from  the  first-born  of  man  to  the  first-born  of 
beasts :  therefore,  I  sacrifice  to  the  Lord  all  that  openeth 
the  womb  of  the  male  sex,  and  all  the  first-born  of  my 
sons  I  redeem. 

And  it  shall  be  as  a  sign  in  thy  hand,  and  as  a  thing 
hung  between  thy  eyes. 

For  in  this  wise  saith  the  Lord  Almighty:  Thou 
shalt  give  me  the  first-born  of  thy  sons,  and  every  infant 
male  born  to  thee  shall  be  circumcised  on  the  eighth 
day. 


February  2 — Presentation  of  Our  Lord        497 

She  shall  remain  three  and  thirty  days  and  shall 
touch  no  holy  thing,  neither  shall  she  enter  into  the 
sanctuary,  until  the  days  of  her  purification  be  fulfilled. 

And  when  the  days  of  her  purification  are  expired, 
she  shall  bring  to  the  door  of  the  tabernacle  of  the  testi- 
mony, a  lamb  of  a  year  old  for  a  holocaust,  and  a  young 
pigeon  or  a  turtle  dove  for  sin,  and  shall  deliver  them 
to  the  priest  or  instead  of  this,  she  shall  bring  to  the 
Lord,  a  pair  of  turtle  doves,  or  pair  of  young  pigeons. 
And  the  priest  shall  pray  for,  her,  and  so  she  shall  be 
cleansed.  For  as  a  gift  they  were  given  me  by  the 
children  of  Israel. 

I  have  taken  them  instead  of  the  first-born  that  open 
every  womb  in  Israel. 

For  all  the  first-born  of  the  children  of  Israel,  both 
of  men  and  of  beasts,  are  mine.  From  the  day  that  I 
slew  every  first-born  in  the  land  of  Egypt,  have  I  sanc- 
tified them  to  myself. 

Second  Reading :  from  Isaiah  (6:1-12) 

TN  the  year  that  king  Oxias  died,  I  saw  the  Lord  sit- 
ting upon  a  throne  high  and  elevated:  and  his  train 

filled  the  temple. 

Upon  it  stood  the  seraphims:  the  one  had  six  wings, 

and  the  other  had  six  wings :  with  two  they  covered  his 

face,  and  with  two  they  covered  his  feet,  and  with  two 

they  flew. 

And  they  cried  one  to  another,  and  said:  Holy,  holy, 

holy,  the  Lord  God  of  hosts,  all  the  earth  is  full  of  his 

glory. 

And  the  lintels  of  the  doors  were  moved  at  the  voice 

of  him  that  cried,  and  the  house  was  filled  with  smoke. 
And  I  said:  Woe  is  me,  because  I  have  held  my 

peace;  because  I  am  a  man  of  unclean  lips,  and  I  dwell 

in  the  midst  of  a  people  that  hath  unclean  lips,  and  I 

have  seen  with  my  eyes  the  King  the  Lord  of  hosts. 
And  one  of  the  seraphims  flew  to  me,  and  in  his  hand 

was  a  live  coal,  which  he  had  taken  with  the  tongs  off 

the  altar,

And  he  touched  my  mouth,  and  said :  Behold  this 
hath  touched  thy  lips,  and  thy  iniquities  shall  be  taken 
away,  and  thy  sin  shall  be  cleansed. 

And  I  heard  the  voice  of  the  Lord,  saying:  Whom 
shall  I  send?  and  who  shall  go  for  us?  And  I  said  :  Lo, 
here  am  I,  send  me. 

And  he  said:  Go,  and  thou  shalt  say  to  this  people: 
Hearing,  hear,  and  understand  not:  and  see  the  vision, 
and  know  it  not. 

Blind  the  heart  of  this  people,  and  make  their  ears 
heavy,  and  shut  their  eyes:  lest  they  see  with  their  eyes, 
and  hear  with  their  ears,  and  understand  with  their 
heart,  and  be  converted  and  I  heal  them. 

And  I  said :  How  long,  O  Lord?  And  he  said  :  Until 
the  cities  be  wasted  without  inhabitant,  and  the  houses 
without  man,  and  the  land  shall  be  left  desolate. 

And  the  Lord  shall  remove  men  far  away,  and  she 
shall  be  multiplied  that  was  left  in  the  midst  of  the 
earth. 

Third  Reading :  from  Isaiah 

OEHOLD  the  Lord  will  ascend  upon  a  swift  cloud, 
^■^and  will  enter  into  Egypt,  and  the  idols  of  Egypt 
shall  be  moved  at  his  presence,  and  the  heart  of  Egypt 
shall  melt  in  the  midst  thereof. 

And  the  spirit  of  Egypt  shall  be  broken  in  the  bowels 
thereof,  and  I  will  cast  down  their  counsel. 

And  I  will  deliver  Egypt  into  the  hand  of  cruel  mas- 
ters, and  a  strong  king  shall  rule  over  them,  saith  the 
Lord  the  God  of  hosts. 

The  Egyptians  shall  drink  water  from  the  shore  of 
the  sea,  and  the  river  shall  be  wasted  and  dry. 

Where  are  now  thy  wise  men?  Let  them  tell  thee, 
and  show  what  the  Lord  of  hosts  hath  purposed  upon 
Egypt. 

In  that  day  Egypt  shall  be  like  unto  women,  and  they 
shall  be  amazed,  and  afraid,  because  of  the  moving  of 
the  hand  of  the  Lord  of  hosts,  which  he  shall  move 
over  it.

In  that  day  there  shall  be  an  altar  of  the  Lord  in  the 
midst  of  the  land  of  Egypt,  and  a  monument  of  the 
Lord  at  the  borders  thereof; 

It  shall  be  for  a  sign,  and  for  a  testimony  to  the  Lord 
of  hosts  in  the  land  of  Egypt.  For  they  shall  cry  to 
the  Lord  because  of  the  oppressor,  and  he  shall  send 
them  a  Saviour  and  a  defender  to  deliver  them. 

And  the  Lord  shall  be  known  by  Egypt,  and  the 
Egyptians  shall  know  the  Lord  in  that  day,  and  shall 
worship  him  with  sacrifices  and  offerings:  and  they 
shall  make  vow^s  to  the  Lord,  and  perform  them.

CEARCH  the  books,  as  Christ  our  God  said  in  the 
Gospels;  for  there  we  shall  see  him  born  and 
wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes,  a  suckling  babe  feed- 
ing on  milk;  accepting  circumcision,  borne  in  the  arms 
of  Simeon,  and  appearing  to  the  world,  not  in  fancy 
or  imagination,  but  in  truth.  Wherefore,  let  us  shout 
to  him,  saying,  O  God  before  eternity,  glory  to  thee.

By  Cosmos  the  Anchorite 

A  DORN  thy  chamber,  O  Zion,  and  receive  Christ 
the  King.  Welcome  Mary  the  heavenly  gate;  for 
she  hath  appeared  as  a  cherubic  throne;  she  carrieth  the 
King  of  glory.  Verily,  the  Virgin  is  a  cloud  of  light 
carrying  in  her  body  the  Son  who  is  before  the  morning 
star,  whom  Simeon  carrying  in  his  arms,  proclaimed  to 
the  nations  as  the  Lord  of  life  and  death,  and  the  Sav- 
iour of  our  souls. 

Stichos :  Now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart,  O  Lord, 
in  peace. 


500  Menaion 

He  that  riseth  from  the  Father  before  eternity,  and 
in  these  last  days  from  a  Virgin's  womb,  hath  been  car- 
ried to  the  Temple  by  his  spouseless  Mother;  and  him 
who  laid  down  the  law  in  the  Mount  of  Sinai,  she  of- 
fereth  to  the  righteous  old  priest,  to  whom  it  was  re- 
vealed that  he  should  behold  the  Lord  Christ  obeying 
the  ceremonies  of  the  law.  And  when  Simeon  received 
him  in  his  arms,  he  rejoiced,  crying.  This  is  God  co- 
eternal  with  the  Father,  and  the  Deliverer  of  our  souls. 

Stichos:   A  light  to  the  revelation  of  the  Gentiles. 

Him  that  rideth  in  the  chariots  of  the  cherubim,  and 
is  praised  with  the  songs  of  the  seraphim,  the  Theotokos 
carried  in  her  arms,  incarnate  of  her  who  knew  no 
spouse.  And  she  delivered  him  who  gave  the  law,  ful- 
filling the  order  of  the  law,  into  the  hands  of  the  old 
priest,  who,  having  carried  Life  sought  deliverance 
from  life,  sayinp,  No^v  lettest  thou  me  depart,  O  Mas- 
ter, that  I  may  tell  Adam  that  I  beheld  as  babe  the 
immutable  God,  who  is  before  eternity,  and  the  Saviour 
of  the  world. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Eighth  Tone  (By  Andrew 
the  Cretan) 

T-TE  that  rideth  on  the  cherubim,  who  is  praised  by 
the  seraphim,  today  is  offered  acording  to  the  law 
in  the  divine  Temple,  lying  in  the  arms  of  an  old  man, 
and  receives  from  Joseph  offerings  becoming  God,  two 
pairs  of  turtle  doves,  the  undefiled  Church  and  the  peo- 
ple chosen  anew  from  the  Gentiles,  and  two  pairs  of 
pigeons,  since  he  is  the  Head  of  the  Old  and  New 
Covenants.  But  Simeon,  having  received  the  meaning 
of  revelation  which  was  made  unto  him,  blessed  the 
Virgin  Mary,  the  Theotokos,  foretelling  and  pointing 
to  the  sufferings  of  him  who  was  born  of  her,  seeking 
deliverance  from  him  and  crying,  Now  letest  thou  me 
depart,  O  Master,  as  thou  wentest  before  and  promisedst 
me;  for  I  have  beheld  thee,  O  Light  before  eternity, 
the  Lord  and  Saviour  of  the  Christian  people.

The  Troparion,  in  the  First  Tone  (three  times) 

Ty  EJOICE,  O  virgin  Theotokos,  full  of  grace;  for 
^^  from  thee  arose  the  Sun  of  justice,  Christ  our  God, 
lighting  those  who  are  in  darkness.  Rejoice  and  be 
glad,  O  righteous  old  man,  carrying  in  thine  arms  the 
Deliverer  of  our  souls,  who  granteth  us  resurrection. 

2.   Matins 

i^Jfter  God  the  Lord  hath  appeared  unto  us,  the  Troparion  {three 
times);  and  the  following  Kathismata. 

First  Kathisma,  in  the  First  Tone 
T  ET  the  ranks  of  angels  be  astonished  with  wonder, 
^^  and  let  us  men  raise  our  voices  in  praise,  as  we 
behold  the  ineffable  condescension,  the  condescension  of 
God;  for  he  before  whom  the  powers  of  heaven  trem- 
ble is  carried  today  in  the  arms  of  an  old  man,  and  he 
alone  is  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Second  Kathisma,  in  the  First  Tone 

T-TE  that  is  with  the  Father  on  the  holy  throne,  came 
down  to  earth,  was  born  of  the  Virgin,  becoming 
a  babe,  is  unbounded  in  time,  and  Simeon,  having  car- 
ried him  in  his  arms,  shouted  with  joy,  saying.  Now 
lettest  thou  thy  servant,  O  compassionate  One,  depart; 
for  thou  hast  gladdened  him. 

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

^X/'ERILY,  the  Ancient  of  Days  becometh  a  babe  for 
my  sake;  and  the  all-pure  God  shareth  in  the  im- 
pure to  save  me  in  the  flesh  which  he  took  from  the 
Virgin.  And  Simeon,  having  been  made  confidant  to 
these  mysteries,  knew  him  as  God  appearing  in  the 
flesh.  Wherefore,  he  kissed  him;  for  he  is  Life;  and 
the  old  man  cried  with  joy  saying,  Lettest  thou  me  de- 
part; for  I  have  beheld  thee,  O  Life  of  all. 

^Then  the  Anabathmoi,  From  my  youth,  etc.  {p.  50) ;  and  the  fol- 
lowing Prokeimenon. 


502  Menalon 

I  shall  proclaim  thy  Name  from  generation  to  gene- 
ration.    My  heart  overfloweth  with  a  good  word. 

The  Matin  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (2:25-32) 

TN  those  days:  There  was  a  man  in  Jerusalem  named 
Simeon,  and  this  man  was  just  and  devout,  waiting 
for  the  consolation  of  Israel;  and  the  Holy  Spirit  was 
in  him. 

And  he  had  received  an  answer  from  the  Holy  Spirit, 
that  he  should  not  see  death,  before  he  had  seen  the 
Christ  of  the  Lord. 

And  he  came  by  the  Spirit  into  the  Temple.  And 
when  his  parents  brought  in  the  child  Jesus,  to  do  for 
him  according  to  the  custom  of  the  law, 

He  also  took  him  into  his  arms,  and  blessed  God,  and 
said: 

Now  thou  dost  dismiss  thy  servant,  O  Lord,  accord- 
ing to  thy  word  in  peace : 

Because  my  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation, 

Which  thou  hast  prepared  before  the  face  of  all 
peoples : 

A  light  to  the  revelation  of  the  Gentiles,  and  the 
glory  of  thy  people  Israel. 

i[Then  Psalm  50  {plain  reading) ;  Glory,  By  the  intercessions  of  the 
Theotokos,  etc.;  Now  {repeat);  then,  O  merciful  One,  have  mercy 
upon  me,  O  God,  etc.;  and  the  Idiomelon,  in  the  Sixth  Tone,  Today 
let  the  gate  of  heaven  be  opened,  etc.    {p.  495). 

Katabasias  of  the  Presentation,  in  the  Third  Tone 
By  Cosmos  the  Anchorite^ 

1.  The  sun  of  old  passed  over  the  depth  of  the  temp- 
est begetting  dry  land;  for  the  water  dried  up  on  both 
sides  like  a  wall  for  the  people  to  pass  through  its  depth, 
singing  songs  well  pleasing  to  God,  and  shouting,  Let 
us  praise  the  Lord;  for  by  glory  he  hath  been  glorified. 

1  These  Katabasias  of  the  Feast  of  the  Presentation  are  sung  from  January 
first  to  February  ninth. 


February  2 — Presentation  of  Our  Lord        503 

3.  O  Lord,  the  Confirmation  of  those  who  put  their 
trust  in  thee,  confirm  thy  Church  which  thou  hast 
bought  with  thy  precious  blood. 

4.  Thy  virtue,  O  Christ,  hath  covered  the  heavens; 
for  when  the  tabernacle  of  thy  holiness  came,  thy 
Mother,  free  of  corruption,  and  thou  didst  appear  in 
the  Temple  of  thy  glory  borne  in  arms  as  a  babe,  the 
whole  creation  was  filled  with  thy  praise. 

5.  When  Isaiah  saw  God  symbolically  on  a  high 
altar,  surrounded  by  the  angels  of  glory,  he  lifted  his 
voice,  crying.  Woe  is  me,  wretched  man;  for  I  have 
foreseen  God  incarnate,  the  Light  not  apprehended  by 
night,  and  the  Lord  of  peace. 

6.  When  the  old  man  saw  with  his  own  eyes  the 
Salvation  that  was  revealed  to  the  nations,  he  cried  to 
thee,  saying,  O  Christ,  thou  art  my  God,  coming  from 
the  presence  of  God. 

7.  Thee  do  we  praise,  O  Word  of  God,  who  mois- 
tened in  the  fire  the  God-speaking  youths,  and  dwelt  in 
an  incorruptable  Virgin,  singing  in  true  worship, 
Blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  Fathers. 

Let  us  praise,  bless,  and  worship  the  Lord. 

8.  The  youths  striving  for  true  worship,  standing  in 
the  midst  of  unbearable  fire  and  not  hurt  at  all  by  the 
flames,  sang  a  song  of  divine  praise,  saying,  Bless  the 
Lord,  all  his  works,  exalt  him  still  more  to  the  end  of 
ages. 

C^Then  sing  the  following  Magnifications. 

r\  VIRGIN  Mother  Thou, 
^^  The  Mystery  fulfilling 
Transcending  human  minds, 
With  heavenly  hosts  attending. 

Simeon  the  Prophet  held 
UDon  his  arms  the  God, 
The  Law  Creator  who 
.    Reigneth  in  heaven,  the  Lord. 


504  Menaion 


And  having  willed  it  thus 
To  save  man  from  his  fate, 
God  from  a  Virgin's  womb, 
Came  sharing  our  state. 

Thy  praise,  O  Virgin  pure, 
Floweth  on  every  tongue ; 
For  thy  first-born  the  Christ, 
Thou  art  extolled  by  song. 

Lift  up  your  eyes  to  him, 
Ye  princes  of  all  lands! 
Behold  the  Lord  Christ  borne 
On  Glorious  Simeon's  hands! 

Our  earth  at  the  sight  of  thee 
Doth  shake  for  fear,  O  God. 
Transcending  all  mankind, 
How  can  one  hand  thee  hold? 

Simeon  did  verily  stay, 
Alive  thy  face  to  see; 
Then  cried :  Now  lettest  thou 
My  soul  depart  to  thee! 

The  mystic  ember  held. 
By  tongues  of  old,  It's  said 
Is  Christ  borne  in  the  womb, 
O  precious  first-born  maid. 

By  thy  own  firm,  clear  will 
A  body  thou  didst  take; 
And  on  the  Fortieth  day 
A  visit  to  the  temple  make. 

When  from  his  heaven  above, 
The  Lord  to  earth  did  come; 
Simeon  his  servant  true. 
Rejoicing  did  welcome.

Ninth   Ode 

Be  thou  a  light,  My  God, 
To  my  vision  and  my  mind; 
With  Paeans  that  I  may 
Praise  thee  among  mankind. 

Let  us  magnify,  O  believers,  the  first-born  Son,  the 
eternal  Word  of  the  Father,  First-born  of  a  Mother  who 
knew  no  man;  for  we  have  beheld  in  the  shadow  of  the 
law  and  the  Scriptures  a  sign,  that  every  first-born  male 
that  openeth  the  womb  is  called  holy  to  God. 

To  the  Temple  Mary  came. 
Offering  her  first-born  child, 
Where  glorious  Simeon  stood 
With  open  arms  and  wide. 

Let  us  magnify,  O  believers,  let  us  magnify,  etc. 

My  God  of  thee  I  seek; 
Lettest  thou  me  depart. 
The  Myst'ry  to  me  now  clear, 
I  will  prepare  to  start. 

Of  old  they  offered  a  pair  of  turtle  doves  and  a  pair 
of  pigeons.  But  instead  of  them  the  divine  old  man 
and  Anna  the  pure  prophetess  were  offered  to  him  who 
was  born  of  the  Virgin,  who  was  offered  in  the  Temple, 
who  is  the  Son  of  God.  Wherefore,  they  served  him 
magnifying. 

He  whom  the  angels  serve. 
With  trembling  and  with  fear; 
Lo,  he  is  on  our  earth, 
And  him  doth  Simeon  bear. 

Of  old  they  offered,  etc. 


506  Menaion 

Glory:    O  One  who  didst  appear 
In  Trinity  exalting. 
Keep  them  who  hope  in  thee 
Of  thy  redemption  granting. 

Verily,  Simeon  cried,  saying,  Thou  hast  granted  me, 
O  Christ,  the  delight  of  thy  salvation.  Wherefore,  re- 
ceive thou  thy  servant  lying  in  darkness,  a  divine  pro- 
claimer  and  new  initiate  of  grace,  magnifying  thee  with 
praise. 

Now:     Keep  thou,  Theotokos 

Them  who  thy  succour  seek; 
Preserve  them  from  life's  harms, 
Thy  servants  true  and  meek. 

Verily,  Anna  the  pure  prophetess  and  righteous  old 
woman,  confessed  God  as  is  meet,  thanking  the  Master 
openly  in  the  Temple,  proclaiming  the  Theotokos  and 
magnifying  her  before  all  present. 

^Tlien  repeat  the  Herjnos  of  the  Ninth   Ode,  Let  us  magnify,  O

Simeon  receiveth  him  in  his  weak  arms,  crying.  Now 
lettest  thou  me  depart  to  the  bliss  beyond;  for  I  have 
beheld  thee  today  mantled  in  mortal  flesh,  O  thou  who 
rulest  life  and  art  Lord  of  death.     {Repeat.) 


February  2 — Presentation  of  Our  Lord         507 

O  Lord,  Sun  of  justice,  thou  hast  appeared  as  a  light 
for  the  revelation  of  the  Gentiles,  sitting  on  a  bright 
cloud,  fulfilling  the  shadowy  law  and  revealing  the 
beginning  of  the  new  grace.  Wherefore,  when  Simeon 
beheld  thee  he  lifted  his  voice,  crying,  Lettest  thou  me» 
depart  from  corruption;  for  I  have  today  beheld  thee. 

Thou  wast  incarnate  as  thou  wast  pleased  to  be,  being 
carried  in  the  arms  of  the  ever-virgin,  without  being 
separated  from  thy  Godhead  in  the,  bosom  of  the 
Father;  and  wast  delivered  into  the  hands  of  Simeon, 
the  God-receiver,  O  thou  who  boldest  all  creation  in 
thy  hand.  Wherefore,  he  shouted  with  joy,  crying, 
Now  lettest  thou  me,  thy  servant,  depart  in  peace;  for 
I  have  beheld  thee,  O  Master. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone  (by  Germanus)

^Then  the  Troparion  of  the  Feast;  and  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the 
church;  and  conclude  with  the  following  Kontakion,  in  the  First 
Tone. 

T^HOU,  O  Christ  God,  who  by  thy  Birth,  didst  sanc- 
tify the  Virgin's  womb,  and,  as  is  meet,  didst  bless 
Simeon's  arms,  and  didst  also  come  to  save  us;  preserve 
thy  fold  in  wars,  and  confirm  them  whom  thou  didst 
love;  for  thou  alone  art  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

The  Epistle:  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord.  For 
he  hath  regarded  the  humiliation  of  his  handmaid. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Hebrews  (7:7-17) 

A  ND  without  all  contradiction,  that  which  is  less, 
is  blessed  by  the  better. 

And  here  indeed,  men  that  die,  receive  tithes:  but 
there  he  hath  witness,  that  he  liveth. 

And  (as  it  may  be  said)  even  Levi  who  received 
tithes,  paid  tithes  in  Abraham: 

For  he  was  yet  in  the  loins  of  his  father,  when  Mel- 
chisedech  met  him. 

If  then  perfection  was  by  the  Levitical  priesthood, 
(for  under  it  the  people  received  the  law,)  what  fur- 
ther need  was  there  that  another  priest  should  rise  ac- 
cording to  the  order  of  Melchisedech,  and  not  be  called 
according  to  the  order  of  Aaron? 

For  the  priesthood  being  translated,  it  is  necessary 
that  a  translation  also  be  made  of  the  law. 

For  he,  of  whom  these  things  are  spoken,  is  of  an- 
other tribe,  of  which  no  one  attended  on  the  altar. 

For  it  is  evident  that  our  Lord  sprung  out  of  Juda: 
in  which  tribe  Moses  spoke  nothing  concerning  priests. 

And  it  is  yet  far  more  evident:  if  according  to  the 
similitude  of  Melchisedech  there  ariseth  another  priest. 

Who  is  made  not  according  to  the  law  of  a  carnal 
commandment,  but  according  to  the  power  of  an  in- 
dissoluble life: 

For  he  testifieth  :  Thou  art  a  priest  for  ever,  accord- 
ing to  the  order  of  Melchisedech. 


February  2 — Presentation  of  Our  Lord         509 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (2:22-40) 

TN  those  days;  his  parents  carried  the  child  Jesus  to 

Jerusalem,  to  present  him  to  the  Lord. 

As  it  is  written  in  the  law  of  the  Lord:  Every  male 
opening  the  womb  shall  be  called  holy  to  the  Lord: 

And  to  offer  a  sacrifice,  according  as  it  is  written  in 
the  law  of  the  Lord,  a  pair  of  turtledoves,  or  two  young 
pigeons : 

And  behold  there  was  a  man  in  Jerusalem  named 
Simeon,  and  this  man  was  just  and  devout,  waiting  for 
the  consolation  of  Israel:  and  the  Holy  Spirit  was  in 
him. 

And  he  had  received  an  answer  from  the  Holy  Spirit, 
that  he  should  not  see  death,  before  he  had  seen  the 
Christ  of  the  Lord. 

And  he  came  by  the  Spirit  into  the  temple.  And 
when  his  parents  brought  in  the  child  Jesus,  to  do  for 
him  according  to  the  custom  of  the  law, 

He  also  took  him  into  his  arms,  and  blessed  God,  and 
said: 

Now  thou  dost  dismiss  thy  servant,  O  Lord,  accord- 
ing to  thy  word  in  peace; 

Because  my  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation, 

Which  thou  hast  prepared  before  the  face  of  all 
peoples: 

A  light  to  the  revelation  of  the  Gentiles,  and  the  glory 
of  thy  people  Israel. 

And  his  father  and  mother  were  wondering  at  those 
things  which  were  spoken  concerning  him. 

And  Simeon  blessed  them,  and  said  to  Mary  his 
mother:  Behold  this  child  is  set  for  the  fall,  and  for 
the  resurrection  of  many  in  Israel,  and  for  a  sign  which 
shall  be  contradicted; 

And  thy  own  soul  a  sword  shall  pierce  that  out  of 
many  hearts,  thought  may  be  revealed. 

And  there  was  one  Anna,  a  prophetess,  the  daughter 
of  Phanuel,  of  the  tribe  of  Aser;  she  was  far  advanced 
in  years,  and  had  lived  with  her  husband  seven  years 
from  her  virginity. 


510  Menaion 

And  she  was  a  widow  until  fourscore  and  four  years; 
who  departed  not  from  the  temple,  by  fasting  and  pray- 
ers serving  night  and  day. 

Now  she,  at  the  same  hour,  coming  in,  confessed  to 
the  Lord;  and  spoke  of  him  to  all  that  looked  for  the 
redemption  of  Israel. 

And  after  they  had  performed  all  things  according 
to  the  law  of  the  Lord,  they  returned  into  Galilee,  ti,- 
their  city  Nazareth. 

And  the  child  grew,  and  waxed  strong,  full  of  wis- 
dom ;  and  the  grace  of  God  was  in  him.

March  9— The  Forty  Martyrs  513 

For  think  diligently  upon  him  that  endured  such 
opposition  from  sinners  against  himself;  that  you  be 
not  wearied,  fainting  in  your  minds. 

For  you  have  not  yet  resisted  unto  blood,  striving 
against  sin: 

And  you  have  forgotten  the  consolation,  which  speak- 
eth  to  you,  as  unto  children,  saying:  My  son,  neglect 
not  the  discipline  of  the  Lord;  neither  be  thou  wearied 
w^hilst  thou  art  rebuked  by  him. 

For  whom  the  Lord  loveth,  he  chastiseth;  and  he 
scourgeth  every  son  whom  he  receiveth. 

Persevere  under  discipline.  God  dealeth  with  you 
as  with  his  sons;  for  what  son  is  there,  whom  the  father 
doth  not  correct? 

But  if  you  be  without  chastisement,  whereof  all  are 
made  partakers,  then  are  you  bastards,  and  not  sons. 

Moreover  we  have  had  fathers  of  our  flesh,  for  in- 
structors, and  we  reverenced  them :  shall  we  not  much 
more  obey  the  Father  of  spirits,  and  live? 

And  they  indeed  for  a  few  days,  according  to  their 
own  pleasure,  instructed  us:  but  he,  for  our  profit,  that 
we  might  receive  his  sanctification. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (20:1-16) 

T~^HE  kingdom  of  heaven  is  like  to  an  householder, 
who  went  out  early  in  the  morning  to  hire  labourers 
in  his  vineyard. 

And  having  agreed  with  the  labourers  for  a  penny 
a  day,  he  sent  them  into  his  vineyard. 

And  going  out  about  the  third  hour,  he  saw  others 
standing  in  the  market  place  idle. 

And  he  said  to  them :  Go  you  also  into  my  vineyard, 
and  I  will  give  you  what  shall  be  just. 

And  they  went  their  way.  And  again  he  went  out 
about  the  sixth  and  the  ninth  hour,  and  did  in  like 
manner. 


514  Menaion 

But  about  the  eleventh  hour  he  went  out  and  found 
others  standing,  and  he  saith  to  them:  Why  stand  you 
here  all  the  day  idle? 

They  say  to  him :  Because  no  man  hath  hired  us.  He 
saith  to  them:  Go  you  also  into  my  vineyard. 

And  when  evening  was  come,  the  lord  of  the  vine- 
yard saith  to  his  steward:  Call  the  labourers  and  pay 
them  their  hire,  beginning  from  the  last  even  to  the 
first. 

When  therefore  they  were  come,  that  came  about  the 
eleventh  hour,  they  received  every  man  a  penny. 

But  when  the  first  also  came,  they  thought  that  they 
should  receive  more :  and  they  also  received  every  man 
a  penny. 

And  receiving  it  they  murmured  against  the  master 
of  the  house, 

Saying:  These  last  have  worked  but  one  hour,  and 
thou  hast  made  them  equal  to  us,  that  have  borne  the 
burden  of  the  day  and  the  heats. 

But  he  answering  said  to  one  of  them:  Friend,  I  do 
thee  no  wrong:  didst  thou  not  agree  with  me  for  a 
penny? 

Take  what  is  thine,  and  go  thy  way:  I  will  also  give 
to  this  last  even  as  to  thee. 

Or,  is  it  not  lawful  for  me  to  do  what  I  will?  is  thy 
eye  evil,  because  I  am  good? 

So  shall  the  last  be  first,  and  the  first  last.  For  many 
are  called,  but  few  chosen.

^l/'ERILY,  Gabriel  did  come  to  thee,  disclosing  the

Rejoice,  O  bridge  leading  to  the  heavens!  Rejoice,  O

fore, then,  dost  thou  utter  superhuman  things,  saying 
that  God  shall  be  with  me  and  dwell  in  my  womb? 
Tell  me,  how  am  I,  then,  to  become  a  spacious  place

ure, and  have  not  approached  wedlock.  How,  then

come, and  that  which  is  superhuman  is  accomplished. 
Wherefore,  O  all-pure  and  holy  one,  believe  thou  my

Peace,  he  announced  to  her  that  from  her  should  come 
the  Redeemer.  And  having  accepted  the  greeting  with

npODAY  is  the  Annunciation,  the  virginal  celebra- 
tion;  for  terrestrials  shall  unite  with  celestials, 
Adam  being  renewed  and  Eve  freed  of  the  first  sorrow. 
And  the  tabernacle  who  is  of  our  own  substance  hath 
become  a  temple  for  God,  by  deification  of  the  clay 
derived  from  her.  What  mystery,  the  incomprehens-

der, and  the  virgin  womb  receiving  the  Son.  The  Holy 
Spirit  is  sent,  and  on  high  the  Father  is  well  pleased.

nPHE  great  leader  of  the  immaterial  hosts  hath  come 
to  the  city  of  Nazareth  announcing  to  thee,  O  pure 
one,  the  Lord,  King  of  the  ages,  and  saying  unto  thee, 
Hail,  O  blessed  Mary,  thou  incomprehensible  and  in- 
explicable wonder,  and  the  reclaimer  of  mankind. 


Second  Kathisma,  in  the  Third  Tone 

nnODAY  the  whole  Creation  rejoiceth;  for  the  arch- 
angel hath  cried  unto  thee.  Hail,  O  blessed  one, 
spotless,  pure,  and  all-blameless.  Today  the  haughti- 
ness of  the  serpent  vanisheth,  as  the  bond  of  the  curse 
of  the  first  father  is  undone.  Wherefore,  with  all  things 
we  cry  unto  thee,  saying,  Hail  O  full  of  grace. 


Third  Kathisma,  in   the  Fourth   Tone 

T/ERH^Y,  Gabriel  lifteth  his  voice  to  thee  in  greet- 
ing, O  pure  one,  since  thou  carriest  in  thy  womb 
God  before  the  ages,  by  whose  Word  he  did  establish 
the  ends  of  the  earth.  And  Mary  replied,  saying,  I  have 
not  known  man.  How  then  shall  I  give  birth  to  a 
son?  For  who  hath  ever  seen  a  birth  without  seed?  The 
angel  explained  to  the  virgin  Theotokos,  saying,  The 
Holy  Spirit  shall  come  upon  thee,  and  the  power  of 
th-  Hvofhest  shall  overshadow  thee.

announcing  to  her  the  ineffable  joy,  that  she  should 
conceive  without  seed,  and  that  no  corruption  should 
touch  her,  crying,  Behold,  thou  shalt  give  birth  to  a 
Son  who  is  before  the  ages,  who  shall  deliver  his  people 
from  their  sins,  and  he  who  sent  me  to  hail  thee  testi-

shalt  remain  a  Virgin.

of  grace.  Hail,  O  groomless  and  unwedded  Maiden. 
Let  not  my  strange  appearance  dazzle  thee,  nor  be  dis- 
mayed at  me;  for  I  am  the  archangel.  Verily,  the  ser- 
pent did  deceive  Eve  of  old,  and  now  I  bring  thee  glad 
tidings  of  joy.  Thou  shalt  remain  without  corruption, 
and  shalt  give  birth  to  the  Lord,  O  pure  one. 

ilThe  Katabasias,  Open  my  mouth,  etc;  and  instead  of  the  Fourth

TPHE  transcendently  divine  Jesus,  sitting  in  glory  on 

the  throne  of  the  Godhead,  hath  come  on  a  bright

shadowed  the  three-day  Burial,  lifting  his  voice  and 
imploring,  Deliver  me  from  corruption,  O  Jesus,  King 
of  the  powers. 

^And  instead  of  the  Eighth,  the  following. 

ILJEARKEN,  O  Maiden,  -virgin  and  pure,  that 
Gabriel  may  tell  the  eternal  will  of  the  Highest. 
Make  thee  ready  to  receive  God;  for  the  Uncontain- 
able  shall,  through  thee,  mingle  with  mankind.  Where- 
fore, rejoicing,  I  cry.  Bless  the  Lord,  all  his  works. 

^Then  sing  the  Ninth  Ode,  repeating  the  following  Magnification 
on  each  of  its  Troparia. 

Receive,  O  earth,  the  glad  tidings  of  great  joy,  and 
ye  heavens,  praise  the  glory  of  God. 

npHE  Theotokos,  being  the  living  tabernacle  of  God, 
shall  never  be  touched  by  an  unclean  hand.  But 
the  lips  of  believers  shall  sing  unto  her  ceaselessly  with 
the  voice  of  angels,  crying  joyfully.  Hail,  O  full  of 
grace.    The  Lord  is  with  thee. 

Thou  hast  transcended  the  bounds  of  nature,  O 
Maiden,  having  conceived  God  in  an  ineffable  manner; 
for  being  of  a  perishable  nature,  thou  wast  exempted  in 
thy  birth-giving  from  that  which  pertaineth  to  mothers. 
Wherefore,  as  is  meet,  thou  dost  hear,  Hail,  O  full  of 
grace.  The  Lord  is  with  thee. 

How  dost  thou  overflow  with  milk,  O  undefiled  Vir- 
gin? Verily,  thou  hast  appeared  as  a  strange  manifes- 
tation, unutterable  by  human  tongue,  transcending  na- 
ture and  the  bounds  of  the  laws  of  birth.  Wherefore, 
thou  dost  hear,  as  is  meet.  Hail,  O  full  of  grace.  The 
Lord  is  with  thee. 

The  God-inspired  Scriptures,  O  Mother  of  the  High- 
est, have  spoken  of  thee  mystically;  for  Jacob  when  he 
saw  the  ladder  of  old,  which  was  a  foresign  of  thee, 
cried,  saying,  This  is  the  ascent  of  God.  Wherefore, 
as  is  meet,  thou  dost  hear,  Hail,  O  full  of  grace.  The 
Lord  is  with  thee. 


522  Menalon 

The  bush  and  the  fire  did  reveal  to  God-beholding 
Moses  a  wonderful  miracle.  And  seeking  the  fulfill- 
ment thereof  with  the  passing  of  time,  he  cried,  say- 
ing, I  shall  behold  her  who  is  a  spotless  Maiden,  who 
shall  be  addressed  with  rejoicing  as  the  Theotokos, 
Hail,  O  full  of  grace.    The  Lord  is  with  thee. 

Verily,  Daniel  called  thee  a  supersensuous  mountain, 
and  Isaiah  the  Mother  of  God.  Gideon  saw  thee  as  a 
fleece.  David  called  thee  a  sanctuary,  and  another  a 
door.  But  Gabriel  cried  unto  thee,  saying,  Hail,  O 
full  of  grace.    The  Lord  is  with  thee. 

^Then  conclude  with  the  Ninth  Ode  with  its  Magnification. 

Exapostetlarions 

^  I  ^HE  Leader  of  the  heavenly  hosts  was  sent  from 
Almighty  God  to  an  undefiled  Virgin  to  announce 
to  her  the  strange  and  ineffable  wonder  that  God  as 
Man  shall,  without  seed,  become  a  child  from  her, 
restoring  the  whole  creation  of  mankind.  Wherefore, 
ye  nations,  receive  the  glad  tidings  of  the  re-creation  of 
the  whole  world. 

Rejoice,  O  Theotokos,  O  deliverance  of  Adam  from 
the  curse!  Rejoice,  chaste  Theotokos!  Rejoice,  O  liv- 
ing bush!  Rejoice,  O  lamp!  Rejoice,  O  throne!  Re- 
joice, O  ladder  and  door!  Rejoice,  O  divine  chariot! 
Rejoice,  O  bright  cloud!  Rejoice,  O  temple,  O  most- 
gilded  jar!  Rejoice,  O  mountain!  Rejoice,  O  taber- 
nacle and  table!    Hail  to  thee,  O  deliverer  of  Eve! 

^And  in  the  Einos,  sing  the  following  four  Prosornia,  in  the  first 
Tone. 

T^ROM  the  arches  on  high  did  Gabriel  descend  com- 
ing  towards  Nazareth.  He  came  to  the  Virgin 
Mary,  lifting  his  voice  to  her  and  saying.  Hail ;  for  thou 
shalt  conceive  a  Son  older  than  Adam,  to  the  Maker 
and  Creator  of  the  ages,  who  delivereth  those  who  cry 
to  thee,  O  undefiled  one,  Hail! 


March  25 — The  Annunciation  52.^ 

From  heaven  did  Gabriel  come,  bringing  the  Annun- 
ciation to  the  Virgin,  and  crying  unto  her.  Hail;  for 
thou  dost  carry  in  thy  womb  him  who  shall  be  contained 
in  thee,  the  Uncontainable  in  space.  Thou  shalt  be  re- 
vealed as  carrying  him  who  shineth  forth  from  the 
Father,  before  the  morning  star. 

The  Word,  coeternal  with  the  Father  before  eternity, 
was  not  separated  from  the  celestials.  But  he  descended, 
through  his  exceeding  compassion,  to  those  who  are 
below,  taking  pity  on  our  stumbling  and  fall,  and  put- 
ting on  the  humility  of  Adam,  taking  on  a  strange  like- 
ness. 

The  transubstantial  Word,  appearing  eternally  from 
his  Father,  and  in  time  from  his  Mother,  taketh  on  the 
likeness  of  a  servant,  becoming  flesh,  without  separation 
from  the  Godhead  and  renewing  the  creation  of  Adam 
in  the  womb  of  her  who  conceived  him  without  seed. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Second  Tone  (by  Theophanis) 

nnODAY  is  disclosed  the  mystery  before  the  ages; 
and  the  Son  of  God  shall  become  the  Son  of  Man, 
that  by  his  adoption  of  the  lowest  he  may  grant  me  the 
highest.  Of  old  Adam  failed  to  become  a  God  as  he 
desired,  so  God  became  Man  that  Adam  might  become 
a  God.  Wherefore,  let  creation  rejoice,  and  nature  ex- 
change greetings,  for  the  archangel  did  stand  reverently 
before  the  Virgin  and  offered  her  joy  instead  of  sorrow. 
Wherefore,  O  our  God,  who  by  thy  compassion  became 
man,  glory  be  to  thee.

Tone. 

T/^ERILY,  I,  thy  city,  O  Theotokos,  inscribe  to  thee 
the  banners  of  conquest,  O  defending  soldier,  and 
offer  thee  thanks  as  a  deliverer  from  tribulations.  And 
since  thine  is  the  unconquerable  might,  deliver  me  from 
sundry  oppressions,  that  I  may  cry  unto  thee.  Rejoice, 
O  groomless  bride. 

The  Epistle:    My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord.    For 
he  hath  regarded  the  humiliation  of  his  handmaid. 
Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 

Ye  brethren:  For  both  he  that  sanctifieth  and  they 
who  are  sanctified,  etc.  (p.  394). 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (1:24-38) 

A  ND  in  those  days,  his  wife  Elisabeth  conceived, 
and  hid  herself  five  months,  saying: 

Thus  hath  the  Lord  dealt  with  me  in  the  days  where- 
in he  looked  on  me,  to  take  away  my  reproach  among 
men. 

And  in  the  sixth  month  the  angel  Gabriel  was  sent 
from  God  unto  a  city  of  Galilee,  named  Nazareth, 

To  a  virgin  espoused  to  a  man  whose  name  was  Jos- 
eph, of  the  house  of  David;  and  the  virgin's  name  was 
Mary. 

And  the  angel  came  in  with  her,  and  said.  Hail,  thou 
that  art  highly  favoured,  the  Lord  is  with  thee:  blessed 
art  thou  among  women. 

And  when  she  saw  him,  she  was  troubled  at  his  say- 
ing, and  cast  in  her  mind  what  manner  of  salutation  this 
should  be. 

And  the  angel  said  unto  her.  Fear  not,  Mary:  for 
thou  hast  found  favour  with  God. 


March  25 — The  Annunciation  525 

And,  behold,  thou  shalt  conceive  in  thy  womb,  and 
bring  forth  a  son,  and  shalt  call  his  name  Jesus. 

He  shall  be  great,  and  shall  be  called  the  Son  of  the 
Highest;  and  the  Lord  God  shall  give  unto  him  the 
throne  of  his  father  David: 

And  he  shall  reign  over  the  house  of  Jacob  for  ever; 
and  of  his  kingdom  there  shall  be  no  end. 

Then  said  Mary  unto  the  angel,  How  shall  this  be, 
seeing  I  know  not  a  man? 

And  the  angel  answered  and  said  unto  her,  The  Holy 
Spirit  shall  come  upon  thee,  and  the  power  of  the  High- 
est shall  overshadow  thee :  therefore  also  that  holy  thing 
which  shall  be  born  of  thee  shall  be  called  the  Son  of 
God. 

And,  behold,  thy  cousin  Elisabeth,  she  hath  also  con- 
ceived a  son  in  her  old  age;  and  this  is  the  sixth  month 
with  her,  who  was  called  barren. 

For  with  God  nothing  shall  be  impossible. 

And  Mary  said.  Behold  the  handmaid  of  the  Lord; 
be  it  unto  me  according  to  thy  word.  And  the  angel 
departed  from  her.

1 .   Vespers 

^On  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sinr/  the  following  six  Frosomia, 
in  the  Fourth  To7ie. 

r\  FIGHT-BEARING  George,  since  thou  art  brave 
^-^  among  the  Martyrs,  we  gather  today  to  extol  thee; 
for  thou  didst  finish  thy  course  and  keep  the  Faith,  re- 
ceiving from  God  the  crown  of  victory.  Wherefore, 
implore  thou  him  to  deliver  from  corruption  and  trib- 
ulations those  who  celebrate  in  faith  thy  ever-solemn 
memory. 

Thou  didst  go  forward  to  the  fight,  O  George,  with 
steadfast  energy,  confident  like  a  lion,  ignoring  the 
body,  since  it  shall  pass  away,  and  concerning  thyself 
wisely  with  the  incorruptible  spirit.  Wherefore,  wast 
thou  refined  with  all  kinds  of  sufferings,  as  gold  of 
seven-fold  purity. 

Thou  didst  sufifer  with  the  Saviour,  O  great  and  glor- 
ious Martyr  George,  resembling  him  by  thy  voluntary 
death.  Wherefore,  thou  dost  reign  with  him  mantled 
in  the  purple  of  thine  own  blood  and  adorned  with  the 
crown  of  thy  struggles,  exulting  in  the  crown  of  victory 
to  unending  ages. 

Thou  wast  fortified  with  the  shield  of  faith,  the  hel- 
met of  grace,  and  the  spear  of  the  Cross,  O  brave 
George,  becoming  indefeasable  against  thine  enemies. 
And  being  a  divine  hero,  thou  hast  vanquished  the  ranks 
of  Satans  and  dost  abide  with  the  angels;  and,  since 
thou  dost  watch  over  believers,  thou  dost  sanctify  and 
save  them  when  they  call  upon  thee. 

We  know  thee,  O  victory-mantled  George,  as  a  bril- 
liantly shining  star,  as  the  radiant  sun  in  the  firmament, 
as  a  pearl  of  great  price,  a  dazzling  precious  stone,  a 
son  of  the  day,  and  a  valiant  one  among  the  Martyrs. 


528  Menaion 

Guard  me,  O  all-blessed  George,  coming  to  my  help 
as  I  travel  by  sea,  or  walk  on  land,  or  sleep  by  night. 
Save  me  as  I  awake,  and  guide  me  to  do  the  Lord's  will, 
that  I  may  find  forgiveness  in  the  Day  of  Judgment  for 
what  I  have  done  in  life,  seeking  refuge  under  the  wing 
of  thy  protection. 

Glory,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

^  I  ^HOU  hast  walked  according  to  thy  name,  O  George 
^  the  soldier;  for,  in  carrying  the  cross  of  Christ  on 
thy  shoulder,  thou  didst  plough  the  earth,  made  barren 
by  the  errors  of  Satan;  and  having  uprooted  the  thorns 
of  heathen  worship  thou  didst  plant  the  vine  of  Ortho- 
dox faith.  Wherefore,  thou  dost  bud  healing  to  be- 
lievers in  all  the  inhabited  world,  and  having  become  a 
faithful  husbandman  of  the  Trinity,  we  beseech  thee  to 
intercede  for  the  safety  of  the  world  and  the  salvation 
of  our  souls.

By  John  of  Damascus 

'V/'ERILY,  Solomon  did  cry  out.  Let  the  eyelids  of 
men  gaze  straight;  for  he  foretold  that  whosoever 
shall  look  straight  shall  have  mercy  from  Christ  God. 
Readily  didst  thou  hearken  to  this,  O  most-contending 
George,  following  the  teachings  of  Christ.  And  when 
thou  w^ast  delivered  to  the  evil  ones  thou  didst  refuse 
unflinchingly  the  sacrifices  of  error,  because  they  are 
impure;  and  thy  body,  which  thou  didst  ofifer  for  the 
sake  of  the  Creator's  love,  was  severed  member  by  mem- 
ber. But  the  deceitful  enemy  was  wholly  wounded 
when,  seeing  thee  wearing  the  crown  and  exulting,  he 
was  confounded.  Wherefore,  as  thou  abidest  with  thy 
Master  and  the  powers  on  high,  intercede,  O  champion 
of  Christ,  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls. 

^In  the  Aposticha,  the  following  Prosomia,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 


April  23— St.  George  529 

nPHE  nations  praise  with  psalms  and  songs  thine 
ever-memorable  feast,  O  George;  for  it  hath  shone 
forth  resplendent  and  clothed  with  light,  adorned  with 
glory  and  grace.  Wherefore,  the  myriads  of  angels 
and  Martyrs  with  the  Apostles  applaud  the  trophies  of 
thy  struggles,  O  Martyr,  praising  Christ  our  God,  the 
Saviour,  who  glorified  thee.  Implore  thou  him,  there- 
fore, to  illuminate  and  save  our  souls. 

Stichos:    The  just  shall  flourish  like  a  palm  tree. 

Thou  hast  become  a  shield-bearer  for  Christ,  being 
found  by  those  who  sought  thee  not.  Thou  wast  con- 
sumed by  fire  for  the  sake  of  Christ,  disdaining  the  soul- 
corrupting  error  of  false  gods.  Then  didst  thou  cry 
out  to  the  law-transgressors,  saying,  I  am  enlisting  as  a 
soldier  of  Christ,  my  King.  Neither  beasts,  therefore, 
nor  wheels,  nor  fire,  nor  sword  can  separate  me  from  the 
love  of  Christ  our  God.  Wherefore,  implore  thou  him 
to  illuminate  and  save  our  souls. 

Stichos:  The  Lord  hath  made  his  saints  a  wonder. 

O  crown-wearing  George,  thou  didst  make  light  of

ting tools,  finishing  the  course  of  martyrdom  in  true 
worship.  Wherefore,  with  the  flowers  of  paeans  we 
crown  thy  most  resplendent  memory,  greeting  thy  ven- 
erable members  in  faith.  And  as  thou  standest,  light- 
mantled,  before  the  throne  of  Christ  our  God,  beseech 
thou  him  to  illuminate  and  save  our  souls. 

Glory,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

J  ET  us,  brethren,  extol  spiritually  that  supersensu- 
^^  ous  intelligence  of  diamond  firmness,  the  ever- 
memorable  Martyr  George  who,  having  enthusiasti- 
cally declared  for  Christ,  by  dangers  and  sufferings 
hardened  and  exercised  his  perishable  body,  after  na- 
ture, which  was  melted  away  by  various  torments. 
Albeit,  love  conquered  nature  and  persuaded  the  lover 
to  reach,  through  death,  to  the  Beloved,  Christ  God  the 
Saviour  of  our  souls.

CINCE  thou  art  a  liberator  and  deliverer  of  captives, 
a  help  and  succour  of  the  poor  and  needy,  a  healing

Saint. 

First  Kathisma,  in  the  First  Tone 

OEHOLD,  the  Spring  of  grace  hath  flourished,  and 
^^  for  all  hath  risen  the  Resurrection  of  Christ:  and 
with  them  doth  shine  forth  the  all-adored  day,  light- 
mantled,  the  day  of  the  Martyr  George.  Wherefore, 
let  us  altogether  joyfully  celebrate  it,  wrapped  with 
splendour  in  a  divine  manner. 

Second  Kathisma,  in  the  Third  Tone 

Q  VICTORY-CLAD  and  all-blessed  George,  when 
thou  didst  fervently  seek  Christ,  thou  didst  bravely 
demolish  the  chambers  of  error;  and  in  the  battle-field 
thou  didst  confess  Christ.  Wherefore,  O  glorious 
Martyr,  implore  Christ  God  to  grant  us  the  Great 
Mercy. 

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

T^HOU  didst  diligently  sow  the  seeds  of  divine  com- 
mandments, O  glorious  Martyr,  distributing  thy 
whole  wealth  piously  to  the  poor,  gaining  in  its  place 
Christ's  glory.  Wherefore,  thou  didst  hasten  towards 
unceasing  struggles  and  sufferings  confidently.  And 
when  thou  didst  become  a  partaker  with  the  Passionless 
in  his  Passion  and  Resurrection,  thou  enjoyedst  his 
kingdom,  imploring  him  now  for  our  sakes.

from  earth  to  a  heavenly  passover.  And  therewith  doth

rejoicing,  that  we  may  become  worthy  of  the  divine

^-^  festal  Feast  of  the  glorious  Resurrection,  celebrate 
also  the  joyful  anniversary  of  the  Martyr  George,  and

crown  him  with  vernal  flowers,  for  he  is  unconquerable, 
that,  by  his  beseechings,  we  may  attain  liberation  from 
sins  and  sorrows. 

To  him  who  granted  thee  the  perfection  of  life,  O 
all-blessed  George,  thou  didst  offer  thyself  wholly  as 
a  breathing,  living  burnt-ofifering,  a  pure  and  well- 
accepted  sacrifice.  Wherefore,  thou  hast  become  a  fer- 
vid intercessor,  O  Martyr,  delivering  from  oppressions 
those  who  extol  thee  and  call  on  thee  in  faith. 

When  thou  didst  diligently  till  the  seed  of  the  Word, 
sown  in  thy  pure  self,  O  blessed  one,  thou  didst  culti- 
vate it  with  hardships  and  struggles;  and  wisely  having 
treasured  it  in  the  heavenly  garner,  thou  didst  find  the 
immortal  bliss,  wherein  thou  dost  now  delight.  By  thine 
intercessions  with  God,  preserve  those  who  extol  thee 
in  faith. 

O  struggle-bearing  Martyr  of  Christ,  save  by  thine 
intercessions  those  who  are  in  various  tribulations,  de- 
livering them  from  all  oppressions,  and  putting  away 
from  them  evil,  soul-corrupting  dismay,  seeking  for  us 
grace  and  mercy,  that,  being;  delivered  by  thine  inter- 
cessions, we  may  all  honour  in  joy  thy  solemn  struggles. 

Glory,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

CPRING  hath  shone  forth;  come,  let  us  be  glad;  the 
Resurrection  of  Christ  hath  occurred;  come,  let  us 
rejoice;  for  the  memorial  of  the  struggle-bearing  one 
hath  appeared  unto  those  who  believe.  Wherefore, 
O  feast-lovers,  let  us  celebrate  it  mystically;  for  this 
one,  being  a  good  soldier,  did  prevail  over  the  usurpers 
and  disappoint  them,  becoming  an  emulator  of  Christ 
in  his  Passion,  not  pitying  his  earthly  vessel.  Rather 
did  he  leave  it  naked  as  brass,  rewarding  it  with  tor- 
ments. Wherefore,  let  us  lift  our  voices  to  him,  crying, 
O  struggle-bearer,  plead  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls.

The  Epistle:  The  just  shall  rejoice  in  the  Lord. 
Hear,  O  God,  my  voice. 

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Holy  Apostles  (12:1-11) 
A  ND  at  the  same  time,  Herod  the  king  stretched 
^  ^  forth  his  hands,  to  afflict  some  of  the  church. 

And  he  killed  James,  the  brother  of  John,  with  the 
sword. 

And  seeing  that  it  pleased  the  Jews,  he  proceeded  to 
take  up  Peter  also.  Now  it  was  in  the  days  of  the 
Asymes. 

And  when  he  had  apprehended  him,  he  cast  him  into 
prison,  delivering  him  to  four  files  of  soldiers  to  be 
kept,  intending,  after  the  pasch,  to  bring  him  forth  to 
the  people. 

Peter  therefore  was  kept  in  prison.  But  prayer  was 
made  without  ceasing  by  the  church  unto  God  for  him. 

And  when  Herod  would  have  brought  him  forth,  the 
same  night  Peter  was  sleeping  between  two  soldiers, 
bound  with  two  chains :  and  the  keepers  before  the  door 
kept  the  prison. 

And  behold  an  angel  of  the  Lord  stood  by  him :  and 
a  light  shined  in  the  room:  and  he  striking  Peter  on 
the  side,  raised  him  up,  saying:  Arise  quickly.  And 
the  chains  fell  off  from  his  hands. 

And  the  angel  said  to  him:  Gird  thyself  and  put  on 
thy  sandals.  And  he  did  so.  And  he  said  to  him:  Cast 
thy  garment  about  thee,  and  follow  me. 

And  going  out,  he  followed  him,  and  he  knew  not 
that  it  was  true  which  was  done  by  the  angel:  but 
thought  he  saw  a  vision. 

And  passing  through  the  first  and  the  second  ward, 
they  came  to  the  iron  gate  that  leadeth  to  the  city,  which 
of  itself  opened  to  them.    And  going  out,  they  passed 


534  Menaion 

on  through  one  street:  and  immediately  the  angel  de- 
parted from  him. 

And  Peter  coming  to  himself,  said:  Now  I  know  in 
very  deed,  that  the  Lord  hath  sent  his  angel,  and  hath 
delivered  me  out  of  the  hand  of  Herod,  and  from  all 
the  expectation  of  the  people  of  the  Jews.

^TpHOU  hast  granted  our  king  thy  precious  cross  as

compassion,  becoming  worthy  of  the  kingdom  of 
heaven.  Wherefore,  with  him,  we  glorify  thy  philan-

Thou  hast  granted  thy  pious  servant,  O  Lover  of 
mankind,  the  wisdom  of  Solomon,  the  meekness  of 
David,  and  the  Orthodoxy  of  the  Apostles;  since  thou 
art  King  of  kings  and  Lord  of  all  lords.  Wherefore, 
we  glorify  thy  philanthropic  dispensation,  O  Almighty 
Jesus,  Saviour  of  our  souls. 

By  thy  might,  O  ever-memorable  king,  thou  wast  the 
first  to  subjugate  the  purple  to  Christ  willingly;  for 
thou  hast  made  him  known  as  God  and  King  of  all,  a 
Benefactor  of  all,  the  Vanquisher  of  every  leadership, 
and  the  Superior  of  every  sovereign.  Henceforth,  O

adopting  the  life-giving  Cross  as  an  unconquerable 
weapon,  and  through  it  thou  didst  draw  near  to  our 
God.

verse with  its  reviving  waters!  Rejoice,  O  stem  from

of  Christ!  Rejoice,  O  glorious  one,  the  pride  of  all 
quarters  of  the  earth!  Rejoice  O  first  of  Christian 
kings!    Hail,  O  gladness  of  believers. 

The  King  of  creation,  O  all-wise  ones,  having  fore- 
seen the  goodness  of  thy  heart's  submission,  caught  thee 
supersensuously,  being  formerly  in  the  control  of  bes- 
tiality, enlightening  thy  mind  with  the  knowledge  of 
true  worship,  and  revealing  thee  to  the  world,  as  a  light- 
radiating  sun,  sending  forth  the  rays  of  thy  divine 
works,  O  glorious  one.

choice  land  didst  receive  the  commandments  of  God,

hearts  with  the  example  of  thy  conduct.  Wherefore, 
we  celebrate  the  day  of  thy  memorial  in  feasting  and 
joy. 

Thou  hast  anointed  thy  partakers,  Constantine  and 
Helen,  O  Christ,  with  the  oil  of  rejoicing  in  a  strange 
manner;  for  they  hated  error  and  desired  thy  heavenly

ever-memorable  Paul,  saying.  By  this  thou  shalt  con- 
quer. And  having  sought  him  with  thy  godly-minded 
mother  and  found  him  according  to  thy  desire,  thou 
didst  persuade  them.  Wherefore,  with  her,  beseech 
thou  him  who  alone  is  the  Lover  of  mankind,  in  behalf

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Pure  Apostles 
(26:1,12-20) 

AT  that  time:  Agrippa  said  to  Paul:  Thou  art  pcr- 
^  mitted  to  speak  for  thyself.  Then  Paul,  stretch- 
ing forth  his  hand,  began  to  make  his  answer. 

When  I  was  going  to  Damascus,  with  authority  and 
permission  of  the  chief  priests, 

At  midday,  O  king,  I  saw  in  the  way  a  light  from 
heaven  above  the  brightness  of  the  sun,  shining  round 
about  me,  and  them  that  were  in  company  with  mc. 

And  when  we  were  all  fallen  down  on  the  ground, 
I  heard  a  voice  speaking  to  me  in  the  Hebrew  tongue: 
Saul,  Saul,  why  persecutest  thou  me?  It  is  hard  for 
thee  to  kick  against  the  goad. 

And  I  said:  Who  art  thou,  Lord?  And  the  Lord 
answered :  I  am  Jesus  whom  thou  persecutest. 

But  rise  up,  and  stand  upon  thy  feet:  for  to  this  end 
have  I  appeared  to  thee,  that  I  may  make  thee  a  min- 
ister, and  a  witness  of  those  things  which  thou  hast  seen, 
and  of  those  things  wherein  I  will  appear  to  thee. 

Delivering  thee  from  the  people,  and  from  the  na- 
tions, unto  which  now  I  send  thee: 

To  open  their  eyes,  that  they  may  be  converted  from 
darkness  to  light,  and  from  the  power  of  Satan  to  God, 
that  they  may  receive  forgiveness  of  sins,  and  a  lot 
among  the  saints,  by  the  faith  that  is  in  me. 

Whereupon,  O  king  Agrippa,  I  was  not  incredulous 
to  the  heavenly  vision : 

But  to  them  first  that  are  at  Damascus,  and  at  Jeru- 
salem,, and  unto  all  the  country  of  Judea,  and  to  the 
Gentiles  did  I  preach,  that  they  should  do  penance,  and 
turn  to  God,  doing  works  worthy  of  penance.

rj^ORASMUCH  as  many  have  taken  in  hand  to  set 
forth  in  order  a  narration  of  the  things  that  have 
been  accomplished  among  us; 

According  as  they  have  delivered  them  unto  us,  who 
from  the  beginning  were  eyewitnesses  and  ministers  of 
the  word: 


June  24 — Nativity  of  the  Forerunner        545 

It  seemed  good  to  me  also,  having  diligently  attained 
to  all  things  from  the  beginning,  to  write  to  thee  in 
order,  most  excellent  Theophilus, 

That  thou  mayest  know  the  verity  of  those  words  in 
which  thou  hast  been  instructed. 

There  was  in  the  days  of  Herod,  the  king  of  Judea, 
a  certain  priest  named  Zachary,  of  the  course  of  Abia; 
and  his  wife  was  of  the  daughters  of  Aaron,  and  her 
name  Elizabeth. 

And  they  were  both  just  before  God,  walking  in  all 
the  commandments  and  justifications  of  the  Lord  with- 
out blame. 

And  they  had  no  son,  for  that  Elizabeth  was  barren, 
and  they  both  were  well  advanced  in  years. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  when  he  executed  the  priestly 
function  in  the  order  of  his  course  before  God, 

According  to  the  custom  of  the  priestly  office,  it  was 
his  lot  to  offer  incense,  going  into  the  temple  of  the 
Lord. 

And  all  the  multitude  of  the  people  was  praying 
without,  at  the  hour  of  incense. 

And  there  appeared  to  him  an  angel  of  the  Lord, 
standing  on  the  right  side  of  the  altar  of  incense. 

And  Zachary  seeing  him,  was  troubled,  and  fear  fell 
upon  him. 

But  the  angel  said  to  him:  Fear  not,  Zachary,  for 
thy  prayer  is  heard;  and  thy  wife  Elizabeth  shall  bear 
thee  a  son,  and  thou  shalt  call  his  name  John: 

And  thou  shalt  have  joy  and  gladness,  and  many  shall 
rejoice  in  his  nativity. 

For  he  shall  be  great  before  the  Lord ;  and  shall  drink 
no  wine  nor  strong  drink:  and  he  shall  be  filled  with 
the  Holy  Ghost,  even  from  his  mother's  womb. 

And  he  shall  convert  many  of  the  children  of  Israel 
to  the  Lord  their  God. 

And  he  shall  go  before  him  in  the  spirit  and  power  of 
Elias;  that  he  may  turn  the  hearts  of  the  fathers  unto 


546  Menajon 

the  children,  and  the  incredulous  to  the  wisdom  ol  the 
just,  to  prepare  unto  the  Lord  a  perfect  people. 

And  Zachary  said  to  the  angel:  Whereby  shall  I 
know  this?  for  I  am  an  old  man,  and  my  wife  is  ad- 
vanced in  years. 

And  the  angel  answering,  said  to  him:  I  am  Gabriel, 
who  stand  before  God;  and  am  sent  to  speak  to  thee, 
and  to  bring  thee  these  good  tidings. 

And  behold,  thou  shalt  be  dumb,  and  shalt  not  b^ 
able  to  speak  until  the  day  wherein  these  things  shall 
come  to  pass,  because  thou  hast  not  believed  my  words, 
which  shall  be  fulfilled  in  their  time. 

And  the  people  were  waiting  for  Zachary;  and  they 
wondered  that  he  tarried  so  long  in  the  temple. 

And  when  he  came  out,  he  could  not  speak  to  them : 
and  they  understood  that  he  had  seen  a  vision  in  the 
temple.  And  he  made  signs  to  them,  and  remained 
dumb. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  after  the  days  of  his  office  were 
accomplished,  he  departed  to  his  own  house. 

And  after  those  days,  Elizabeth  his  wife  conceived, 
and  hid  herself  five  months,  saying: 

Thus  hath  the  Lord  dealt  with  me  in  the  days  where- 
in he  hath  had  regard  to  take  away  my  reproach  among 
men. 

And  when  Elizabeth's  full  time  of  being  delivered 
was  come,  and  she  brought  forth  a  son. 

And  her  neighbours  and  kinsfolks  heard  that  the 
Lord  had  showed  his  great  mercy  towards  her,  and 
they  congratulated  with  her. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  that  on  the  eighth  day  they  came 
to  circumcise  the  child,  and  they  called  him  by  his 
father's  name  Zachary. 

And  his  mother  answering,  said :  Not  so;  but  he  shall 
be  called  John. 

And  they  said  to  her:  There  is  none  of  thy  kindred 
that  is  called  by  this  name. 

And  they  made  signs  to  his  father,  how  he  would 
have  him  called. 


June  29— Sts.  Peter  and  Paul  547 

And  demanding  a  writing  table,  he  wrote,  saying: 
John  is  his  name.    And  they  all  wondered. 

And  immediately  his  mouth  was  opened,  and  his 
tongue  loosed,  and  he  spoke,  blessing  God. 

And  fear  came  upon  all  their  neighbours;  and  all 
these  things  were  noised  abroad  over  all  the  hill  coun- 
try of  Judea. 

And  all  they  that  had  heard  them  laid  them  up  in 
their  heart,  saying:  What  an  one,  think  ye,  shall  this 
child  be?    For  the  hand  of  the  Lord  was  with  him. 

And  Zachary  his  father  was  filled  with  the  Holy 
Spirit;  and  he  prophesied,  saying: 

Blessed  be  the  Lord  God  of  Israel;  because  he  hath 
visited  and  wrought  the  redemption  of  his  people: 

And  thou,  child,  shalt  be  called  the  prophet  of  the 
Highest:  for  thou  shalt  go  before  the  face  of  the  Lord 
to  prepare  his  ways: 

And  the  child  grew,  and  was  strengthened  in  spirit; 
and  was  in  the  deserts  until  the  day  of  his  manifestation 
to  Israel.

with  rods,  stoning,  crossing  of  wildernesses,  and  drown-

tacle to  angels  and  men,  bearing  all  with  the  help  of 
Christ  who  established  thee.  Wherefore,  we,  who  cele- 
brate thy  memorial  in  faith,  beseech  thee  to  intercede

Stichos:    The  heavens  show  forth  the  glory  of  God. 

Let  us  extol  Peter  and  Paul,  the  two  great  luminaries 
of  the  Church;  for  they  did  shine  forth  in  the  firma- 
ment of  faith,  transcending  the  sun  in  brilliancy;  by 
the  rays  of  whose  preaching  they  led  forth  the  Gentiles 
from  ignorance  into  divine  knowledge.  Wherefore, 
one  of  them  was  nailed  upon  the  Cross,  making  his  way 
unto  heaven  where  he  received  the  keys  of  the  kingdom

the  sword,  and  was  carried  to  the  Saviour,  being  blessed 
as  is  meet;  both  declaring  that  Israel  laid  hand  against 
the  Lord  unjustly.  By  their  petitions,  therefore,  O 
Christ  our  God,  demolish  our  enemies  and  establish  the 
Orthodox  Faith;  for  thou  art  the  Lover  of  mankind.

t-JAVING  abandoned  the  fishing  grounds  thou  didst 
receive  from  the  Father  himself  the  revelation  of 
the  Word's  Incarnation,  and  as  one  who  is  privileged 
thou  didst  cry  to  all,  saying  unto  thy  Creator,  I  have 
known  thee  as  Son  of  God,  consubstantial  with  him. 
Wherefore,  thou  wast  truly  revealed  as  the  rock  of 
faith,  as  is  meet,  and  a  trustee  of  the  keys  of  grace.  In- 
tercede, therefore,  O  Apostle  Peter  with  Christ  God  to 
grant  forgiveness  of  iniquities  to  those  who  eagerly 
celebrate  thy  memorial. 

From  heaven,  from  Christ  God,  thou  didst  receive 
the  call,  thus  appearing  as  the  preacher  of  light,  illum- 
inating all  with  the  teachings  of  grace;  for  having  im- 
pugned the  worship  of  the  written  law,  thou  didst  cause 
to  rise  the  knowledge  of  the  Spirit  for  believers.  There- 
fore, worthily  thou  didst  ascend  to  the  third  heaven  and 
attained  paradise.  Wherefore,  O  Apostle  Paul,  inter- 
cede with  Christ  God  to  grant  forgiveness  of  iniquities 
to  those  who  eagerly  celebrate  thy  holy  memorial. 

Let  us  extol  those  two  great  luminaries  of  exceeding 
radiance,  the  all-wise  Peter  and  Paul,  who  have  been 
manifested  as  heads  of  the  Disciples,  radiating  with  the 
fire  of  the  divine  Spirit,  and  burning  up  the  darkness 
of  error,  thus  attaining  worthily  their  abode  in  the 
kingdom  on  high,  being  equal  in  grace  and  rank. 
Wherefore,  we  cry  unto  them,  saying,  O  Apostles  of 
Christ  God,  seek  forgiveness  of  iniquities  for  those  who 
eagerly  celebrate  your  holy  memorial.

^^  those  divine  heads  of  the  Apostles,  luminaries  of 
the  universe  and  preachers  of  the  Faith,  those  two 
trumpets  declaring  things  divine  and  revealing  doc-

error. 

The  great  and  amazing  mystery  of  thy  birth-giving, 
O  virgin  Theotokos,  favoured  of  God,  was  preached  by 
the  Prophets,  taught  by  the  Apostles,  and  confessed  by 
Martyrs.  Yea,  it  is  praised  by  the  angels  and  wor- 
shipped by  men. 

^Ajid  in  the  Einos,  the  following  Prosomia,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

^A7HEN  the  Saviour  asked  the  rank  of  the  twelve 
Disciples,  Who  do  men  say  that  I  am?  Then 
Peter,  the  forechosen  of  the  Disciples  and  recipient  of 
grace  from  heaven,  proclaimed  thee  clearly,  speaking 
of  thy  Godhead,  and  saying.  Thou  art  Christ  the  Son 
of  the  living  God.  Wherefore,  it  is  meet  to  beatify 
him,  since  he  received  the  revelation  from  above  and 
the  gift  to  bind  and  loosen  sins. 

O  thou  who  wast  called  from  above  and  not  from 
man,  when  the  earthly  darkness  covered  the  eyes  of  thy 
body,  revealing  the  dismay  of  infidelity,  then  the  heav- 
enly light  gleamed  forth  in  thy  mind's  eye,  revealing 
the  splendour  of  true  worship.  Wherefore,  thou  didst 
know  Christ  our  God,  who  bringeth  out  light  from 
darkness.  Plead  thou  with  him  to  lighten  and  save  our 
souls. 


June  29— Sts.  Peter  and  Paul  553 

Worthily  thou  wast  called  the  rock,  on  which  the 
Lord  established  the  unshakeable  Faith  of  the  Church, 
making  thee  the  head  shepherd  of  the  sheep  endowed 
with  speech.  And  then,  since  thou  art  good,  he  appoint- 
ed thee  keeper  of  the  keys  of  the  heavenly  gates,  to  open 
unto  those  who  hasten  thither  with  faith.  Wherefore, 
thou  wast  counted  worthy  to  be  crucified  as  thy  Master 
was  crucified.  Plead  thou  with  him  to  lighten  and 
save  our  souls. 

O  preacher  of  Christ  and  proud  bearer  of  his  cross, 
thou  didst  sincerely  prefer  to  all  things  the  greatly  de- 
sired divine  love,  since  it  linketh  its  lovers  to  the  Be- 
loved. Then  thou  wast  called  a  captive  of  Christ, 
choosing  the  disasters  of  temptations,  considering  them 
sweeter  than  all  bliss.  Thus  thou  wast  worthy  of  the 
precious  dissolution,  attaining  thy  Master.  Wherefore, 
plead  thou  with  him  to  lighten  and  save  our  souls.

The  Epistle:  Their  sound  hath  gone  forth  into  all 
the  earth.     The  heavens  show  forth  the  glory  of  God. 

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (11:21  to  end;    12:6-9) 

VT'E  brethren:  Whatever  any  man  dare  (I  speak  fool- 
^    ishly),  I  dare  also. 

They  are  Hebrews:  so  am  I.  They  are  Israelites: 
so  am  I.    They  are  the  seed  of  Abraham:  so  am  I. 

They  are  the  ministers  of  Christ  (I  speak  as  one  less 
wise)  :  I  am  more;  in  many  more  labours,  in  prisons 
more  frequently,  in  stripes  above  measure,  in  deaths 
often. 

Of  the  Jews  five  times  did  I  receive  forty  stripes, 
save  one. 

Thrice  was  I  beaten  with  rods,  once  I  was  stoned, 
thrice  I  suffered  shipwreck,  a  night  and  a  day  I  was  in 
the  depth  of  the  sea. 

In  journeying  often,  in  perils  of  waters,  in  perils  of 
robbers,  in  perils  from  my  own  nation,  in  perils  from 
the  Gentiles,  in  perils  in  the  city,  in  perils  in  the  wilder- 
ness, in  perils  in  the  sea,  in  perils  from  false  brethren. 

In  labour  and  painfulness,  in  much  watchings,  in 
hunger  and  thirst,  in  fastings  often,  in  cold  and  naked- 
ness. 

Besides  those  things  which  are  without:  my  daily 
instance,  the  solicitude  for  all  the  churches. 

Who  is  weak,  and  I  am  not  weak?  Who  is  scanda- 
lized, and  I  am  not  on  fire? 

If  I  must  needs  glory,  I  will  glory  of  the  things  that 
concern  my  infirmity. 

The  God  and  Father  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who 
is  blessed  for  ever,  knoweth  that  I  lie  not. 

At  Damascus,  the  governor  of  the  nation  under  Are- 
tas  the  king,  guarded  the  city  of  the  Damascenes,  to 
apprehend  me. 


June  29— Sts.  Peter  and  Paul  55^^ 

And  through  a  window  in  a  basket  was  I  let  down 
by  the  wall,  and  so  escaped  his  hands. 

For  though  I  should  have  a  mind  to  glory,  I  shall 
not  be  foolish;  for  I  will  say  the  truth.  But  I  forbear, 
lest  any  man  should  think  of  me  above  that  which  he 
seeth  in  me,  or  any  thing  he  heareth  from  me. 

And  lest  the  greatness  of  the  revelations  should  exalt 
me,  there  was  given  me  a  sting  of  my  flesh,  an  angel 
of  Satan,  to  buffet  me. 

For  which  thing  thrice  I  besought  the  Lord,  that  it 
might  depart  from  me. 

And  he  said  to  me:  My  grace  is  sufficient  for  thee: 
for  power  is  made  perfect  in  infirmity.  Gladly,  there- 
fore, will  I  glory  in  my  infirmities,  that  the  power  of 
Christ  may  dwell  in  me. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (16:13-19) 

A  T  that  time:  When  Jesus  came  into  the  quarters  of 
Caesarea  Philippi:  and  he  asked  his  disciples,  say- 
ing: Whom  do  men  say  that  the  Son  of  man  is? 

But  they  said  :  Some  John  the  Baptist,  and  other  some 
Elias,  and  others  Jeremias,  or  one  of  the  prophets. 

Jesus  saith  to  them :  But  whom  do  you  say  that  I  am? 

Simon  Peter  answered  and  said :  Thou  art  Christ,  the 
Son  of  the  living  God. 

And  Jesus  answering,  said  to  him:  Blessed  art  thou, 
Simon  Bar-Jona:  because  flesh  and  blood  hath  not  re- 
vealed it  to  thee,  but  my  Father  who  is  in  heaven. 

And  I  say  to  thee:  That  thou  art  Peter;  and  upon 
this  rock  I  will  build  my  church,  and  the  gates  of  hell 
shall  not  prevail  against  it. 

And  I  will  give  to  thee  the  keys  of  the  kingdom  of 
heaven.  And  whatsoever  thou  shalt  bind  upon  earth, 
it  shall  be  bound  also  in  heaven:  and  whatsoever  thou 
shalt  loose  on  earth,  it  shall  be  loosed  also  in  heaven.

/^^HRIST  the  Rock  doth  openly  glorify  the  rock  of 
^-^  faith,  forechosen  from  the  Disciples,  with  Paul  and 
the  whole  rank  of  the  Twelve,  and  as  we  celebrate  today 
their  memorial,  we  glorify  him  who  glorified  them. 

The  Epistle:  First  Corinthians  (4:9-16) 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (9:36-38;  10:1-8) 

A  ND  seeing  the  multitude,  he  had  compassion  on 
them;  because  they  were  distressed,  and  lying  like 
sheep  that  have  no  shepherd. 

Then  he  saith  to  his  disciples.  The  harvest  indeed 
is  great,  but  the  labourers  are  few. 

Pray  ye,  therefore,  the  Lord  of  the  harvest,  that  he 
send  forth  labourers  into  his  harvest. 

And  having  called  his  twelve  disciples  together,  he 
gave  them  power  over  unclean  spirits,  to  cast  them  out, 
and  to  heal  all  manner  of  diseases,  and  all  manner  of 
infirmities. 

And  the  names  of  the  twelve  apostles  are  these:  The 
first,  Simon  who  is  called  Peter,  and  Andrew  his 
brother, 

James  the  son  of  Zebedee,  and  John  his  brother, 
Philip  and  Bartholomew,  Thomas  and  Matthew  the 
publican,  and  James  the  son  of  Alpheus,  and  Thad- 
deus, 

Simon  the  Cananean,  and  Judas  Iscariot,  who  also 
betrayed  him. 

These  twelve  Jesus  sent:  commanding  them,  saying: 
Go  ye  not  into  the  way  of  the  Gentiles,  and  into  the 
city  of  the  Samaritans  enter  ye  not. 

But  go  ye  rather  to  the  lost  sheep  of  the  house  of 
Israel. 

And  going,  preach,  saying:  The  kingdom  of  heaven 
is  at  hand. 

Heal  the  sick,  raise  the  dead,  cleanse  the  lepers,  cast 
out  devils :  freely  have  you  received,  freely  give.

Sunday  of  the  Holy  Fathers 
Assembled  in  the  First  Six  Ecumenical  Councils 

From  July  13th-lQth 

1.   Vespers 

C^'^  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sing  six  for  the  Resurrection,  in 
the  Tone  in  use;  and  four  for  the  Fathers,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 

Q  PHILANTHROPIC  Word,  boundless  and  in- 
describable, having  become  incarnate  for  our  sake, 
the  solemn  Assembly  of  the  wise  Fathers  proclaimed 
thee,  that  thou  art  perfect  God  and  perfect  Man,  com- 
plete, dual  of  Nature  and  acts,  and  dual  also  of  Will, 
and  that  thou  thyself  art  one  in  Person.  Wherefore, 
having  known  thee  as  one  God  with  the  Father  and  the 
Spirit  we  worship  thee  in  faith,  blessing  them. 

O  glorified  ones,  verily  ye  did  refute  Pyrrhus  Ser- 
gius,  Honorius,  Ephtechis,  Dioscorus,  with  Nestor  the 
ugly,  saving  the  flock  of  Christ  from  the  fall  of  either 
side,  proclaiming  Christ  aloud  as  dual  in  Nature  and 
one  in  Person,  manifest  in  acts  alone.  Him,  therefore, 
we  worhsip  with  the  Father  and  the  Spirit,  perfect  God 
and  perfect  Man,  and  honour  you  with  glory. 

Those  God-mantled  blessed  ones,  assembled  together, 
wisely  declared  that  the  divine  act,  the  act  of  him  who 
humbled  himself  in  our  flesh,  and  his  divine  Will  are 
uncreate,  ascribing  createdness  to  the  human  act  and 
human  will  to  escape  the  confusion  of  his  Nature  and 
the  division  of  his  Person.  Wherefore,  we  believers 
honour  them  in  annual  feasts,  glorifying  in  unison 
Christ  who  glorified  them. 

Those  God-mantled  Fathers  have  proclaimed  today 
in  concert  that  the  uncreated  Trinity  is  one  God  and 
one  Lord,  explaining  to  all  the  agreement  of  the  sim- 
plicity of  the  one  Nature  through  participation  of  the 
will,  and  the  simplicity  of  the  deed,  and  defining  all  as 
without  beginning  and  without  end.  Wherefore,  we 
glorify  them,  as  being  like  to  the  Apostles  and  teaching 
their  Gospel  to  all.

Y 


E  have  become,  O  holy  Fathers,  conscientious  keep- 
ers of  the  apostolic  traditions;  for,  having  believed 
in  the  consubstantiality  of  the  holy  Trinity  with  Ortho- 
dox opinion,  ye  did  refute  the  blasphemy  of  Arius  in 
council.  Then,  after  rebuking  Macedonies  the  com- 
batter  against  the  Spirit,  ye  destroyed  Nestor,  Kphte- 
chis,  Dioscorus,  Sabbalius,  Severus,  the  headless  one. 
Wherefore,  we  implore  you  to  seek  for  us  deliverance 
from  their  error,  and  that  our  life  be  kept  blameless  in 
faith  from  every  pollution.

the  harm  from  all  heretics,  making  us  all  worthy  to 
glorify  the  Father,  the  Word,  and  the  all-holy  Spirit. 
O  all-blameless  one,  thou  didst  give  birth  in  an  inef- 
fable manner  to  God  in  two  Natures,  two  Wills  and 
one  Person,  who  humbled  himself  by  his  own  will  unto 
crucifixion,  granting  us  the  richness  of  the  Godhead 
by  his  Resurrection  from  the  dead.

When  Elijah  of  celestial  mind  saw  that  all  the  people 
of  Israel  had  departed  from  the  Lord  God  and  were  led 
to  the  worship  of  idols,  he  was  stirred  with  zeal,  hold- 
ing back  the  clouds,  burning  the  earth  and  closing  the 
heavens  with  a  single  word,  saying,  Not  a  drop  shall  be 
on  the  earth  except  by  my  mouth.  This  is  he  who  is 
feasted  now,  who  bestoweth  on  those  who  celebrate  his 
feast  in  faith,  inefifable  grace. 

Stichos:  Thou  art  a  priest  for  ever  according  to  the 
order  of  Melchisedech. 

Thou'  didst  cleave  the  courses  of  Jordan,  O  Elijah 
the  observer  of  ineffable  mysteries.  Thou  didst  turn 
the  deceit  of  idols  into  ashes,  by  the  lightning  of  thy 
divine  sayings.  Thou  didst  rebuke  the  king  when  he 
disobeyed  the  law,  killed  the  priests  of  iniquity,  and 
burned  their  sacrifice  with  prayer.  Wherefore,  now, 
the  fires  of  thine  intercessions  extinguished  the  flames 
of  passions  and  live  coals  of  sorrows  of  thy  people.

the  order  of  Melchisedech.  Said  the  Lord  to  my  Lord, 
Sit  thou  at  my  right  hand. 

Section  from  the  Catholic  Epistle  of  St.  James 
(5:10  to  end) 
^E  brethren:  Take  for  an  example  of  suffering  evil, 
-*■    of  labour  and  patience,  the  prophets,  who  spoke  in 
the  name  of  the  Lord. 


566  Menaion 

Behold,  we  account  them  blessed  who  have  endured. 
You  have  heard  of  the  patience  of  Job,  and  you  have 
seen  the  end  of  the  Lord,  that  the  Lord  is  merciful  and 
compassionate. 

But  above  all  things,  my  brethren,  swear  not,  neither 
by  heaven,  nor  by  the  earth,  nor  by  any  other  oath.  But 
let  your  speech  be,  yea,  yea :  no,  no :  that  you  fall  not 
under  judgment. 

Is  any  of  you  sad?  Let  him  pray.  Is  he  cheerful  in 
mind?    Let  him  sing  Psalms. 

Is  any  man  sick  among  you?  Let  him  bring  in  the 
priests  of  the  church,  and  let  them  pray  over  him, 
anointing  him  with  oil  in  the  name  of  the  Lord. 

And  the  prayer  of  faith  shall  save  the  sick  man:  and 
the  Lord  shall  raise  him  up:  and  if  he  be  in  sins,  they 
shall  be  forgiven  him. 

Confess  therefore  your  sins  one  to  another :  and  pray 
one  for  another,  that  you  may  be  saved.  For  the  con- 
tinual prayer  of  a  just  man  availeth  much. 

Elias  was  a  man  passible  like  unto  us :  and  with  pray- 
er he  prayed  that  it  might  not  rain  upon  the  earth,  and 
it  rained  not  for  three  years  and  six  months. 

And  he  prayed  again :  and  the  heaven  gave  rain,  and 
the  earth  brought  forth  her  fruit. 

My  brethren,  if  any  of  you  shall  err  from  the  truth, 
and  one  convert  him: 

He  must  know  that  he  who  causeth  a  sinner  to  be  con- 
verted from  the  error  of  his  way,  shall  save  his  soul 
from  death,  and  shall  cover  a  multitude  of  sins. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (4:22-26;  28-30) 

A  T  that  time :  People  wondered  at  the  words  of  grace 
-^  that  proceeded  from  his  mouth,  and  they  said:  Is 
not  this  the  son  of  Joseph? 

And  he  said  to  them:  Doubtless  you  will  say  to  me 
this  similitude:  Physician,  heal  thyself:  as  great  things 
as  we  have  heard  done  in  Capharnaum,  do  also  here  in 
thine  own  country. 


July  20-25  567 

And  he  said:  Amen  I  say  to  you,  that  no  prophet  is 
accepted  in  his  own  country. 

In  truth  I  say  to  you,  there  were  many  widows  in  the 
days  of  Elias  in  Israel,  when  heaven  was  shut  up  three 
years  and  six  months,  when  there  was  a  great  famine 
throughout  all  the  earth. 

And  to  none  of  them  was  Elias  sent,  but  to  Sarepta 
of  Sidon,  to  a  widow  woman. 

And  all  they  in  the  synagogue,  hearing  these  things, 
were  filled  with  anger. 

And  they  rose  up  and  thrust  him  out  of  the  city;  and 
they  brought  him  to  the  brow  of  the  hill,  whereon  their 
city  was  built,  that  they  might  cast  him  down  headlong. 

But  he  passing  through  the  midst  of  them,  went  his 
way.

Betrayal ;  so  that  seeing  thy  wonders  they  might  not  be 
dismayed  at  thy  sufferings.  Make  us,  therefore,  to  wor- 
ship the  same  in  peace  for  thy  great  mercy.    {Repeat.) 

Before  thy  Crucifixon,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  take  thy 
Disciples  to  a  high  mountain  and  wast  transfigured  be- 
fore them,  illumining  them  with  rays  of  might;  being 
desirous  to  manifest  to  them  the  light  of  the  Resurrec- 
tion, on  the  one  side  through  thy  love  of  mankind, 
and  on  the  other  through  thy  might.  Wherefore,  make 
us  worthy  thereof,  O  God,  in  peace;  for  thou  art  good 
and  the  Lover  of  mankind.    {Repeat,) 

When  thou  wast  transfigured,  O  Saviour,  on  a  high 
mountain,  in  the  presence  of  thy  chief  Disciples,  thou 
didst  shine  forth  in  glory,  symbolizing  that  they  who 
are  recognized  for  the  sublimity  of  virtue,  shall  also  be 
made  worthy  of  divine  glory.  As  for  Moses  and  Elijah, 
when  they  conversed  with  Christ  they  made  manifest 
that  he  was  the  Lord  of  the  quick  and  the  dead,  and 
that  he  was  the  God  who  spake  of  old  in  the  law  and 
the  Prophets,  the  same  to  whom  the  voice  of  the  Father 
did  bear  witness  from  a  radiant  cloud,  saying,  Him  do 
ye  hear;  for  he  it  is  who  by  the  Cross  hath  taken  cap- 
tive hades  and  hath  bestowed  life  eternal  to  the  dead. 

Yea,  the  mountain  which  was  thick  with  smoke  of 
old  hath  become  now  honourable  and  holy;  for  that 
thy  feet  did  rest  on  it,  O  Lord,  for  the  mystery  hidden 
before  the  ages,  thy  Transfiguration  before  Peter, 
James,  and  John  hath  made  manifest.  And  they,  not 
being  able  to  bear  the  radiance  of  thy  face  and  the 
splendour  of  thy  raiment,  did  fall  down  on  their  faces 
kneeling,  and  being  overcome  with  astonishment,  won- 
dered at  the  sight  of  Moses  and  Elijah  conferring  with

thee  on  things  that  were  to  befall  thee,  while  a  voice 
from  the  Father  bore  witness,  saying,  This  is  my  be- 
loved Son  in  whom  I  am  well  pleased,  hear  him  who 
giveth  to  the  world  the  Great  Mercy. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone  (By  Anatolius) 

Y^HEN  thou  didst  prefigure  thy  Resurrection,  O 
Christ  God,  thou  didst  take  thy  three  Disciples, 
Peter,  James,  and  John,  and  with  them  didst  ascend 
Mount  Tabor.  And  at  thy  Transfiguraton,  O  Saviour, 
Mount  Tabor  was  covered  with  light.  As  for  thy  Disci- 
ples, they  threw  themselves  on  the  ground,  unable  to 
bear  the  sight  of  thy  figure  that  may  not  be  looked  upon, 
O  Word.  And  the  angels  did  minister  in  fear  and  awe, 
while  the  heavens  were  afiPrighted  and  the  earth  trem- 
bled when  they  beheld  on  earth  the  Lord  of  Glory. 

ilTlien  the  Eisodos,  a/id  O  resplendent  Light,  etc.;  the  daily  Pro- 
keimenons;  and  the  following  Readings. 

First  Reading :  from  Exodus  (24:12  to  end) 

AND  the  Lord  said  unto  Moses :  Come  up  to  me  into 
the  mount,  and  be  there :  and  I  will  give  thee  tables 
of  stone,  and  a  law,  and  the  commandments  which  I 
have  written;  that  thou  mayest  teach  them. 

And  Moses  rose  up,  and  his  minister  Joshua;  and 
Moses  went  up  into  the  mount  of  God. 

And  he  said  unto  the  elders,  Tarry  ye  here  for  us, 
until  we  come  again  unto  you :  and,  behold,  Aaron  and 
Hur  are  with  you :  if  any  man  have  any  matters  to  do, 
let  him  come  unto  them. 

And  Moses  went  up  into  the  mount,  and  a  cloud  cov- 
ered the  mount. 

And  the  glory  of  the  Lord  abode  upon  mount  Sinai, 
and  the  cloud  covered  it  six  days:  and  the  seventh  day 
he  called  unto  Moses  out  of  the  midst  of  the  cloud. 

And  the  sight  of  the  glory  of  the  Lord  was  like  de- 
vouring fire  on  the  top  of  the  mount  in  the  eyes  of  the 
children  of  Israel. 


572  Menaion 

And  Moses  went  into  the  midst  of  the  cloud,  and  got 
him  up  into  the  mount:  and  Moses  was  in  the  mount 
forty  days  and  forty  nights. 

Second  Reading :  from  Exodus  (33 :11  to  end; 
34:4-6,  8) 

A  ND  the  Lord  spake  unto  Moses  face  to  face,  as  a 

man  speaketh   unto   his   friend.     And   he   turned 

again  into  the  camp:  but  his  servant  Joshua,  the  son  of 

JNun,  a  young  man,  departed  not  out  of  the  tabernacle. 

And  Moses  said  unto  the  Lord,  See,  thou  sayest  unto 
me,  Bring  up  this  people:  and  thou  hast  not  let  me 
know  whom  thou  wilt  send  with  me.  Yet  thou  hast 
said,  I  know  thee  by  name,  and  thou  hast  also  found 
grace  in  my  sight. 

Now  therefore,  I  pray  thee,  if  I  have  found  grace  in 
thy  sight,  show  me  now  thy  way,  that  I  may  know  thee, 
that  I  may  find  grace  in  thy  sight:  and  consider  that  this 
nation  is  thy  people. 

And  he  said.  My  presence  shall  go  with  thee,  and  I 
will  give  thee  rest. 

And  he  said  unto  him.  If  thy  presence  go  not  with 
me,  carry  us  not  up  hence. 

For  wherein  shall  it  be  known  here  that  I  and  thy 
people  have  found  grace  in  thy  sight?  is  it  not  in  that 
thou  goest  with  us?  So  shall  we  be  separated,  I  and 
thy  people,  from  all  the  people  that  are  upon  the  face 
of  the  earth. 

And  the  Lord  said  unto  Moses,  I  will  do  this  thing 
also  that  thou  hast  spoken:  for  thou  hast  found  grace 
in  my  sight,  and  I  know  thee  by  name. 

And  he  said,  I  beseech  thee,  show  me  thy  glory. 

And  he  said,  I  will  make  all  my  goodness  pass  be- 
fore thee,  and  I  will  proclaim  the  name  of  the  Lord 
before  thee;  and  will  be  gracious  to  whom  I  will  be 
gracious,  and  will  show  mercy  on  whom  I  will  show 
mercy. 

And  he  said,  Thou  canst  not  see  my  face:  for  there 
shall  no  man  see  me,  and  live. 


August  6 — The  Transfiguration  573 

And  the  Lord  said,  Behold,  there  is  a  place  by  me, 
and  thou  shalt  stand  upon  a  rock: 

And  it  shall  come  to  pass,  while  my  glory  passeth  by, 
that  I  will  put  thee  in  a  cleft  of  the  rock,  and  will  cover 
thee  with  my  hand  while  I  pass  by: 

And  I  will  take  away  mine  hand,  and  thou  shalt  see 
my  back  parts;  but  my  face  shall  not  be  seen. 

And  Moses  rose  up  early  in  the  morning,  and  went 
up  unto  mount  Sinai,  as  the  Lord  had  commanded  him, 
and  took  in  his  hand  the  two  tables  of  stone. 

And  the  Lord  descended  in  the  cloud,  and  stood  with 
him  there,  and  proclaimed  the  name  of  the  Lord. 

And  the  Lord  passed  by  before  him,  and  proclaimed, 
The  Lord,  the  Lord  God,  merciful  and  gracious,  long- 
sufTering,  and  abundant  in  goodness  and  truth, 

And  Moses  made  haste,  and  bowed  his  head  toward 
the  earth,  and  worshipped  the  Lord. 

Third  Reading :  from  3  Kings  (19:3-16) 

AT  that  time,  Elijah  arose,  and  came  to  Beersheba, 
which  belongeth  to  Judah,  and  left  his  servant 
there. 

But  he  himself  went  a  day's  journey  into  the  wilder- 
ness, and  came  and  sat  down. 

And  slept  under  a  juniper  tree,  behold,  then  an  angel 
touched  him,  and  said  unto  him.  Arise  and  eat. 

And  he  looked,  and,  behold,  here  was  a  cake  baken 
on  the  coals,  and  a  cruse  of  water  at  his  head.  And  he 
did  eat  and  drink,  and  laid  him  down  again. 

And  the  angel  of  the  Lord  came  again  the  second 
time,  and  touched  him,  and  said.  Arise  and  eat;  be- 
cause the  journey  is  too  great  for  thee. 

And  he  arose,  and  did  eat  and  drink,  and  went  in 
the  strength  of  that  meat  forty  days  and  forty  nights 
unto  Horeb  the  mount  of  God. 

And  he  came  thither  unto  a  cave,  and  lodged  there; 
and,  behold,  the  word  of  the  Lord  came  to  him,  and  he 
said  unto  him.  What  doest  thou  here,  Elijah? 


574  Menaion 

And  he  said,  I  have  been  very  jealous  for  the  Lord 
God  of  hosts:  for  the  children  of  Israel  have  forsaken 
thy  covenant,  thrown  down  thine  altars,  and  slain  thy 
prophets  with  the  sword;  and  I,  even  I  only,  am  left; 
and  they  seek  my  life,  to  take  it  away. 

And  he  said.  Go  forth,  and  stand  upon  the  mount 
before  the  Lord.  And,  behold,  the  Lord  passed  by, 
and  a  great  and  strong  wind  rent  the  mountains,  and 
brake  in  pieces  the  rocks  before  the  Lord;  but  the  Lord 
was  not  in  the  wind;  and  after  the  wind  an  earthquake; 
but  the  Lord  was  not  in  the  earthquake: 

And  after  the  earthquake  a  fire;  but  the  Lord  was 
not  in  the  fire:  and  after  the  fire  a  still  small  voice. 

And  it  was  so,  when  Elijah  heard  it,  that  he  wrapped 
his  face  in  his  mantle,  and  went  out,  and  stood  in  the 
entering  in  of  the  cave. 

And  the  Lord  said  unto  him.  Go,  return  on  thy  way 
to  the  wilderness  of  Damascus;  and  anoint  Elisha  the 
son  of  Shaphat  prophet  instead  of  thyself. 

^And  after  the  usual  Petitions,  the  following  Litiya  is  chanted  in 
the  Fifth  Tone. 

/"^OME,  let  us  go  up  to  the  mount  of  the  Lord,  and 
^^  to  the  house  of  our  God,  to  behold  the  glory  of  his 
Transfiguration,  the  glory  as  of  an  only  Son  of  the 
Father,  receiving  light  from  his  light.  And  ascending 
by  the  Spirit,  we  praise  through  the  ages  the  consub- 
stantial  Trinity. 

^And  in  the  Aposticha,  the  following  Idiornelons  are  chanted  in 
the  First   Tone. 

TT'ERILY,  he  who  spoke  to  Moses  by  symbols  on 
Mount  Sinai  of  old,  saying,  I  am  who  I  am,  hath 
manifested  himself  today  on  Mount  Tabor  to  his  Dis- 
ciples, showing  in  himself  the  beauty  of  the  element  of 
the  first  image,  by  taking  unto  himself  human  sub- 
stance. And  he  raised  as  witness  for  this  grace,  Moses 
and  Elijah,  making  them  partakers  in  his  joy  and  pre- 
cursors of  the  Gospel  of  emancipation  through  the  Cross 
and  the  Resurrection  of  salvation. 


August  6 — The  Transfiguration  575 

Stichos:  Thine  are  the  heavens,  and  thine  is  the  earth. 

Verily,  David,  God's  sire,  when  he  foresaw  in  the 
spirit  thy  coming  to  men  in  the  flesh,  O  only  Son,  called 
creation  from  afar  to  rejoice,  shouting  prophetically, 
Tabor  and  Hermon  shall  rejoice  in  thy  Name;  for  it  is 
on  this  mount  thou  didst  ascend  with  thy  Disciples,  O 
Saviour,  and  by  thy  Transfiguration  didst  cause  the 
dark  nature  of  Adam  to  flourish,  restoring  its  element 
to  glory  and  splendour.  Wherefore,  O  All-creator,  we 
cry  out  rejoicing.  Glory  to  thee. 

Stichos:  Tabor  and  Hermon  shall  rejoice  in  thy 
Name. 

The  pre-called  Disciples,  O  Christ,  without  begin- 
ning, when  they  beheld  on  the  mount  of  Transfiguration 
the  unbearable  radiance  of  thy  light,  and  thine  unap- 
proachable Godhead,  were  overpowered  by  a  divine 
dazzlement.  And  when  they  were  illumined  by  the 
light  of  the  radiant  cloud,  they  heard  the  voice  of  the 
Father  confirming  the  mystery  of  thine  Incarnation; 
for  thou  verily  remainest  one,  even  after  the  Incarna- 
tion, thou  only  Son  and  Saviour  of  mankind. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

T^ODAY  hast  thou  manifested  on  Mount  Tabor,  O 
Lord,  the  glory  of  thy  divine  image  to  the  chosen 
of  thy  Disciples,  Peter,  James,  and  John;  for  when 
they  saw  thy  garments  glistening  as  light,  and  thy  face 
surpassing  the  sun  in  splendour,  and  they  could  no  more 
bear  to  behold  thine  unbearable  radiance,  they  fell  to 
the  ground,  utterly  unable  to  gaze  upon  it;  and  they 
heard  a  voice  from  on  high  testifying  and  saying.  This 
is  my  beloved  Son,  who  cometh  into  the  world  to  save 
man.

First  Kathisma,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

^T^HOU  hast  been  transfigured,  O  Saviour,  on  Mount 
Tabor,  indicating  the  transformation  of  mankind 
which  shall  take  place  at  thy  dreadful  Second  Coming. 
Moses  and  Elijah  did  converse  with  thee.  But  thy 
Disciples,  whom  thou  didst  call,  when  they  beheld  thy 
glory,  O  Master,  were  dazzled  by  thy  brightness. 
Wherefore,  O  thou  who  didst  at  that  time  cause  thy 
light  to  shine  on  them,  lighten  our  souls. 

Second  Kathisma,  in  the  Same  Tone 

nPHOU  hast  been  transfigured,  O  Jesus,  on  Mount 
Tabor,  and  a  brilliant  cloud  spread  out  itself  like 
a  tabernacle,  covering  the  Apostles  of  thy  glory.  They 
looked  to  the  s^^round,  unable  to  behold  the  unap- 
proachable splendour  of  the  glory  of  thy  countenance, 
O  Christ,  Saviour  and  God  without  beginning.  There- 
fore, O  thou  who  didst  cause  thy  light  to  shine  on  them, 
lighten  our  souls. 

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Same  Tone 

r\  THOU  who  didst  ascend  the  mount  with  thy  Dis- 
^^^  ciples,  and  didst  shine  in  the  glory  of  the  Father, 
Moses  and  Elijah  were  present  with  thee;  for  the  law 
and  the  Prophets  do  serve  thee  since  thou  art  God.  And 
the  Father  designated  for  thee  natural  prophetship, 
calling  thee  Son.  Wherefore,  do  we  praise  him,  with 
thee,  and  with  the  Holy  Spirit.

August  6 — The  Transfiguration  577 

Tabor  and  Hermon  shall  rejoice  in  thy  Name.  Thine 
are  the  heavens,  and  thine  is  the  earth. 

The  Matin  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (9:28-36) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  took  Peter  and  John  and  James, 
and  went  up  into  the  mountain  to  pray. 

And  as  he  prayed,  the  fashion  of  his  countenance  was 
altered,  and  his  raiment  was  white  and  glistering. 

And,  behold,  there  talked  with  him  two  men,  which 
were  Moses  and  Elias : 

Who  appeared  in  glory,  and  spake  of  his  decease 
which  he  should  accomplish  at  Jerusalem. 

But  Peter  and  they  that  were  with  him  were  heavy 
with  sleep:  and  when  they  were  awake,  they  saw  his 
glory,  and  the  two  men  that  stood  with  him. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  as  they  departed  from  him, 
Peter  said  unto  Jesus,  Master,  it  is  good  for  us  to  be 
here:  and  let  us  make  three  tabernacles;  one  for  thee, 
and  one  for  Moses,  and  one  for  Elias :  not  knowing  what 
he  said. 

While  he  thus  spake,  there  came  a  cloud,  and  over- 
shadowed them :  and  they  feared  as  they  entered  into 
the  cloud. 

And  there  came  a  voice  out  of  the  cloud,  saying,  This 
is  my  beloved  Son:  hear  him. 

And  when  the  voice  was  past,  Jesus  was  found  alone. 
And  they  kept  it  close,  and  told  no  man  in  those  days 
any  of  those  things  which  they  had  seen. 

^Then  Psalm  50  {plain  reading)   Glory,  By  the  intercession  of  the

^Then  on  O  merciful  One,  have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  the  fol- 
lowing Idiomelon,  the  Second  Tone. 

C\  THOU  holy  One  who  hast  sanctified  the  whole 

universe  by  thy  light,  thou  hast  been  transfigured 

on  a  high  mountain,  and  hast  shown  thy  Disciples  thy

gression.  Wherefore,  do  we  cry  out  to  thee,  O  compas- 
sionate Lord,  save  our  souls. 

C^Note:  The  following  Hermoses  are  chanted  as  Katabasias  from 
July  twenty-seventh  to  thirty-first,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

1.  The  hosts  of  Israel,  having  passed  the  Red  Sea 
and  watery  deep  with  feet  unmoist,  and  having  seen 
the  three-speared  riders  of  the  enemy  drowned  beneath 
the  waters,  sang  aloud  with  joy,  Let  us  praise  our  God ; 
for  he  hath  been  glorified. 

2.  The  bows  of  the  mighty  are  become  weak;  and 
the  weak  ones  are  girded  with  strength.  Therefore, 
hath  my  heart  been  made  steadfast  in  the  Lord. 

4.  O  Christ,  I  have  heard  of  thy  glorious  provi- 
dence, and  that  thou  wast  born  of  a  Virgin  to  deliver 
those  who  are  in  error,  who  cry  out  to  thee.  Glory  to 
thy  might,  O  Lord. 

5.  O  Christ,  Creator,  who  didst  separate  light  from 
primeval  darkness,  that  thy  works  might  praise  thee  in 
the  light,  guide  thou  our  feet  in  thy  light. 

6.  In  my  sorrow  I  cried  unto  the  Lord,  and  the  God 
of  my  salvation  hath  heard  me. 

7.  Verily,  the  Abrahamite  youths  did  tread  of  old 
the  flames  of  the  furnace  in  Babylon,  singing  in  praise. 
Blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

8.  When  the  youths  in  Babylon  were  kindled  by 
divine  zeal  they  trampled  bravely  upon  the  flames  and 
the  threats  of  the  violator.  And  when  they  were  cast 
into  the  midst  of  the  fire,  being  watered  with  dew,  they 
sang,  Bless  the  Lord,  all  his  works. 

^But  in  the  present  Feast,  sing  the  Katabasias  of  the  Cross  (/>.  300) , 
and  instead  of  O  thou  who  art  more  honourable,  etc.,  the  following 
Ninth  Ode  is  sung  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

9.  Thy  birth-giving,  O  Theotokos,  has  been  shown 
free  of  corruption;  for  God  did  come  forth  from  thy 
womb  cutting  on  flesh;  and  on  earth  he  did  appear,  and 
walked  among  men.  Wherefore,  thee  do  we  all  mag- 
nify. 


August  6 — The  Transfiguration  579 

Verily,  the  Disciples  when  they  were  instantly  illum- 
inated by  the  effulgence  of  created  light,  looked  at  one 
another  with  fright,  falling  on  their  faces  to  the  ground, 
and  worshipped  thee,  O  Master  of  all. 

And  the  cloud,  for  the  confirmation  of  the  miracle, 
gave  forth  a  voice  from  a  God-moved  reverberation; 
for  the  Father  of  light  did  shout  to  the  Disciples,  say- 
ing, This  is  my  beloved  Son:  hear  ye  him. 

The  servants  of  the  Word,  beholding  new  and  won- 
drous things,  and  hearing  the  fatherly  voice  on  Tabor, 
cried  out  rejoicing.  This  is  our  Saviour,  the  Element  of 
the  ancient  covenant. 

O  Word,  untransformed.  Son,  O  true  image  of  the 
Being  on  high,  and  his  unshaken  Seal,  his  Wisdom, 
Arm,  right  Hand,  and  Power,  thee  do  we  praise  with 
the  Father  and  Holy  Spirit. 

^Also  the  following  Ninth  Ode,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

A  LL  ears  were  alarmed  at  the  ineffable  condescen- 
sion of  God;  how  the  high  One  condescended  wil- 
lingly even  unto  the  flesh  and  became  man  from  the 
virginal  womb.  Therefore,  we  believers  do  magnify 
the  undefiled  Theotokos. 

That  thou  mightest,  O  Christ,  make  clear  thine  in- 
effable second  descent,  how  the  high  God  appeareth 
standing  among  the  gods,  thou  didst  shine  forth  upon 
the  Apostles  and  Moses  with  Elijah  on  Tabor,  in  an 
ineffable  manner.    Wherefore,  we  all  magnify  thee. 

Come,  all  ye  nations  and  hearken  to  me,  as  we  as- 
cend the  heavenly  holy  mountain.  Let  us  stand  in  an 
immaterial  manner  in  the  living  city  of  God,  beholding 
with  spiritual  eye  the  immaterial  Godhead,  the  God- 
head of  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  shining  forth 
in  the  unique  Son. 

Thou  hast  infatuated  me  by  thy  longing,  O  Christ, 
and  hast  transformed  me  by  thy  divine  Passion.  Burn 
thou,  therefore,  my  sins  by  an  immaterial  fire,  and  make 
me  worthy  to  be  filled  with  thy  bliss,  so  that,  rejoicing  in 
both,  I  may  magnify  thy  presence,  O  good  One.

ilAnd  conclude  with  the  Ninth  Katabasia  of  the  Cross,  Thou  art 
the  mystical  paradise,  O  Theotokos,  etc.   {302). 

r\  THOU  Word,  untransformable  Light,  the  Light 
-  of  the  unborn   Father,  by  thy  light  which  hath 
shown  today  on  Tabor,  we  have  seen  the  Father's  light 
and  the  Spirit's  light,  lighting  the  whole  creation. 

^And  in   the  Einos,   the  following  four  Prosomia,   in   the  Fourth 
Tone. 

T3EFORE  thy  precious  Crucifixion  and  thy  Passion, 
O  Master,  thou  didst  take  those  whom  thou  didst 
choose  of  thy  pure  Disciples,  and  with  them  didst  as- 
cend Mount  Tabor,  desiring  to  show  them  thy  glory. 
And  when  they  beheld  thee  transfigured  and  shining 
forth  with  a  splendour  greater  than  the  sun's,  they  fell 
down  dazzled  by  thy  might,  crying  out  to  thee,  O 
Christ,  thou  art  the  Light  without  time,  the  Radiance  of 
the  Father,  though  seen  by  thy  will  an  untransformable 
body.    {Repeat.) 

O  thou  who  before  the  ages  art  God  the  Word,  O 
thou  clothed  with  light  like  a  garment,  thou  wast  trans- 
figured before  thy  Disciples,  O  Master,  and  didst  shine 
forth  surpassing  the  sun.  Verily,  Moses  and  Elijah  did 
stand  before  thee,  clearly  showing  that  thou  art  Lord 
of  the  quick  and  the  dead,  glorifying  thine  ineffable 
providence,  thy  mercy,  and  thy  great  condescension 
wherewith  thou  didst  save  the  lost  world. 

Verily,  thou  wast  born  of  the  cloud  of  the  Virgin,  O 
Lord,  and  hast  become  flesh  and  wast  transfigured  on 
Mount  Tabor.  Then  a  bright  cloud  did  surround 
thee,  and  the  voice  of  the  Father  did  manifest  thee 
openly,  in  the  presence  of  the  Disciples,  as  a  beloved 
Son,  since  thou  art  consubstantial  with  him  and  equal  in 
rank.  Therefore,  Peter  was  astonished,  saying,  It  is 
good  for  us  to  be  here,  not  knowing  what  he  saith,  O 
Benefactor  and  abundant  of  mercy.

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

^IT'ERILY  Christ  took  Peter,  James,  and  John  to  a 
high  mountain  alone.  And  he  was  transfigured 
before  them,  his  countenance  shining  as  the  sun,  and 
his  clothes  became  white  as  light.  Moses  and  Elijah 
appeared  and  conversed  with  him,  and  a  bright  cloud 
covered  them.  Then  behold,  a  voice  from  the  cloud 
said.  This  is  my  beloved  Son  in  whom  I  am  well

O  Christ  our  God :  so  that,  when  they  should  see  thee 
crucified,  they  would  remember  that  thy  suffering  was 
voluntary,  and  could  declare  to  all  the  world  that  thou 
art  truly  the  effulgent  Splendour  of  the  Father.

582  Menaion 

Section  from  the  Second  Epistle  of  St.  Peter  (1:10-19) 

^T'E  brethren:  Labour  the  more,  that  by  good  works 
-■•  you  may  make  sure  your  calling  and  election:  for 
doing  these  things,  you  shall  not  sin  at  any  time. 

For  so  an  entrance  shall  be  ministered  to  you  abun- 
dantly into  the  everlasting  kingdom  of  our  Lord  and 
Saviour  Jesus  Christ. 

For  which  cause  I  will  begin  to  put  you  always  in 
remembrance  of  these  things :  though  indeed  you  know 
them,  and  are  confirmed  in  the  present  truth. 

But  I  think  it  meet  as  long  as  I  am  in  this  tabernacle, 
to  stir  you  up  by  putting  you  in  remembrance. 

Being  assured  that  the  laying  away  of  this  my  taber- 
nacle is  at  hand,  according  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
also  hath  signified  to  me. 

And  I  will  endeavour,  that  you  frequently  have  after 
my  decease,  whereby  you  may  keep  a  memory  of  these 
things. 

For  we  have  not  by  following  artificial  fables,  made 
known  to  you  the  power,  and  presence  of  our  Lord 
Jesus  Christ;  but  we  were  eyewitnesses  of  his  greatness. 

For  he  received  from  God  the  Father,  honour  and 
glory:  this  voice  coming  down  to  him  from  the  excel- 
lent glory:  This  is  my  beloved  Son,  in  whom  I  am  well 
pleased;  hear  ye  him. 

And  this  voice  we  heard  brought  from  heaven,  when 
we  were  with  him  in  the  holy  mount. 

And  we  have  the  more  firm  prophetical  word : 
whereunto  you  do  well  to  attend,  as  to  a  light  that 
shineth  in  a  dark  place,  until  the  day  dawn,  and  the  day 
star  arise  in  your  hearts. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (17:1-9) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  taketh  Peter,  James,  and  John 
his  brother,   and   bringeth   them  up   into   a   high 
Mountain  apart. 

And  was  transfigured  before  them:  and  his  face  did 
shine  as  the  sun,  and  his  raiment  was  white  as  the  light. 


August  6-10  583 

And  behold,  there  appeared  unto  them  Moses  and 
Elias  talking  with  him. 

Then  answered  Peter,  and  said  unto  Jesus,  Lord,  it 
is  good  for  us  to  be  here:  if  thou  wilt,  let  us  make  here 
three  tabernacles;  one  for  thee,  and  one  for  Moses,  and 
one  for  Elias. 

While  he  yet  spake,  behold,  a  bright  cloud  over- 
shadowed them:  and  behold  a  voice  out  of  the  cloud, 
which  said,  This  is  my  beloved  Son,  in  whom  I  am 
well  pleased;  hear  ye  him. 

And  when  the  disciples  heard  it,  they  fell  on  their 
face,  and  were  sore  afraid. 

And  Jesus  came  and  touched  them,  and  said,  Arise, 
and  be  not  afraid. 

And  when  they  had  lifted  up  their  eyes,  they  saw  no 
man,  save  Jesus  only. 

And  as  they  came  down  from  the  mountain,  Jesus 
charged  them,  saying,  Tell  the  vision  to  no  man,  until 
the  Son  of  man  be  risen  again  from  the  dead. 

^And  on  Especially,  smg  the  following  Hymn,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

'^TOW  hath  been  heard  that  which  had  never  been 
^^  heard  before;  for  the  Son,  who  is  from  the  Virgin 
without  father,  hath  been  testified  to  in  glory  by  the 
voice  of  the  Father;  for  he  himself  is  God  and  Man 
together  unto  the  end  of  ages.

the  world,  through  thee,  the  Great  Mercy.     {Repeat.) 

How  strange  are  thy  mysteries,  undefiled  Virgin; 
for  thou  didst  appear  as  a  throne  to  the  high  One,  and 
today  art  thou  translated  from  earth  to  heaven.  Verily, 
thy  glory  is  a  true  splendour  shining  forth  with  the

Let  us,  O  peoples,  sing  to  Christ  God  today  with  the 
song  of  David  who  saith.  The  virgins  that  follow  her

the  hands  of  her  Son  and  Master  with  surpassing  glory.

the  divine  rank  of  Apostles,  clearly  uttering  divine 
words,  praising  the  amazing  divine  mystery,  the  mys- 
tery of  the  dispensation  of  Christ  God,  and  with  joy 
preparing  thy  body  which  was  the  God-receiving  orig- 
inator of  life,  O  most  glorified  one,  while  the  most  holy 
and  honoured  angels  looked  from  one  high,  struck  with 
astonishment  and  surprise,  and  saying  one  to  another; 
Lift  ye  your  gates  and  receive  ye  the  mother  of  the 
Maker  of  heaven  and  earth.  Let  us  laud  with  songs 
of  praise  her  sanctified,  noble  body  which  contained  the

/^^ALL  out,  O  David.  What  is  this  present  feast? 
He  said;  Verily  she  whom  I  praised  in  the  Psalms 
as  daughter.  Maiden  of  God  and  Virgin,  hath  been 
translated  by  Christ,  who  was  born  of  her  without  seed, 
to  yonder  abodes.  Wherefore,  mothers,  daughters,  and 
brides  of  Christ  shout  in  joy.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  hast

Theotokos.  And  with  them  the  multitudes  of  angels 
sang,  praising  thy  solemn  assumption,  which  we  cele- 
brate in  faith. 

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Third  Tone 

A  S  for  thy  birth-giving,  it  was  with  a  seedless  con- 
ception;  and  as  for  thy  falling-asleep,  it  was  death 
without  corruption.  Lo,  a  wonder  was  joined  to  an- 
other wonder,  doubly  wonderous;  for  how  can  the  un- 
wedded  give  suck  to  a  babe  and  yet  remain  undefiled? 
Or  how  is  the  Theotokos  prepared  with  ointments  as 
one  who  is  dead?  Wherefore,  with  the  angels  do  we 
cry  to  thee.  Hail,  O  full  of  grace.

tears,  saying,  I  see  thee  clearly,  O  Virgin,  stretched  out, 
O  life  of  all,  and  am  astonished.  O  thou  undefiled  one,

glory  hath  he  been  glorified.

almighty  Power,  establish  thy  Church  without  guile,

dwellest  among  the  holy.

5.  Verily,  I  proclaim,  O  Christ,  the  divine  goodness 
of  thine  ineffable  virtues;  for  thou  didst  rise  from 
eternal  glory  as  a  ray,  coeternal  in  thy  Person,  and  wast 
incarnate  in  the  Virgin's  womb,  bringing  forth  a  sun 
to  those  who  are  in  darkness  and  error.

6.  Verily,  the  fire  in  the  vitals  of  the  deep-born

Jonah  was  an  exemplar;  for  having  escaped  without 
hurt  when  he  was  swallowed,  he  shouted,  saying,  I  will 
sacrifice  unto  thee  with  the  voice  of  thanksgiving,  O

7.  Verily,  the  divine  passion  did  defeat  the  bestial 
wrath  and  fire,  moistening  the  fire,  and  with  inspired

righteous  ones,  scorning  wrath,  opposing  the  musical 
instruments,  as  they  sang  in  the  midst  of  the  flames, 
shouting.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  glorified  One,  the  God  of 
our  Fathers. 

8.  Verily,  the  angel  of  the  Almighty  God  did  reveal 
the  flames  moistening  the  three  righteous  youths  and 
burning  the  infidels.  And  he  made  the  Theotokos  a 
fountain  for  the  Element  of  life.  Destroyer  of  death, 
and  overflowing  with  life  to  those  who  sing,  We  who 
are  saved  praise  the  Creator  alone,  ever  exalting  him  to

Magnification:  All  generations  bless  thee,  O  thou 
only  Theotokos. 

9.  In  thee,  O  spotless  Virgin,  the  laws  of  nature  were 
suspended ;  for  thy  virginity  was  preserved  in  thy  child- 
bearing,  and  Life  is  joined  with  death.  Thou,  O  Theo- 
tokos, didst  remain  a  Virgin  after  child-birth,  and  after 
death  art  still  alive  and  dost  ever  deliver  thy  heritage. 

The  angelic  powers  were  dazzled  when  they  beheld 
in  Zion  their  own  Master  holding  in  his  hands  a  fem- 
inine soul;  for  he  addressed  as  befitting  a  son  the  one 
who  immaculately  gave  him  birth  saying,  Come,  thou 
pure  one,  and  be  glorified  with  thy  Son  and  God. 

Verily,  the  ranks  of  the  Apostles  did  bury  thy  God- 
bearing  body,   beholding   it   reverently,   and   shouting

(By  John  of  Damascus) 

Verily,  the  angels,  vs^hen  they  beheld  the  falling- 
asleep  of  the  all-pure  Virgin,  were  taken  by  surprise 
that  she  ascendeth  from  the  earth  to  the  highest.

undefiled,  most  blessed  and  ever-virgin  Theotokos. 

Come,  let  us  rejoice  in  Zion,  the  divine  and  fertile 
hill  of  the  living  God,  beholding  the  Theotokos;  for 
Christ  hath  translated  her  to  the  most  worthy  and  divine 
abode,  in  the  Holy  of  Holies;  for  she  is  his  Mother. 

Come,  ye  believers,  let  us  approach  the  tomb  of  the 
Theotokos,  kissing  it  with  our  lips,  hearts,  eyes,  and 
brow,  touching  it  meekly,  receiving  from  the  ever-flow- 
ing fount  precious  gifts  of  healing. 

O  Mother  of  the  living  God,  accept  from  us  our  fare- 
well praise,  and  cover  us  with  thy  light-giving  divine 
grace,  granting  victory  to  the  king  and  peace  to  thy

out  in  joy,  singing  to  thee  the  funeral  song,  O  Mother 
of  the  Lord  of  all,  thou  who  hast  delivered  human  kind 
from  its  ancestral  condemnation. 

The  first-called  of  the  Apostles  did  hasten  from  the 
regions  by  divine  sign  to  lay  thee  away.  And  when  they 
saw  thee  ascending  from  earth  to  heaven  they  shouted 
to  thee  in  the  tone  of  Gabriel,  saying  with  joy,  Hail,  O

birth-giving  alone  didst  unite  the  earthly  with  the 
heavenly  ones. 

O  bride  of  God,  the  virgin  Mother,  who  didst  give

and  offered  on  a  charger,  as  food  for  those  reclining. 
What  a  loathsome  banquet,  replete  with  wickedness 
and  horrible  murder.  As  for  us,  we  bless  the  Baptizer, 
honouring  him  as  is  meet;  for  he  is  the  greatest  born 
of  women.    {Repeat.) 

Verily,  the  disciple  of  the  all-evil  Satan  did  dance 
and  remove  thy  head,  O  Forerunner,  as  a  hire.    What 
a  bloody  banquet;  and  would  that  thou  hadst  not  made 
that  vow,  O  iniquitous  Herod,  offspring  of  a  lie.    And 
since  thou  didst  make  the  vow,  would  that  thou  hadst 
not  carried  it  out;  for  it  were  better  to  have  foresworn 
thyself  and  receive  life,  than  remaining  true  to  thine 
oath  to  have  cut  ofif  the  head  of  the  Forerunner.     As 
for  us,  let  us  bless  the  Baptizer,  honouring  him  as  is 
meet;  for  he  is  the  greatest  born  of  women.    {Repeat.) 
It  was  not  worthy  of  thee,  O  Herod,  to  condemn  to 
death,  because  of  a  satanic  passion,  him  who  reproached 
thee  for  thine  adultery,  and  the  folly  of  thy  feminine 
propensity.    Nay,  it  was  not  worthy  of  thee  to  err  and 
deliver  his  all-honoured  head  to  a  transgressing  woman 
for  the  sake  of  a  vow  made  to  a  dancer.    Woe  to  thee, 
how  didst  thou  dare  accomplish  such  murder!     And 
how  was  it  that  this  adulterous  dancer  was  not  con- 
sumed by  fire  in  the  midst  of  the  banquet  as  she  carried 
the  head  on  a  charger?    As  for  us,  let  us  bless  the  Bap- 
tizer, honouring  him  as  is  meet;  for  he  is  the  greatest 
born  of  women. 

Yea,  again  Herodias  hath  lost  her  self-control;  again 
she  is  perturbed!  What  deceiving  dance,  and  what  in- 
toxication with  cunning!  For  the  Forerunner's  head 
was  cut  ofif,  and  Herod  is  troubled.  Wherefore,  O  Lord, 
by  the  intercessions  of  thy  Forerunner,  grant  peace  to 
our  souls.

By  John  of  Damascus 

IX/^HEN  Herod  wished  to  free  himself  from  the 
'  rebuke  of  his  iniquitious  acts,  he  delivered  unjustly 
thy  head,  O  Forerunner,  to  a  transgressing  woman.  Nor 
did  this  wretched  one  realize  that  offering  it  in  a  charg- 
er was  ignominy  for  him.  Wherefore,  since  thou  art 
a  practical  teacher  of  purity,  and  a  saving  guide  to 
repentance,  O  Baptizer,  implore  thou  Christ,  to  deliver 
us  from  the  humiliation  of  passions. 

C^And  in   the  Aposticha,   the  following  Idiomelons  are   chanted  in 
the  Second  Tone. 

r\  JOHN  the  Baptizer  and  preacher  of  repentance, 
thou  didst  sanctify  the  earth  when  thy  head  was 
cut  ofif;  for  thou  didst  make  plain  to  believers  the  law 
of  God,  abolishing  disobedience  to  the  law.  Where- 
fore, since  thou  standest  by  the  throne  of  Christ,  the 
heavenly  King,  beseech  him  to  have  mercy  on  our  souls. 

Stichos:    The  just  shall  flourish  like  the  palm-tree. 

O  most  holy  John,  thy  head  was  cut  ofif  for  the  law  of 
the  Lord ;  for  in  blameless  privilege  thou  didst  reproach 
the  infidel  king  when  he  disobeyed  the  law.  Where- 
fore, do  the  hosts  of  angels  wonder  at  thee,  and  the 
ranks  of  Apostles  and  Martyrs  praise  thee.  And  we, 
too,  honour  thy  yearly  memorial,  O  most  noble  one, 
glorifying  the  holy  Trinity  which  hath  crowned  thee, 
O  blessed  Forerunner. 

Stichos:   The  just  shall  rejoice  in  the  Lord. 

Verily,  the  Prophet  of  Prophets,  he  who  became 
greater  than  the  Prophets,  sanctified  from  his  mother's 
womb  for  the  service  of  the  Lord,  today  had  his  head 
cut  off  by  an  evil  king.  And  the  maiden  who  danced  in- 
solently, he  rebuked  openly  before  his  beheading  and 
after  it,  thus  shaming  the  procession  of  sin.  Wherefore, 
we  shout,  O  John  the  Baptizer,  having  acquired  favour, 
beseech  ceaselessly  for  our  souls.

nPHOU  didst  rebuke  kings,  O  Forerunner  of  the 
Saviour,  that  they  might  not  act  contrary  to  the 
law.  But  the  frolicking  of  an  iniquitous  woman  won 
over  Herod  to  cut  off  thy  head.  Therefore,  is  thy  name 
praised  from  the  place  of  rising  to  the  place  of  setting 
of  the  sun.  And  since  thou  hast  favour  with  the  Lord,

For  Herod  had  apprehended  John  and  bound  him, 
and  put  him  into  prison,  because  of  Herodias,  his 
brother's  wife. 

For  John  said  to  him:  It  is  not  lawful  for  thee  to 
have  her. 

And  having  a  mind  to  put  him  to  death,  he  feared 
the  people :  because  they  esteemed  him  as  a  prophet. 

But  on  Herod's  birthday,  the  daughter  of  Herodias 
danced  before  them:  and  pleased  Herod. 

Whereupon  he  promised  with  an  oath,  to  give  her 
whatsoever  she  would  ask  of  him. 

But  she  being  instructed  before  by  her  mother,  said: 
Give  me  here  in  a  dish  the  head  of  John  the  Baptist. 

And  the  king  was  struck  sad :  yet  because  of  his  oath, 
and  for  them  that  sat  with  him  at  table,  he  commanded 
it  to  be  given. 

And  he  sent,  and  beheaded  John  in  the  prison. 

And  his  head  was  brought  in  a  dish :  and  it  was  given 
to  the  damsel,  and  she  brought  it  to  her  mother. 

And  his  disciples  came  and  took  the  body,  and  buried 
it,  and  came  and  told  Jesus. 

Which  when  Jesus  had  heard,  he  retired  from  thence 
by  a  boat,  into  a  desert  place  apart,  and  the  multitudes 
having  heard  of  it,  followed  him  on  foot  out  of  the

X-IOW  strange  a  wonder!  The  noble  head,  respected 
of  angels  and  reproaching  the  law-transgressing 
tongue,  a  dancing,  adulterous  maid  did  carry  and  offer 
to  her  immoral  mother.  Ah!  for  thy  surpassing  for- 
bearance, O  Christ,  Lover  of  mankind,  through  it  save 
our  souls;  for  thou  alone  art  compassionate.    {Repeat.) 

Ah!  for  the  seduction  of  Herod,  who,  disgracing  God 
by  his  disobedience  of  the  law,  pretended  deceitfully 
and  cunningly  to  keep  his  oath,  adding  murder  to  adul- 
tery, and  affecting  a  frown.  Ah!  for  thy  surpassing 
compassion,  Christ  Lord.  Through  it  deliver  our  souls; 
for  thou  alone  art  compassionate. 

What  an  astonishing  thing,  surpassing  the  mind,  that 
the  seal  of  the  Prophets  and  the  earthly  angel  was  of- 
fered as  a  prize  for  an  immoral  dance.  And  the  tongue 
constantly  speaking  of  God  precedeth  and  is  sent  to 
preach  Christ  to  those  who  are  in  hades.  Ah!  for  thy 
surpassing  providence,  Christ  Master.  Through  it  save 
our  souls;  for  thou  alone  art  compassionate.

Saint  of  the  church;  and  the  following  Kontakion,  in  the  Fifth  Tone. 

^  I  ^HE  beheading  of  the  glorious  Forerunner  was  by 
divine  providence,  that  the  coming  of  the  Saviour 
might  be  preached  to  those  in  hades.  Let  Herodias, 
therefore,  mourn,  she  who  sought  unlawful  murder; 
for  she  hath  not  affected  the  law  of  God,  nor  hath  she 
sought  eternal  life,  preferring  the  worldly  one. 

The  Epistle:  The  just  shall  rejoice  in  the  Lord. 
Hear,  O  God,  my  voice. 

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Holy  and  Pure  Apostles 

(13:25-33) 

TN  those  days,  when  John  fulfilled  his  course,  he  said: 
I  am  not  he,  whom  you  think  me  to  be;  but  behold, 
there  cometh  one  after  me,  whose  shoes  of  his  feet  I 
am  not  worthy  to  loose. 

Men,  brethren,  children  of  the  stock  of  Abraham,  and 
whosoever  among  you  fear  God,  to  you  the  word  of  this 
salvation  is  sent. 

For  they  that  inhabited  Jerusalem,  and  the  rulers 
thereof,  not  knowing  him,  nor  the  voices  of  the  proph- 
ets, which  are  read  every  sabbath,  judging  him  have  ful- 
filled them. 

And  finding  no  cause  of  death  in  him,  they  desired 
of  Pilate,  that  they  might  kill  him. 

And  when  they  had  fulfilled  all  things  that  were 
written  of  him,  taking  him  down  from  the  tree,  they 
laid  him  in  a  sepulchre. 

But  God  raised  him  up  from  the  dead  the  third  day. 

Who  was  seen  for  many  days,  by  them  who  went 
up  with  him  from  Galilee  to  Jerusalem,  who  to  this 
present  are  his  witnesses  to  the  people. 

And  we  declare  unto  you,  that  the  promise  which 
was  made  to  our  fathers, 

This  same  God  hath  fulfilled  to  our  children,  rais- 
ing up  Jesus. 


602  Menaion 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (6:14-30) 

And  others  said:  It  is  Elias.  But  others  said:  It  is  a 
prophet,  as  one  of  the  prophets. 

Which  Herod  hearing,  said :  John  whom  I  beheaded, 
he  is  risen  again  from  the  dead. 

For  Herod  himself  had  sent  and  apprehended  John, 
and  bound  him  in  prison  for  the  sake  of  Herodias  the 
wife  of  Philip  his  brother,  because  he  had  married  her. 

For  John  said  to  Herod :  It  is  not  lawful  for  thee  to 
have  thy  brother's  wife. 

Now  Herodias  laid  snares  for  him:  and  was  desirous 
to  put  him  to  death,  and  could  not. 

For  Herod  feared  John,  knowing  him  to  be  a  just 
and  holy  man:  and  kept  him,  and  when  he  heard  him, 
did  many  things:  and  he  heard  him  willingly. 

And  when  a  convenient  day  was  come,  Herod  made 
a  supper  for  his  birthday,  for  the  princes,  and  tribunes, 
and  chief  men  of  Galilee. 

And  when  the  daughter  of  the  same  Herodias  had 
come  in,  and  had  danced,  and  pleased  Herod,  and  them 
that  were  at  table  with  him,  the  king  said  to  the  damsel : 
Ask  of  me  what  thou  wilt,  and  I  will  give  it  thee. 

And  he  swore  to  her:  Whatsoever  thou  shalt  ask  I 
will  give  thee,  though  it  be  the  half  of  my  kingdom. 

Who  when  she  was  gone  out,  said  to  her  mother. 
What  shall  I  ask?  But  she  said :  The  head  of  John  the 
Baptist. 

And  when  she  was  come  in  immediately  with  haste 
to  the  king,  she  asked,  saying:  I  will  that  forthwith  thou 
give  me  in  a  dish,  the  head  of  John  the  Baptist. 

And  the  king  was  struck  sad.  Yet  because  of  his 
oath,  and  because  of  them  that  were  with  him  at  table, 
he  would  not  displease  her: 

But  sending  an  executioner,  he  commanded  that  his 
head  should  be  brought  in  a  dish. 

And  he  beheaded  him  in  the  prison,  and  brought  his 
head  in  a  dish :  and  gave  it  to  the  damsel,  and  the  dam- 
sel gave  it  to  her  mother. 


August  29-31  603 

Which  his  disciples  hearing,  came,  and  took  his  body, 
and  laid  it  in  a  tomb. 

And  the  apostles  coming  together  unto  Jesus,  related 
to  him  all  things  that  they  had  done  and  taught. 

AT  that  time:  King  Herod  (for  his  name  was  made 
manifest)  heard  of  Jesus,  and  said,  John  the  Bap- 
tist is  risen  again  from  the  dead;  and  therefore  mighty 
works  show  forth  themselves  in  him.

FARE  SUNDAY 

Sunday  of  the  Pharisee  and  the  Publican 

ilDurinff  this  week  it  is  permitted  to  eat  meat. 

1.   Vespers 

jCOtz  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  seven  for  the  Resurrection,  in 
the  Tone  in  use;  and  three  for  the  following  Triodion,  in  the  First 
Tone. 

T  ET  us  not  pray,  brethren,  Pharisee-like;  for  he  who 
exalteth  himself  shall  be  abased.  Wherefore,  let 
us  humble  ourselves  before  God,  crying  by  means  of 
fasting,  with  the  voice  of  the  publican,  saying,  God 
forgive  us  sinners.     (Repeat.) 

When  the  Pharisee  went  down  with  empty  glory, 
and  the  publican  bowed  himself  in  repentance,  they 
came  to  thee  alone,  O  Master.  But  the  one  through 
boasting  lost  his  reward,  and  the  other  by  his  silence 
deserved  gifts.  Wherefore,  by  those  sighs  confirm  me, 
O  Christ  God,  since  thou  art  the  Lover  of  mankind. 


Pharisee  and  Publican  605 

Glory,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

A  LMIGHTY  Lord,  I  have  known  how  effective  are 
tears;  for  they  snatched  Hezekiah  from  the  doors 
of  death,  and  saved  the  sinning  woman  from  her  chronic 
iniquities.  And  as  for  the  publican  they  justified  him 
more  than  the  Pharisee.  Wherefore,  I  implore  thee  to 
number  me  among  them,  and  have  mercy  upon  me. 

^And  Now  to  our  Lady,  in  the  Tone  in  use;  the  Aposticha  for  the 
Resurrection;  and  Glory,  in  the  Fifth  Tone. 

Mine  eyes  being  weighed  down  because  of  mine  in- 
iquities, I  am  unable  to  gaze  at  the  horizon  of  heaven. 
But  thou,  O  Saviour,  accept  me  penitent  as  the  pub- 
lican. 

^And  Now  to  our  Lady,  in  the  Same  Tone.  Then  the  Troparion  for 
the  Resurrection  and  our  Lady;  and  the  Benediction. 

2.   Matins 

^On  God  the  Lord  hath  appeared  unto  us  the  Troparia;  Kathis- 
mata;  Blessings  {Eulogetcria) ;  Anabathmoi  for  the  Resurrection; 
and  the  Katabasias  for  the  Presentation.  And  if  the  Leave-Taking  of 
the  Presentation  is'  past,  the  following  Katabasias  are  sung  in  the 
Sixth  Tone. 

1.  When  Israel  walked  on  foot  at  the  bottom  of  the 
sea  as  on  dry  land,  and  beheld  Pharaoh  the  persecutor 
drowned,  they  shouted.  Let  us  praise  our  God;  for  he 
hath  triumphed. 

3.  There  is  none  holy  like  thee,  O  Lord  my  God, 
who  didst  exalt  the  horn  of  those  who  believe  in  thee, 
O  good  One,  and  established  them  on  the  rock  of  thy 
confession. 

4.  The  venerable  Church  raiseth  her  voice  in  song, 
as  is  meet  to  God,  celebrating  to  the  Lord  with  a  pure 
conscience.    Christ  is  my  might,  my  Lord,  and  my  God. 

5.  O  good  One,  lighten  with  thy  divine  light  the 
souls  of  those  who  come  to  thee  early  and  eagerly  that 
they  may  know  thee,  O  Word  of  God,  the  true  God, 
who  callest  us  from  the  darkness  of  iniquities. 


606  Triodion 

6.  O  most  merciful  One,  when  I  saw  the  sea  of  this 
life  agitated  with  the  tumult  of  temptations,  I  hastened 
to  thy  quiet  haven,  crying,  Raise  my  life  from  corrup- 
tion. 

7.  Verily,  the  angel  made  the  furnace  overflow  with 
dew  for  the  righteous  youth,  burning  the  Chaldeans  by 
the  command  of  God,  and  constraining  the  usurper  to 
shout,  crying,  Blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

8.  Thou  didst  spring  forth  from  the  flames  as  dew 
for  those  righteous  ones,  and  with  water  thou  didst  con- 
sume the  sacrifice  of  the  righteous  one;  for  thou  doest 
all  things  by  thy  mere  will.  Wherefore,  we  exalt  thee 
still  more  to  the  end  of  ages. 

9.  Verily,  the  God  whom  no  man  can  see,  nor  the 
ranks  of  angels  dare  look  upon,  through  thee,  O  pure 
one,  was  seen  among  men  as  incarnate  Word.  Where- 
fore, with  the  heavenly  hosts,  we  magnify  him,  and 
thee  do  we  bless. 

C^Jnd  after  the  Gospel  of  the  Eothina,  and  In  that  we  have  beheld 
the  Resurrection  of  Christ,  etc.,  and  Psalm  50,  sing  in  the  Eighth 
Tone: 

Glory  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit. 

/^PEN  to  me  the  doors  of  repentance,  O  Life-giver; 
^^^  for  my  soul  goeth  early  to  the  temple  of  thy  holi- 
ness, coming  in  the  temple  of  my  body,  wholly  polluted. 
But  because  thou  art  compassionate,  purify  me  by  the 
compassion  of  thy  mercies. 

Now  and  ever,  and  unto  ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

Prepare  for  me  the  ways  of  salvation,  O  Theotokos; 
for  I  have  profaned  myself  with  coarse  sins,  and  con- 
sumed my  whole  life  with  procrastination.  But  by 
thine  intercessions  purify  thou  me  from  all  abomina- 
tion. 

ilAnd  on,  O  merciful  One,  have  mercy  on  me,  O  God,  etc.,  the 
following  Idiomelon,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 


Pharisee  and  Publican  607 


I 


F  I  think  upon  the  multitude  of  my  evil  deeds,  I 
tremble  for  the  terrible  Day  of  Judgment.  But, 
trusting  the  compassion  of  thy  mercy,  I  shout  to  thee 
like  David,  Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  according 
to  thy  Great  Mercy/ 

^Then  sing,  O  thou  who  art  more  honourable  than  the  cherubim, 
etc;  and  after  that  the  Exaposteilarions  for  the  following  for  the 
Triodion. 

T  ET  us  run  away  from  the  evil  vaunting  of  the  Phar- 
isee, and  learn  the  true  humility  of  the  publican, 
that  we  may  ascend  crying  to  God  with  him.  Forgive 
us  thy  servants,  O  Christ  Saviour,  who  wast  born  of  the 
Virgin  and  willingly  bore  the  Cross  for  our  sakes,  and 
with  him  raised  the  world  by  his  divine  might. 

O  all-praised  Theotokos,  the  Author  of  creation  and 
the  God  of  all  hath  taken  a  human  body  from  thine 
undefiled  belly,  wholly  renewing  my  rotting  nature, 
leaving  thee  after  birth  as  thou  hadst  been.  Wherefore, 
we  all  praise  thee  in  faith,  shouting.  Rejoice,  O  glory  of 
the  world. 

ilAnd  in  the  Einos,  five  for  the  Resurrection;  and  three  for  the  fol- 
lowing Triodion,  in  the  Third  Tone. 

LJAVING  known,  O  my  soul,  the  difiference  between 
the  Pharisee  and  the  publican,  loathe  thou  the  tone 
of  that  braggart,  and  emulate  this  one's  prayer  of  true 
reverence,  crying,  God  be  merciful  to  me,  a  sinner,  and 
forgive  me.     {Repeat,) 

Let  us  eschew,  O  believers,  the  boastful  tone  of  the 
Pharisee,  and  emulate  the  prayer  of  the  publican  in 
true  reverence.  Let  us  not  be  exalted  in  our  own 
thoughts,  but  humble  ourselves  and  cry  contritely,  God 
forgive  us  our  sins. 


1  These  three  reverential  Troparia  are  sung  every  Sunday,  from  the  Sun- 
day of  the  Pharisee  and  the  Publican  to  the  Fifth  Sunday  of  the  Great  Fast,

ing forgiveness  with  sighs ;  for  thou  dost  not  draw  near 
to  arrogrant  thoughts,  nor  turn  away  contrite  hearts. 
Wherefore,  we  also  kneel  before  thee  meekly,  O  thou 
who  didst  suffer  for  our  sakes.  Grant  us  forgiveness 
and  the  Great  Mercy. 

^And  Now,  Thou  hast  transcended,  etc;  then  the  Great  Doxology;

chant  the  following  Kontakion,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

T   ET  us  run  away  from  the  words  of  the  boastful 
Pharisee,  and  learn  the  humility  of  the  publican, 
crying  with  sighs  to  the  Saviour,  Have  mercy  upon  us, 
O  thou  alone  of  true  reconciliation.

endured:  but  out  of  them  all  the  Lord  delivered  me. 

Yea,  and  all  that  will  live  godly  in  Christ  Jesus

Pharisee  and  Publican  609 

But  continue  thou  in  the  things  which  thou  hast 
learned  and  hast  been  assured  of,  knowing  of  whom 
thou  hast  learned  them. 

And  that  from  a  child  thou  hast  known  the  holy 
scriptures,  which  are  able  to  make  thee  wise  unto  salva- 
tion through  faith  which  is  in  Christ  Jesus. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (18:10-14) 

nPHE  Lord  saith.  This  is  a  parable:  Two  men  went 
up  into  the  temple  to  pray;  the  one  a  Pharisee,  and 
the  other  a  publican. 

The  Pharisee  stood  and  prayed  thus  with  himself, 
God,  I  thank  thee,  that  I  am  not  as  other  men  are, 
extortioners,  unjust,  adulterers,  or  even  as  this  publican. 

I  fast  twice  in  the  week,  I  give  tithes  of  all  that  I 
possess. 

And  the  publican,  standing  afar  off,  would  not  lift 
up  so  much  as  his  eyes  unto  heaven,  but  smote  upon  his 
breast,  saying,  God  be  merciful  to  me  a  sinner. 

I  tell  you,  this  man  went  down  to  his  house  justified 
rather  than  the  other:  for  everyone  that  exalteth  him- 
self shall  be  abased;  and  he  that  humbleth  himself  shall 
be  exalted. 

^And  the  rest  of  the  Liturgy  of  John  Chrysostom.

'  I  ^HE  Pharisees  were  an  old  and  famous  sect  among 
the  Jews.  Being  wicked  hypocrites,  the  Pharisees 
hid  their  vices  while  hypocritically  simulating  every 
virtue,  doing  all  their  work  to  be  seen  by  men  (St.  Matt. 
23:5).  Thus  people  imagined  them  to  be  virtuous,  as 
they  themselves  were  separated  from  the  people,  as 
their  name  implies,  pretending  holiness  and  piety  in 
their  daily  life.  The  publicans,  on  the  other  hand,  were 
tax-farmers.  And,  since  in  the  course  of  collecting 
taxes  they  were  moved  by  avarice  and  greed  to  oppress 
the  people,  they  were  considered  sinners  and  oppressors. 
In  the  parable  he  told,  Christ  used  a  Pharisee  who  was 
regarded  by  public  opinion  as  virtuous,  and  a  publican 
who  was  regarded  as  a  sinner,  thus  teaching  us  the 
harm  that  comes  from  pride  and  the  good  that  comes 
from  humility. 

The  divine  Fathers,  realizing  that  after  three  weeks 
we  shall  enter  the  field  of  Quadragesima  and  of  the 
spiritual  contests  of  virtues,  and  that  humility  is  the 
most  efficient  weapon  for  winning  virtue,  as  pride  is 
the  greatest  obstacle  thereto,  saw  fit  to  consider  the 
above  mentioned  weeks  as  a  prelude  to  participation  in 
those  contests.  And  for  this  reason  they  called  this 
week  prophonisimon,  meaning  a  herald^  as  though  it 
preceded  and  proclaimed  the  approach  of  the  time  of 
fasting.  They  also  decreed  that  the  parable  of  the 
Pharisee  and  the  Publican  be  read  during  this  week, 
intending  thereby  to  teach  us  not  to  pride  ourselves  in 
self-satisfaction,  nor  boast  and  exaggerate  as  the  proud 
Pharisee,  but  rather  take  him  as  an  example  proving  to 
us  that  the  smoke  of  pride  and  the  rottenness  of  boast- 
ing drive  away  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  stripping 
man  of  every  virtue  and  throwing  him  into  the  abyss  of 


The  Prodigal  Son  611 

hell;  also  that  we  beseech  God  with  awed  hearts,  imi- 
tating the  humility  of  the  publican  through  which  man 
is  justified  and  by  which  he  may  ascend  to  sublime 
heights  however  low  he  has  fallen  in  sin. 

Through  the  intercession  of  the  wonder-working 
saints,  O  Christ  our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us  and  save 
us.    Amen.

CO//  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  seven  of  the  Resurrection;  und 
the  followi?ig  three  for  the"  Triodion,  in  the  First  Tone. 

T  HAVE  been  entrusted  with  a  verdant  and  faultless 
region,  but  I  planted  evil  in  its  soil  and  reaped  its 
ears  with  the  scythe  of  laziness.  And  I  gathered  my 
deeds  into  sheaves  but  placed  them  not  on  the  threshing- 
floor  of  repentance.  Wherefore,  I  ask  thee,  O  divine 
Husbandman,  to  winnow  the  straw  of  my  deeds  with 
the  breeze  of  thy  compassionate  love;  and  fill  my  soul 
with  the  wheat  of  forgiveness.  Store  me  in  thy  heaven-

Our  way,  O  brethren,  is -to  know  the  power  of  this 
mystery;  for  when  the  prodigal  son  ran  away  from  sin, 
hastening  to  that  fatherly  refuge,  his  all-good  father 
welcomed  him  and  kissed  him,  granting  him  signs  of 
glory.  He  celebrated  the  mystical  joy  to  the  celestial 
ones  when  he  killed  the  fatted  calf,  that  we  might  con- 
duct ourselves  becomingly  towards  the  Sacrificer,  the 
Father  and  Lover  of  mankind,  and  to  the  sacrificed 
One,  the  glorious  Saviour  of  our  souls.

The  Prodigal  Son  615 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (6:12  to  end) 

^T'E  brethren:  All  things  are  lawful  unto  me,  but  all 

things  are  not  expedient:  all  things  are  lawful  for 

me,  but  I  will  not  be  brought  under  the  power  of  any. 

Meats  for  the  belly,  and  the  belly  for  meats:  but 
God  shall  destroy  both  it  and  them.  Now  the  body  is 
not  for  fornication,  but  for  the  Lord;  and  the  Lord  for 
the  body. 

And  God  hath  both  raised  up  the  Lord,  and  will  also 
raise  up  us  by  his  own  power. 

Know  ye  not  that  your  bodies  are  the  members  of 
Christ?  shall  I  then  take  the  members  of  Christ,  and 
make  them  the  members  of  an  harlot?    God  forbid. 

What!  know  ye  not  that  he  which  is  joined  to  an  har- 
lot is  one  body?  for  two,  saith  he,  shall  be  one  flesh. 

But  he  that  is  joined  unto  the  Lord  is  one  spirit. 

Flee  fornication.  Every  sin  that  a  man  doeth  is  with- 
out the  body;  but  he  that  committeth  fornication  sin- 
neth  against  his  own  body. 

What!  know  ye  not  that  your  body  is  the  temple  of 
the  Holy  Spirit  which  is  in  you,  which  ye  have  of 
God,  and  ye  are  not  your  own? 

For  ye  are  bought  with  a  price:  therefore  glorify 
God  in  your  body,  and  in  your  spirit,  which  are  God's. 

The  Gospel:  from  Si.  Luke  (15:11  to  end) 

T^HE  Lord  saith.  This  is  a  parable:  A  certain  man 
had  two  sons: 

And  the  younger  of  them  said  to  his  father.  Father, 
give  me  the  portion  of  goods  that  falleth  to  me.  And  he 
divided  unto  them  his  living. 

And  not  many  days  after  the  younger  son  gathered 
all  together,  and  took  his  journey  into  a  far  country, 
and  there  wasted  his  substance  with  riotous  living. 

And  when  he  had  spent  all,  there  arose  a  mighty 
famine  in  that  land;  and  he  began  to  be  in  want. 


616  Triodion 

And  he  went  and  joined  himself  to  a  citizen  of  that 
country;  and  he  sent  him  into  his  fields  to  feed  swine. 

And  he  would  fain  have  filled  his  belly  with  the  husks 
that  the  swine  did  eat;  and  no  man  gave  unto  him. 

And  when  he  came  to  himself,  he  said,  How  many 
hired  servants  of  my  father's  have  bread  enough  and  to 
spare,  and  I  perish  with  hunger! 

I  will  arise  and  go  to  my  father,  and  will  say  unto 
him.  Father,  I  have  sinned  against  heaven,  and  before 
thee, 

And  am  no  more  worthy  to  be  called  thy  son:  make 
me  as  one  of  thy  hired  servants. 

And  he  arose,  and  came  to  his  father.  But  when  he 
was  yet  a  great  way  off,  his  father  saw  him,  and  had 
compassion,  and  ran,  and  fell  on  his  neck,  and  kissed 
him. 

And  the  son  said  unto  him.  Father,  I  have  sinned 
against  heaven,  and  in  thy  sight,  and  am  no  more  worthy 
to  be  called  thy  son. 

But  the  father  said  to  his  servants.  Bring  forth  the 
best  robe,  and  put  it  on  him;  and  put  a  ring  on  his  hand, 
and  shoes  on  his  feet: 

And  bring  hither  the  fatted  calf,  and  kill  it;  and  let 
us  eat,  and  be  merry: 

For  this  my  son  was  dead,  and  is  alive  again;  he  was 
lost,  and  is  found.     And  they  began  to  be  merry. 

Now  his  elder  son  was  in  the  field :  and  as  he  came 
and  drew  nigh  to  the  house,  he  heard  music  and 
dancing. 

And  he  called  one  of  the  servants,  and  asked  what 
these  things  meant. 

And  he  said  unto  him.  Thy  brother  is  come;  and  thy 
father  hath  killed  the  fatted  calf,  because  he  hath  re- 
ceived him  safe  and  sound. 

And  he  was  angry,  and  would  not  go  in:  therefore 
came  his  father  out,  and  entreated  him. 

And  he  answering  said  to  his  father,  Lo,  these  many 
years  do  I  serve  thee,  neither  transgressed  I  at  any  time 


The  Prodigal  Son  617 

thy  commandment;  and  yet  thou  never  gavest  me  a  kid, 
that  I  might  make  merry  with  my  friends: 

But  as  soon  as  this  thy  son  was  come,  which  hath 
devoured  thy  living  with  harlots,  thou  hast  killed  for 
him  the  fatted  calf. 

And  he  said  unto  him,  Son,  thou  art  ever  with  me, 
and  all  that  I  have  is  thine. 

It  was  meet  that  we  should  make  merry,  and  be  glad : 
for  this  thy  brother  was  dead,  and  is  alive  again;  and 
was  lost,  and  is  found. 

Synaxarion 

On  This  Day  We  Commemorate  the  Parable  of 
THE  Prodigal  Son,  Which  Occurs  in  the  Noble 
Gospel  and  Which  our  Deified  Fathers  Re-insti- 
tuted IN  THE  TRIODION. 

Stichos 

O  Thou  who  art  like  me,  a  prodigal,  come  for- 
ward WITH  CONFIDENCE  AND  TRANQUILITY;  FOR  UNTO 
ALL  HAS  BEEN  OPENED  THE  DOOR  OF  DIVINE  MERCY. 

TN  the  gospel  parable  read  on  this  day,  the  Saviour 
illustrated  three  things :  the  condition  of  the  sinner, 
the  canon  of  repentance,  and  the  knowledge  of  God's 
compassion.  The  divine  Fathers  prescribed  its  reading 
on  this  day,  following  the  reading  of  the  Parable  of  the 
Pharisee  and  the  Publican  (on  the  previous  Sunday) 
for  our  instruction;  for  in  the  person  of  the  prodigal 
son  we  view  the  wretched  condition  in  which  we  are  so 
long  as  we  are  wallowing  in  sin,  remote  from  God  and 
his  undefiled  Sacraments.  Finally,  we  become  aware 
of  ourselves  and  awaken,  hastening  our  return  to  him 
through  repentance,  even  in  these  days  of  holy  fasting. 
The  holy  Fathers  had  another  purpose.  Because 
some  people  commit  grave  sins  and  iniquities,  persist- 
ing therein  for  a  long  time,  they  are  overtaken  by  des- 
pair, thinking  that  they  have  no  more  hope  of  forgive- 
ness.    In  this  way  they  fall  deeper  and  deeper  in  their 


618  Triodion 

sinful  acts,  even  committing  worse  ones.  The  holy 
Fathers,  realizing  this,  intended  to  remove  the  evil  of 
despair  from  their  hearts,  encouraging  them  and  re- 
viving their  energies  for  deeds  of  virtue.  Thus  they 
decreed  the  reading  of  this  parable  in  the  days  preced- 
ing the  fast,  illustrating  thereby  the  compassion  of  our 
most  righteous  God,  and  that  no  sin  may  overcome  his 
kindness  and  his  inclination  for  the  love  of  mankind, 
however  great  the  sin  may  be. 

Through  thine  inefifable  love  to  mankind,  therefore, 
O  Christ  our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us.    Amen.

nothingness,  and  honoured  me  with  thy  likeness,  and 
though  I  transgressed  thy  commandment  didst  return 
me  to  the  earth  from  which  I  had  been  taken,  restore 
me  also  to  that  likeness,  that  I  may  contemplate  its  pris- 
tine beauty. 

Grant  rest,  O  Lord,  to  thy  servants,  and  array  them  in 
paradise,  where  the  ranks  of  the  saints  and  the  righteous 
ones  shine  like  stars.  There,  O  God,  grant  rest  to  thy 
slumbering  servants,  who  turn  away  from  all  their

The  Epistle:  Their  souls  shall  dwell  among  good 
things.    Unto  thee  will  I  cry,  O  Lord. 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Thessalonians  (4:12-16) 

'Y^E  brethren:  We  will  not  have  you  ignorant,  con- 
^  cerning  them  that  are  asleep,  that  you  be  not  sor- 
rowful, even  as  others  who  have  no  hope. 

For  if  we  believe  that  Jesus  died,  and  rose  again; 
even  so  them  who  have  slept  through  Jesus,  will  God 
bring  with  him. 

For  this  we  say  unto  you  in  the  word  of  the  Lord, 
that  we  who  are  alive,  who  remain  unto  the  coming  of 
the  Lord,  shall  not  prevent  -them  who  have  slept. 

For  the  Lord  himself  shall  come  down  from  heaven 
with  commandment,  and  with  the  voice  of  an  archangel, 
and  with  the  trumoet  of  God :  and  the  dead  who  are  in 
Christ,  shall  rise  first. 


626  Triodion 

Then  we  who  are  alive,  who  are  left,  shall  be  taken 
up  together  with  them  in  the  clouds  to  meet  Christ,  into 
the  air,  and  so  shall  we  be  always  with  the  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (5:24-30) 

T^HE  Lord  said  to  the  Jews  which  came  unto  him: 
Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  that  he  who  heareth 
my  word,  and  believeth  him  that  sent  me,  hath  life  ever- 
lasting; and  Cometh  not  into  judgment,  but  is  passed 
from  death  to  life. 

Amen,  amen  I  say  unto  you,  that  the  hour  cometh, 
and  now  is,  when  the  dead  shall  hear  the  voice  of  the 
Son  of  God,  and  they  that  hear  shall  live. 

For  as  the  Father  hath  life  in  himself,  so  he  hath 
given  to  the  Son  also  to  have  life  in  himself: 

And  he  hath  given  him  power  to  do  judgment,  be- 
cause he  is  the  Son  of  man. 

Wonder  not  at  this;  for  the  hour  cometh,  wherein 
all  that  are  in  the  graves  shall  hear  the  voice  of  the 
Son  of  God. 

And  they  that  have  done  good  things,  shall  come 
forth  unto  the  resurrection  of  life;  but  they  that  have 
done  evil,  unto  the  resurrection  of  judgment. 

I  cannot  of  myself  do  any  thing.  As  I  hear,  so  I 
judge:  and  my  judgment  is  just;  because  I  seek  not  my 
own  will,  but  the  will  of  him  that  sent  me.

/^N  this  day  we  celebrate  a  memorial  to  all  those  of 
our  fathers,  brothers,  and  sisters  of  true  worship 
who  have  fallen  asleep  from  time  immemorial;  for  the 
Church  of  Christ  hath  received  from  the  Command- 
ments of  the  Apostles  themselves  (Command  42,  Book 
8)  the  custom  of  holding  funeral  Masses  on  the  third, 
the  ninth,  the  fortieth,  etc.  And  since  many  have  died 
at  sea,  in  the  mountains,  or  in  the  wilderness,  or,  be- 
cause of  their  poverty,  have  died  without  the  prescribed 
Masses,  the  divine  Fathers,  moved  by  their  zeal  and 
their  love  of  mankind,  instituted  a  universal  funeral 
Mass  on  this  day  for  the  souls  of  all  the  faithful  of  true 
worship,  who  have  died  from  time  immemorial,  to 
include  therein  all  those  who  did  not  for  any  reason 
receive  special  Masses. 

Further,  as  we  shall  celebrate  the  anniversary  of  the 
Second  Appearance  of  Christ  on  the  Day  of  Resurrec- 
tion, those  slumbering,  not  having  yet  been  judged,  nor 
having  received  full  recompense,  as  the  Holy  Scrip- 
tures make  clear.  (Acts  17:31;  2  St.  Peter  2:9;  and 
Heb.  11  :  39,  40),  the  Church  doubtless  performs  this 
funeral  Mass  today  at  a  fitting  time  for  the  souls  of 
those  who  have  fallen  asleep,  remembering  them,  and 
petitioning  God  to  have  compassion  on  the  sinners.  This 
she  does  in  her  great  confidence  in  God's  infinite  mercy. 
There  is  a  third  reason  why  the  holy  Fathers  instituted 
this  Mass,  namely,  that,  in  remembering  all  the  dead 
generally,  it  will  remind  us  also  of  death,  at  an  appro- 
priate time,  arousing  us  to  remorse  and  repentance. 

Grant  repose,  O  Master  Christ,  to  the  souls  of  those 
who  have  preceded  us  in  slumber,  in  the  dwelling- 
places  of  the  righteous,  and  have  mercy  upon  us;  for 
thou  alone  art  deathless.    Amen.

gnashing  of  teeth,  and  the  unceasing  pain  which  is 
theirs  who  commit  unnumbered  sins,  and  with  evil 
intent  have  enraged  thee,  O  good  One,  of  whom  I,  most 
wretched  man,  am  one,  and  the  first  among  them.

opened  and  sins  revealed,  deliver  me  then  from  that 
unquenchable  fire,  and  make  me  worthy  to  stand  at  thy 
right  hand,  O  righteous  Judge. 

The  Epistle:    Prokeimenon,  in  the  Second  Tone 

The  Lord  is  my  strength  and  my  praise. 
The  Lord  chastising  hath  chastised  me: 
But  he  hath  not  delivered  me  over  to  death. 

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (8:8  to  end;  9:1-2) 

"VT^E  brethren:  Meat  commendeth  us  not  to  God:  for 
neither,  if  we  eat,  are  we  the  better;  neither,  if  we 
eat  not,  are  we  the  worse. 

But  take  heed  lest  by  any  means  this  liberty  of  yours 
become  a  stumbling,  block  to  them  that  are  weak. 

For  if  any  man  see  thee  which  hast  knowledge  sit 
at  meat  in  the  idol's  temple,  shall  not  the  conscience  of 


Meat  Fare  Sunday  633 

him  which  is  weak  be  emboldened  to  eat  those  things 
which  are  offered  to  idols; 

And  through  thy  knowledge  shall  the  weak  brother 
perish,  for  whom  Christ  died? 

But  when  ye  sin  so  against  the  brethren,  and  wound 
their  weak  conscience,  ye  sin  against  Christ. 

Wherefore,  if  meat  make  my  brother  to  offend,  I 
will  eat  no  flesh  while  the  world  standeth,  lest  I  make 
my  brother  to  offend. 

Am  I  not  an  apostle?  am  I  not  free?  have  I  not  seen 
Jesus  Christ  our  Lord?  are  not  ye  my  work  in  the  Lord? 
If  I  be  not  an  apostle  unto  others,  yet  doubtless  I  am  to 
you :  for  the  seal  of  mine  apostleship  are  ye  in  the  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (25:31  to  end) 

TPHE  Lord  saith :  When  the  Son  of  man  shall  come 
in  his  glory,  and  all  the  holy  angels  with  him,  then 
shall  he  sit  upon  the  throne  of  his  glory: 

And  before  him  shall  be  gathered  all  nations:  and 
he  shall  separate  them  one  from  another,  as  a  shepherd 
divideth  his  sheep  from  the  goats : 

And  he  shall  set  the  sheep  on  his  right  hand,  but  the 
goats  on  the  left. 

Then  shall  the  King  say  unto  them  on  his  right  hand, 
Come,  ye  blessed  of  my  Father,  inherit  the  kingdom 
prepared  for  you  from  the  foundation  of  the  world: 

For  I  was  an  hungered,  and  ye  gave  me  meat:  I  was 
thirsty,  and  ye  gave  me  drink:  I  was  a  stranger,  and  ye 
took  me  in: 

Naked,  and  ye  clothed  me:  I  was  sick,  and  ye  visited 
me:  I  was  in  prison,  and  ye  came  unto  me. 

Then  shall  the  righteous  answer  him,  saying,  Lord, 
when  saw  we  thee  an  hungered,  and  fed  thee?  or  thirsty, 
and  gave  thee  drink? 

When  saw  we  thee  a  stranger,  and  took  thee  in?  or 
naked,  and  clothed  thee? 

Or  when  saw  we  thee  sick,  or  in  prison,  and  came 
unto  thee? 


634  Triodion 

And  the  King  shall  answer  and  say  unto  them,  Verily 
I  say  unto  you,  Inasmuch  as  ye  have  done  it  unto  one 
of  the  least  of  these  my  brethren,  ye  have  done  it  unto 
me. 

Then  shall  he  say  also  unto  them  on  the  left  hand, 
Depart  from  me,  ye  cursed,  into  everlasting  fire,  pre- 
pared for  the  devil  and  his  angels: 

For  I  was  an  hungered,  and  ye  gave  me  no  meat :  I 
was  thirsty,  and  ye  gave  me  no  drink: 

I  was  a  stranger,  and  ye  took  me  not  in:  naked,  and 
ye  clothed  me  not:  sick,  and  in  prison,  and  ye  visited  me 
not. 

Then  shall  they  also  answer  him,  saying.  Lord,  when 
saw  we  thee  an  hungered,  or  athirst,  or  a  stranger,  or 
naked,  or  sick,  or  in  prison,  and  did  not  minister  unto 
thee? 

Then  shall  he  answer  them,  saying.  Verily  I  say  unto 
you.  Inasmuch  as  ye  did  it  not  to  one  of  the  least  of 
these,  ye  did  it  not  to  me. 

And  these  shall  go  away  into  everlasting  punishment:

so  lest  some  who  are  lazy  should  loiter  and  spend  the

Second  Appearance  of  Christ,  which  shows  no  favours 
may  be  celebrated,  intending  thereby  to  remind  them 
that,  as  God  is  good  and  loving  to  mankind,  he  is  also 
a  very  righteous  Judge  who  recompenses  each  accord- 
ing to  his  deeds. 

The  purpose  of  the  holy  Fathers,  therefore,  was  to 
awaken  us  from  the  inadvertency  of  slothfulness  by  re- 
minding us  of  that  terrible  day  and  by  arousing  our 
energy  to  the  work  of  virtue,  by  urging  us  to  compas- 
sion, mercy,  and  the  love  of  one  another.  And  since 
on  the  following  Sunday  falls  the  Carnival  of  Cheese, 
there  is  held  the  anniversary  of  the  expulsion  of  Adam 
from  the  paradise  of  bliss  which  marks  the  beginning 
of  our  present  life.  Hence  the  Feast  that  falls  on  this 
day  is  the  last  of  the  Feasts;  for  in  truth  on  it  end  all 
our  affairs  and  the  world  itself. 

Wherefore,  by  the  abundance  of  thine  inefifable  com-

arouse  their  soldiers'  courage  by  reminding  them  of

and  make  them  attack  the  enemy  with  valour  with 
steadfast  steps,  so  also  did  the  divine  Fathers  deal  with 
us.  Thus  they  decreed  that  on  this  day  there  shall  be 
a  remembrance  and  a  Feast  of  all  the  saints  who  pleased 
God,  vanquishing  passion  and  sufferings  by  great  trib-

steps  as  far  as  possible,  bravely  striving  against  suffer-

eyes  and  acting  as  though  they  were  men  like  us,  who 
have  the  same  nature  as  we. 

Wherefore,  through  the  intercession  of  all  the  right-

^On.  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  etc.,  six  for  the  Resurrection,  and 
four  for  the  Triodion,  in  the  Sixth   Tone. 

\TERILY,  the  Lord,  my  Creator,  took  dust  from  the 
earth  and  with  life-giving  breath  gave  me  a  soul 
and  revived  me,  honouring  me  and  setting  me  in  the 
earth  as  chief  of  all  things  visible,  to  live  like  the  an- 
gels. But  deceiving  Satan,  using  the  serpent  as  an  in- 
strument, deceived  me  through  eating,  and  separated 
me  from  the  glory  of  God,  delivering  me  by  nether 
death  to  the  earth.  But  since  thou  art  Lord  and  com- 
passionate, recall  thou  me. 

Lord,  when  I  disobeyed  thy  divine  command  at  the 
counsel  of  the  adversary,  I,  wretched  one,  was  stripped 
of  my  God-woven  robe.  And  now  I  have  put  on  the 
mantle  of  skin  and  fig-leaves,  and  have  been  condemned 
to  eat  in  sweat  the  bread  of  hardship.  The  earth  was 
cursed  to  bring  forth  thorns  and  husks  for  me.  Albeit, 
O  thou  who  in  the  last  days  wast  incarnate  from  the 
Virgin,  recall  me  and  make  me  to  enter  the  paradise 
of  bliss. 


638  Triodion 

O  most  honoured  paradise,  comeliness  transcendent 
in  splendour,  the  dwelling-place  perfected  by  God,  un- 
ending joy  and  enjoyment,  the  glory  of  the  righteous, 
the  joy  of  the  Prophets,  and  the  dwelling-place  of  the 
saints,  beseech  the  Creator  -of  all,  by  the  tune  of  the 
rustling  of  thy  leaves,  to  open  for  me  the  gates  which  I 
closed  by  sin,  and  that  I  be  worthy  to  partake  of  the 
tree  of  life  and  joy,  which  I  enjoyed  in  thee  of  old. 

Woe  is  me!  Verily,  Adam  by  disobedience  was  ex- 
iled from  paradise  and  driven  from  bliss,  having  been 
deceived  by  the  words  of  the  woman;  and  he  sat  oppo- 
site Eden  naked  and  wailing.  Let  us  all,  therefore,  be 
careful  how  we  receive  the  season  of  fasting,  obeying 
the  traditions  of  the  Gospels,  that,  becoming  thereby 
acceptable  to  Christ,  we  may  once  more  attain  to  para- 
dise. 

Glory,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

^X/'ERILY,  Adam  sat  opposite  paradise  bewailing  his 
'  nakedness  and  crying,  Woe  is  me,  the  robbed  one. 
who  hearkened  to  the  evil  deception,  and  was  driven 
away  from  glory.  Woe  is  me,  who  through  simplicity 
of  heart  became  naked,  and  am  now  perplexed.  Where- 
fore, O  paradise,  I  shall  no  more  attain  thy  bliss,  nor 
behold  my  Lord,  my  God,  and  my  Creator;  for  I  shall 
return  to  the  earth  from  which  I  was  taken,  and  I  shall 
cry  to  thee,  O  compassionate  One,  have  mercy  upon  me 
who  am  fallen. 

The  Aposticha  for  the  Resurrection,  and  Glory,

^V/'ERILY,  Adam  for  eating  was  driven  from  para- 
dise. Wherefore,  he  sat  opposite  thereto,  wailing 
and  mourning  in  a  pitiful  voice,  saying,  Woe  is  me; 
what  hath  befallen  me,  wretched  man?  I  transgressed 
one  commandment  of  my  Lord  and  was  denied  all  kinds 
of  good  things.  Wherefore,  O  most  holy  paradise, 
which  for  me  wast  planted,  and  for  the  sake  of  Eve

wast  closed,  implore  him  who  made  thee,  that  I  may 
contemplate  the  flowers  of  thy  gardens.  Therefore,  the 
Saviour  cried  out  to  him,  saying,  I  desire  not  the  loss 
of  my  creation,  but  that  it  be  saved,  and  come  to  the 
knowledge  of  the  truth;  for  he  that  cometh  to  me,  I 
shall  not  cast  out.

cast  out  of  paradise,  O  compassionate  One.  Where- 
fore, O  merciful  One,  have  mercy  upon  me,  who  was 
justly  denied  thy  good  things. 

O  Lord,  we  were  estranged  before  from  paradise, 
because  of  eating  from  the  tree.  Therefore,  lead  us 
into  it  again  by  thy  Cross  and  by  thy  Passion,  my  Sav-

^X/'ERILY,  Adam  cried  moaning,  and  said,  Woe  is 
me;  for  the  serpent  and  the  woman  drew  me  away 
from  divine  favour;  and  the  taste  of  the  tree  hath  es- 
tranged me  from  paradise.  Woe  is  me;  I  cannot  bear 
the  disgrace,  I  who  was  formerly  king  over  all  earthly 
creatures.  Behold,  I  am  now  captive  because  of  a 
counsel  aside  from  the  law.  And  I,  who  was  for  a  time 
robed  with  the  glory  of  immortality,  have  become  like 
one  dead,  wrapped  in  the  rags  of  death,  in  a  pitiful 
manner.  Woe  is  me;  whom  shall  I  make  my  helper 
in  wailing?     But  thou,  Lover  of  mankind,  mantled  in

When  Adam  received  of  the  food,  as  a  transgressor 
was  he  driven  from  paradise.  But  Moses,  purifying 
the  pupils  of  his  eyes  with  fasting,  was  made  worthy  to 
behold  God.  Wherefore,  ye  who  long  to  dwell  in  para- 
dise, come,  let  us  keep  far  from  unprofitable  food;  and 
ye  who  desire  to  see  God,  come,  let  us  fast  the  four 
Mosaic  tens.  And  by  perseverance  and  sincerity  in 
prayer  we  shall  put  down  the  passions  of  the  soul  and 
remove  the  wiles  of  the  flesh,  ascending  lightly  towards 
the  celestial  way,  where  the  ranks  of  angels  praise  the 
indivisible  Trinity  with  unceasing  voices,  to  behold  the 
transcending  comeliness  of  the  Master.  Therefore,  O 
life-giving  Son  of  God,  make  us  who  trust  in  thee, 
worthy  there  to  exchange  glad  tidings  with  the  hosts  of 
angels;  by  the  intercessions  of  the  passion  of  thy

\7'E  brethren:  Now  our  salvation  is  nearer  than  when 
-'■    we  believed. 

The  night  is  far  spent,  the  day  is  at  hand:  Let  us 
therefore  cast  ofif  the  works  of  darkness,  and  let  us  put 
on  the  armour  of  light. 

Let  us  walk  honestly,  as  in  the  day;  not  in  rioting  and 
drunkenness,  not  in  chambering  and  wantonness,  not  in 
strife  and  envying: 

But  put  ye  on  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  make  not 
provision  for  the  flesh,  to  fulfil  the  lusts  thereof. 

Him  that  is  weak  in  the  faith  receive  ye,  but  not  to 
doubtful  disputations. 

For  one  believeth  that  he  may  eat  all  things :  another, 
who  is  weak,  eateth  herbs. 

Let  not  him  that  eateth  despise  him  that  eateth  not; 
and  let  not  him  which  eateth  not  judge  him  that  eateth : 
for  God  hath  received  him. 

Who  art  thou  that  judgest  another  man's  servant? 
to  his  own  master  he  standeth  or  falleth.  Yea,  he  shall 
be  holden  up:  for  God  is  able  to  make  him  stand. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (6:14-21) 

nPHE  Lord  saith:  If  ye  forgive  men  their  trespasses, 
your  heavenly  Father  will  also  forgive  you; 
But  if  ye  forgive  not  men  their  trespasses,  neither 
will  your  Father  forgive  your  trespasses. 


642  Triodion 

Moreover  when  ye  fast,  be  not,  as  the  hypocrites,  of 
a  sad  countenance:  for  they  disfigure  their  faces,  that 
they  may  appear  unto  men  to  fast.  Verily  I  say  unto 
you,  They  have  their  reward. 

But  thou,  when  thou  fastest,  anoint  thine  head,  and 
wash  thy  face; 

That  thou  appear  not  unto  men  to  fast,  but  unto  thy 
Father  which  is  in  secret:  and  thy  Father  which  seeth 
in  secret  shall  reward  thee  openly. 

Lay  not  up  for  yourselves  treasures  upon  earth,  where 
moth  and  rust  doth  corrupt,  and  where  thieves  break 
through  and  steal: 

But  lay  up  for  yourselves  treasures  in  heaven,  where 
neither  moth  nor  rust  doth  corrupt,  and  where  thieves 
do  not  break  through  nor  steal : 

For  where  your  treasure  is,  there  will  your  heart  be

piness by  means  of  fasting  and  obedience  to  all  the 
divine  commandments. 

Wherefore,  through  thine  inefifable  compassion,  O 
Christ  our  Lord,  make  us  worthy  of  the  paradise  of 
bliss,  and  have  mercy  upon  us,  O  thou  who  art  alone

^On  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  etc.,  the  following  Frosornia  for 
the  Triodion,  in  the  Second  Tone. 

T  ET  us  all  hasten  to  the  subjugation  of  the  flesh  by 
^-^  abstinence,  as  we  approach  the  divine  battle-field, 
the  battle-field  of  blameless  fasting.  Let  us  pray  the 
Lord,  our  Saviour,  in  tears  and  prayers,  turning  away 
completely  from  sin,  and  crying.  We  have  sinned 
against  thee,  O  Christ  the  King.  Save  us,  therefore, 
as  of  old  thou  didst  save  the  people  of  Ninevah;  and 
make  us  partakers  of  thy  heavenly  kingdom,  O  com- 
passionate One. 

If  I  were  to  imagine  all  my  sins  deserving  all  pun- 
ishment, I  would  despair  of  myself,  O  Lord  Saviour; 
for  by  them  have  I  disobeyed  thy  noble  commandment, 
wasting  my  life  in  extravagance.     Wherefore,   I  be-

644  Triodion 

seech  thee  to  purify  me  with  thy  showers  of  forgive- 
ness, and  lighten  me  with  fasting  and  supplication;  for 
thou  alone  art  compassionate;  and  reject  me  not,  O  all- 
bountiful  and  of  transcendent  goodness. 

Let  us  begin  the  season  of  fasting  with  rejoicing, 
giving  ourselves  to  spiritual  strife,  purifying  soul  and 
body,  fasting  from  passions,  as  we  fast  from  foods,  far- 
ing on  the  virtues  of  the  Spirit,  which,  if  we  continue 
to  long  for,  we  shall  all  be  worthy  to  behold  the  most 
solemn  Passion  of  Christ,  and  the  holy  passover,  rejoic- 
ing with  spiritual  joy. 

C^Glory  and  Now  to  our  Lady ;  and  after  O  resplendent  Light,  etc, 
the  following  Prokei?nenon,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

Turn  not  away  thy  face  from  thy  servant;  for  I  am 
in  trouble:  hear  me  speedily.  Attend  to  my  soul,  and 
deliver  it. 

Stichos:  Thy  salvation,  O  God,  hath  set  me  up.  The 
poor  see  and  rejoice. 

^And  in  the  Aposticha,  the  following  Idiomelons,  in  the  Fourth 
Tone. 

^  I  ^HY  grace  hath  risen,  O  Lord,  the  illumination  of 
our  souls  hath  shone  forth.  Lo,  now  is  the  accept- 
able time;  the  season  of  repentance  hath  come.  Let  us 
cast  down  the  works  of  darkness,  and  put  on  the  works 
of  light,  that  we  may  pass  the  great  tempest  of  fasting 
and  reach  the  summit  of  the  third-day  Resurrection  of 
our  Lord  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ,  the  Saviour  of  our 
souls.     (Repeat.) 

O  Christ  God,  glorified  in  the  mention  of  thy  saints, 
send  us,  through  their  beseechings,  the  Great  Mercy.

T^HE  ranks  of  angels  praise  thee,  O  most  holy  Theo- 

tokos;  for  thou  didst  bear  God  who  for  ever  is  with 

the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  by  whose  will  the  ranks 

of  angels  arose  from  nothing.    Wherefore,  beseech  him

to  save  and  lighten  the  souls  of  those  who  praise  thee 
in  Orthodoxy,  O  most  pure  one. 

^And  after,  Holy  God,  the  following  Troparia. 

T^  EJOICE,  O  virgin  Theotokos,  Mary  full  of  grace; 
-■-^the  Lord  is  with  thee.  Blessed  art  thou  among 
women,  and  blessed  the  fruit  of  thy  womb;  for  thou 
didst  give  birth  to  the  Saviour  of  our  souls. 

O  Baptizer  of  Christ,  remember  our  congregation, 
that  we  may  escape  from  our  iniquities;  for  to  thee  was 
given  grace  to  intercede  for  us. 

Glory:  O  pure  Apostles,  and  all  ye  saints,  pray  for 
our  sakes,  that  we  escape  tribulations  and  sorrows;  for 
we  have  taken  you  as  fervid  intercessors  with  the  Sav- 
iour. 

Now:  We  have  taken  refuge  under  the  wing  of  thy 
compassion,  O  Theotokos.  Turn  not  away  from  our  be- 
seechings  in  tribulation,  but  save  us  from  distress,  O 
thou  who  alone  art  pure  and  blessed. 

^And  after  Lord,  have  mercy  {forty  times) ,  the  Priest  saith: 

Christ  our  God  who  remaineth  blessed  always,  now 
and  for  ever,  and  unto  the  ages  of  ages. 

Lector.  O  heavenly  King,  support  our  believing 
kings;  confirm  their  faith;  guide  the  nations;  give  peace 
to  the  world;  and  preserve  well  this  holy  church.  Grant 
repose  to  our  departed  fathers  and  brothers,  in  the 
dwelling-places  of  the  righteous.  Receive  us  in  repent- 
ance and  confession;  for  thou  art  good  and  the  Lover 
of  mankind. 

^Then  make  the  three  great  reverences,  responding  to  each  with  a 
part  of  the  following  prayer  of  St.  Iphram  the  Syrian. 

r\  LORD  and  Master  of  my  life,  deliver  me  from 
the  spirit  of  indolence,  meddling,  ambition,  and 
vain  talk. 

But  bestow  thou  upon  me  thy  servant  the  spirit  of 
chastity,  meekness  of  mind,  patience,  and  love. 


646  Triodion 

Yea,  King  and  God,  grant  that  I  may  know  my  sins 
and  my  faults,  and  not  judge  my  brother;  for  thou  art 
blessed  for  ever.    Amen. 

^The?i  the  Choir  singeth  the  following   Troparion,  in  the  Second 
To7ie. 

Q  RIGHTEOUS  one,  Mother  of  the  most  high 
God,  defend  all  those  who  take  refuge  in  faith  in 
thy  precious  protection;  for  we  sinners,  bowed  by  the 
multitude  of  sins,  have  no  other  constant  intercessor 
with  God  in  tribulations  and  sorrows,  save  thee.  Where- 
fore, we  bow  to  thee,  adoring.  Save  thou  thy  servants 
from  every  distress. 

Then:  Through  the  prayers  of  our  Fathers  the  saints, 
O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Choir.    Amen. 


II.    THE  HOLY  QUADRAGESIMA,  OR 
LENTEN  FAST^

Compline  {or  Slumber  Prayer);  (2)  the  Mass  of  the  Presanctified 
Gifts;  {3}  the  Great  Canon;  and  (4)  the  Praise  of  the  Akathiston

Great  Compline 

^Great  Compline  is  recited  during  the  period  of  the  Great  Fast,  on 
the  evening  of  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,  and  Thursday,  until 
Great  Tuesday. 


1  The  period  of  this  Fast  is  exactly  forty  days  from  the  Monday  after 
Cheese  Fare  to  the  Friday  preceding  Lazarus  Saturday.  The  last  week,  how 
ever,  which  is  called  Passion  Week,  is  a  special  Fast  to  the  honour  of  the 
Passion  of  our  Lord  and  God  Jesus  Christ. 


Quadragesima — Great  Compline  647 

^After  Blessed  be  God,  etc;  O  heavenly  King,  etc;  Holy  God,  etc; 
Lord,  have  mercy  {two  times);  and  O  come,  let  us  worship,  etc, 
{three  times  with  three  reverences)  begin  thus: 

Psalm  4 
When  I  called  upon  him,  etc.  (p.  68). 

Psalm  6 

0  Lord,  rebuke  me  not  in  thy  indignation,  etc.  (p. 
69). 

Psalm  12 

T-JOW  long  wilt  thou  forget  me,  O  Lord?  for  ever? 
how  long  wilt  thou  hide  thy  face  from  me? 

How  long  shall  I  take  counsel  in  my  soul,  having 
sorrow  in  my  heart  daily?  how  long  shall  mine  enemy 
be  exalted  over  me? 

Consider  and  hear  me,  O  Lord  my  God  :  lighten  mine 
eyes,  lest  I  sleep  the  sleep  of  death; 

Lest  mine  enemy  say,  I  have  prevailed  against  him; 
and  those  that  trouble  me  rejoice  when  I  am  moved. 

But  I  have  trusted  in  thy  mercy;  my  heart  shall  re- 
joice in  thy  salvation. 

1  will  sing  unto  the  Lord,  because  he  hath  dealt 
bountifully  with  me. 

Consider  and  hear  me,  O  Lord  my  God:  lighten 
mine  eyes,  lest  I  sleep  the  sleep  of  death; 

Lest  mine  enemy  say,  I  have  prevailed  against  him. 

^Glory  and  Now:  Alleluia  {three  times);  {three  reverences); 
Lord,  have  mercy,  etc.  {three  times);  and  Glory  and  Now. 

Psalm  24 

T  INTO  thee,  O  Lord,  do  I  lift  up  my  soul. 

^   O  my  God,  I  trust  in  thee:  let  me  not  be  ashamed, 

let  not  mine  enemies  triumph  over  me. 

Yea,  let  none  that  wait  on  thee  be  ashamed  which 
transgress  without  cause. 


648  Triodion 

Show  me  thy  ways,  O  Lord;  teach  me  thy  paths. 

Lead  me  in  thy  truth,  and  teach  me:  for  thou  art 
the  God  of  my  salvation;  on  thee  do  I  wait  all  the  day. 

Remember,  O  Lord,  thy  tender  mercies  and  thy  lov- 
ingkindnesses;  for  they  have  been  ever  of  old. 

Remember  not  the  sins  of  my  youth,  nor  my  trans- 
gressions :  according  to  thy  mercy  remember  thou  me 
for  thy  goodness'  sake,  O  Lord. 

Good  and  upright  is  the  Lord  :  therefore  will  he  teach 
sinners  in  the  way. 

The  meek  will  he  guide  in  judgment:  and  the  meek 
will  he  teach  his  way. 

All  the  paths  of  the  Lord  are  mercy  and  truth  unto 
such  as  keep  his  covenant  and  his  testimonies. 

For  thy  name's  sake,  O  Lord,  pardon  mine  iniquity; 
for  it  is  great. 

What  man  is  he  that  feareth  the  Lord?  him  shall  he 
teach  in  the  way  that  he  shall  choose. 

His  soul  shall  dwell  at  ease;  and  his  seed  shall  inherit 
the  earth. 

The  secret  of  the  Lord  is  with  them  that  fear  him; 
and  he  will  show  them  his  covenant. 

Mine  eyes  are  ever  toward  the  Lord;  for  he  shall 
pluck  my  feet  out  of  the  net. 

Turn  thee  unto  me,  and  have  mercy  upon  me;  for  I 
am  desolate  and  afflicted. 

The  troubles  of  my  heart  are  enlarged :  O  bring  thou 
me  out  of  my  distresses. 

Look  upon  mine  affliction  and  my  pain;  and  forgive 
all  my  sins. 

Consider  mine  enemies;  for  they  are  many;  and  they 
hate  me  with  cruel  hatred. 

O  keep  my  soul,  and  deliver  me:  let  me  not  be 
ashamed;  for  I  put  my  trust  in  thee. 

Let  integrity  and  uprightness  preserve  me;  for  I  wait 
on  thee. 

Redeem  Israel,  O  God,  out  of  all  his  troubles. 


Quadragesima — Great  Compline  649 

Psalm  30 

TN  thee,  O  Lord,  do  I  put  my  trust;  let  me  never  be 

ashamed :  deliver  me  in  thy  righteousness. 

Bow  down  thine  ear  to  me;  deliver  me  speedily:  be 
thou  my  strong  rock,  for  a  house  of  defense  to  save  me. 

For  thou  art  my  rock  and  my  fortress;  therefore  for 
thy  name's  sake  lead  me,  and  guide  me. 

Pull  me  out  of  the  net  that  they  have  laid  privily  for 
me :  for  thou  art  my  strength. 

Into  thine  hand  I  commit  my  spirit:  thou  hast  re- 
deemed me,  O  Lord  God  of  truth. 

I  have  hated  them  that  regard  lying  vanities :  but  I 
trust  in  the  Lord. 

I  will  be  glad  and  rejoice  in  thy  mercy:  for  thou  hast 
considered  my  trouble;  for  thou  hast  known  my  soul  in 
adversities; 

And  hast  not  shut  me  up  into  the  hand  of  the  enemy: 
thou  hast  set  my  feet  in  a  large  room. 

Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  Lord,  for  I  am  in  trouble: 
mine  eye  is  consumed  with  grief,  yea,  my  soul  and  my 
belly. 

For  my  life  is  spent  with  grief,  and  my  years  with 
sighing:  my  strength  faileth  because  of  mine  iniquity, 
and  my  bones  are  consumed. 

I  was  a  reproach  among  all  mine  enemies,  but  espe- 
cially among  my  neighbors,  and  a  fear  to  mine  ac- 
quaintance: they  that  did  see  me  without,  fled  from  me. 

I  am  forgotten  as  a  dead  man  out  of  mind :  I  am  like 
a  broken  vessel. 

For  I  have  heard  the  slander  of  many:  fear  was  on 
every  side:  while  they  took  counsel  together  against 
me,  they  devised  to  take  away  my  life. 

But  I  trusted  in  thee,  O  Lord :  I  said.  Thou  art  my 
God. 

My  times  are  in  thy  hand :  deliver  me  from  the  hand 
of  mine  enemies,  and  from  them  that  persecute  me. 

Make  thy  face  to  shine  upon  thy  servant:  save  me 
for  thy  mercies'  sake. 


650  Triodion 

Let  me,  not  be  ashamed,  O  Lord;  for  I  have  called 
upon  thee :  let  the  wicked  be  ashamed,  and  let  them  be 
silent  in  the  grave. 

Let  the  lying  lips  be  put  to  silence;  which  speak 
grievous  things  proudly  and  contemptuously  against 
the  righteous. 

Oh  how  great  is  thy  goodness,  which  thou  hast  laid 
up  for  them  that  fear  thee;  which  thou  hast  wrought 
for  them  that  trust  in  thee  before  the  sons  of  men! 

Thou  shalt  hide  them  in  the  secret  of  thy  presence 
from  the  pride  of  man:  thou  shalt  keep  them  secretly 
in  a  pavilion  from  the  strife  of  tongues. 

Blessed  be  the  Lord:  for  he  hath  showed  me  his 
marvelous  kindness  in  a  strong  city. 

For  I  said  in  my  haste,  I  am  cut  off  from  before  thine 
eyes:  nevertheless  thou  heardest  the  voice  of  my  sup- 
plications when  I  cried  unto  thee. 

O  love  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  saints :  for  the  Lord  pre- 
serveth  the  faithful,  and  plentifully  rewardeth  the 
proud  doer. 

Be  of  good  courage,  and  he  shall  strengthen  your 
heart,  all  ye  that  hope  in  the  Lord. 

Psalm  90 

He  that  dwelleth  in  the  aid  of  the  Most  High,  etc. 
(p.  385). 

^Glory  and  Now^;  Alleluia  {three  times);  Lord,  have  mercy,  {three 
times);  Glory  and  Now.  Then  the  following  Stichoi  are  sung  alter- 
nately by  both  choirs,  slowly  and  loudly,  repeating  at  the  end  of  each 
Stichos,  For  God  is  with  us.  The  Right  Choir  starts  this. 

\\T1TH  us  is  God,  understand  ye  nations  and  flee. 
For  God  is  with  us. 

Hear  ye  to  the  uttermost  ends  of  the  earth.  For  God

Ye  mighty  ones,  be  overthrown.    For  God  is  with  us. 

For  even  if  ye  rise  again  ye  shall  be  overthrown.  For

For  God  is  with  us.

And  ye  that  dwell  in  the  land  of  the  shadow  of  death,

For  unto  us  a  Son  is  born,  unto  us  a  child  is  given.

ask  thee  to  grant  me.  Saviour,  to  spend  this  evening 
and  the  rest  of  the  night  without  sin;  and  to  save  me.

thee  in  unsilenced  praise. 

And  the  seraphim,  those  six-winged  beasts,  exalt  thee 
in  unceasing  voices. 

And  all  the  hosts  of  angels  praise  thee  with  thrice- 
holy  Alleluia. 

For  before  all  thou  art  still,  O  Father;  and  hast  with 
thee  thy  Son,  who,  like  thee,  is  without  beginning. 

And  as  thou  bearest  the  Spirit  of  life,  equal  to  thee 
in  honour,  thou  dost  make  manifest  the  indivisible 
Trinity. 

O  Virgin,  the  most  holy  Theotokos;  and  ye  eye-wit-

Intercede  ceaselessly  for  all;  for  we  are  all  in  dis-

Now:  For  verily,  we  have  no  favour,  for  the  multi- 
tude of  our  sins.  Therefore,  O  virgin  Theotokos,  plead 
thou  with  him  that  was  born  of  thee;  for  the  pleadings 
of  the  Mother  are  indeed  effective  in  seeking  the  favour 
of  the  Master.  Turn  thou  not  away  therefore  from  the 
pleadings  of  sinners,  O  most  venerable  one;  for  he  who

Wherefore,  I  entrust  my  soul  to  thy  hands.     Cover  me

with  the  wings  of  thy  goodness,  lest  I  sleep  unto  death. 
Lighten  my  inner  eyes  with  the  delight  of  thy  divine 
sayings,  and  wake  me  at  a  time  proper  for  thy  glorifi- 
cation, since  thou  art  good  and  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:   Look  thou  upon  me  and  have  mercy  on  me. 

Thy  judgment,  O  Lord,  is  verily  terrible,  when  the 
angels  shall  be  standing,  men  assembled,  the  books 
opened,  works  uncovered,  and  thoughts  searched.  What 
judgment  then  will  be  mine,  who  am  enmeshed  in  sins? 
Who  shall  extinguish  the  flames  of  fire  for  me?  Who 
shall  lighten  my  darkness  if  thou  have  not  mercy  upon 
me,  O  Lord,  since  thou  art  the  Lover  of  mankind? 

Glory:  Give  me  tears,  O  God,  as  thou  gavest  the  sin- 
ful woman  of  old.  Make  me  always  worthy  to  wash 
thy  feet  which  delivered  me  from  the  way  of  error,  to 
ofifer  thee  fragrant  ointment,  a  pure  life  bought  with 
repentance,  that  I,  too,  may  hear  thy  good  voice.  Thy 
faith  hath  saved  thee.    Depart  in  peace. 

Now:  Having  possessed,  O  Theotokos,  unforsaking 
confidence  in  thee,  whereby  I  am  saved;  and  having 
attained  thy  help,  O  most  pure  one,  whence  I  fear  not, 
I  shall  pursue  mine  enemies  and  drive  them  away,  tak- 
ing along  thy  refuge  as  a  breastplate,  and  crying  to  thy 
all-powerful  help.  Save  me,  therefore,  O  Lady,  by 
thine  intercession,  and  wake  me  from  dark  sleep  to  thy 
glorification;  by  the  might  of  the  Son  of  God,  incarnate 
of  thee. 

^Thcn,  Lord,  have  mercy  (forty  times);  Glory  and  Now,  O  thou

By  Basil  the  Great 

T  ORD,  Lord,  who  hast  delivered  us  from  every  ar- 
row  that  flieth  by  day,  save  us  from  every  crea- 
ture that  walketh  in  darkness,  and  accept  the  lifting  up 
of  our  hands  as  an  evening  oflfering.  Prepare  us  to 
pass  the  span  of  night  blameless  and  untempted  by  evils. 
Deliver  us  from  every  trouble  and  dismay  that  cometh 
to  us  from  Satans.    Grant  our  souls  reverence,  and  our

minds  diligence  to  search  thy  just  and  terrible  judg- 
ment. Pierce  our  bodies  with  fear,  and  mortify  our 
members  that  are  on  earth  that  in  the  stillness  of  the 
night  me  may  be  lighted  by  the  contemplation  of  thy 
precepts.  Drive  from  us  every  evil  imagination  and 
harmful  passion,  and  raise  us  in  time  of  prayer,  estab- 
lished in  the  Faith  and  prospering  in  thy  command- 
ments, by  the  pleasure  and  goodness  of  thine  only  Son, 
who  art  blessed  with  him,  and  with  thy  good  and  most 
Holy  Spirit,  the  Life-giver,  now  and  always,  and  unto 
ages  of  ages.    Amen. 

C^Then,  O  come,  let  us  worship,  etc.  {three  times  with  three  rever- 
ences). 

Psalm  50 
Have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God,  etc.  (p.  82). 

Psalm  101 

T-JEAR  my  prayer,  O  Lord,  and  let  my  cry  come  unto 
^  ^  thee. 

Hide  not  thy  face  from  me  in  the  day  when  I  am  in 
trouble;  incline  thine  ear  unto  me:  in  the  day  when  I 
call  answer  me  speedily. 

For  my  days  are  consumed  like  smoke,  and  my  bones 
are  burned  as  a  hearth. 

My  heart  is  smitten,  and  withered  like  grass;  so  that 
I  forget  to  eat  my  bread. 

By  reason  of  the  voice  of  my  groaning  my  bones 
cleave  to  my  skin. 

I  am  like  a  pelican  of  the  wilderness:  I  am  like  an 
owl  of  the  desert. 

I  watch,  and  am  as  a  sparrow  alone  upon  the  house- 
top. 

Mine  enemies  reproach  me  all  the  day;  and  they 
that  are  mad  against  me  are  sworn  against  me. 

For  I  have  eaten  ashes  like  bread,  and  mingled  my 
drink  with  weeping. 

Because  of  thine  indignation  and  thy  wrath :  for  thou 
hast  lifted  me  up,  and  cast  me  down, 


656  Triodion 

My  days  are  like  a  shadow  that  declineth;  and  I  am 
withered  like  grass. 

But  thou,  O  Lord,  shalt  endure  for  ever;  and  thy 
remembrance  unto  all  generations. 

Thou  shalt  arise,  and  have  mercy  upon  Zion:  for  the 
time  to  favour  her,  yea,  the  set  time,  is  come. 

For  thy  servants  take  pleasure  in  her  stones,  and 
favour  the  dust  thereof. 

So  the  heathen  shall  fear  the  name  of  the  Lord,  and 
all  the  kings  of  the  earth  thy  glory. 

When  the  Lord  shall  build  up  Zion,  he  shall  appear 
in  his  glory. 

He  will  regard  the  prayer  of  the  destitute,  and  not 
despise  their  prayer. 

This  shall  be  written  for  the  generation  to  come: 
and  the  people  which  shall  be  created  shall  praise  the 
Lord. 

For  he  hath  looked  down  from  the  height  of  his 
sanctuary;  from  heaven  did  the  Lord  behold  the  earth; 

To  hear  the  groaning  of  the  prisoner;  to  loose  those 
that  are  appointed  to  death; 

To  declare  the  name  of  the  Lord  in  Zion,  and  his 
praise  in  Jerusalem; 

When  the  people  are  gathered  together,  and  the 
kingdoms,  to  serve  the  Lord. 

He  weakened  my  strength  in  the  way;  he  shortened 
my  days. 

I  said,  O  my  God,  take  me  not  away  in  the  midst 
of  my  days :  thy  years  are  throughout  all  generations. 

Of  old  hast  thou  laid  the  foundation  of  the  earth: 
and  the  heavens  are  the  work  of  thy  hands. 

They  shall  perish,  but  thou  shalt  endure:  yea,  all 
of  them  shall  wax  old  like  a  garment;  as  a  ve'^ture 
shalt  thou  change  them,  and  they  shall  be  changed : 

But  thou  art  the  same,  and  thy  years  shall  have  no 
end. 

The  children  of  thy  servants  shall  continue,  and 
their  seed  shall  be  established  before  thee.

The  Prayer  of  Manasseh,  King  of  Judah 

Q  MIGHTY  Lord,  thou  God  of  our  fathers,  of 
Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  and  of  their  righteous 
seed;  who  hast  made  heaven  and  earth  with  all  the 
array  thereof;  who  hast  bound  the  sea  by  the  word 
of  thy  command;  who  hast  shut  up  the  deep  and  sealed 
it  by  thy  terrible  and  glorious  Name;  whom  all  things 
fear,  yea  and  before  whose  power  they  tremble;  for 
the  majesty  of  thy  glory  cannot  be  borne  and  the  anger 
of  thy  threatening  toward  sinners  is  intolerable;  and 
yet  thy  merciful  promise  is  immeasurable  and  un- 
searchable; for  thou  art  the  Lord  most  high,  of  great 
compassion,  long-sufifering,  abundant  in  mercy,  and 
repentest  of  the  evils  against  me. 

Thou,  O  Lord,  according  to  thy  great  goodness,  hast 
promised  repentance  and  forgiveness  to  them  that  have 
sinned  against  thee;  and  of  thine  infinite  mercies  hast 
appointed  repentance  unto  sinners,  that  they  may  be 
saved. 

Thou,  therefore,  O  Lord  of  hosts,  hast  not  appointed 
repentance  to  the  just,  to  Abraham,  to  Isaac,  and  to 
Jacob,  who  have  not  sinned  against  thee;  but  thou  hast 
appointed  repentance  unto  me  who  am  a  sinner;  for 
my  sins  are  more  in  number  than  the  sands  of  the  sea. 
My  transgressions,  O  Lord,  are  multiplied,  my  trans- 
gressions are  multiplied,  and  I  am  not  worthy  to  be- 
hold and  look  unto  the  height  of  heaven  for  the  multi- 
tude of  mine  iniquities. 

I  am  bowed  down  with  many  iron  bands,  so  that  I 
cannot  lift  up  my  head  by  reason  of  my  sins,  neither 
have  I  any  respite;  for  I  have  provoked  thy  wrath  and 
done  that  which  is  evil  before  thee;  I  did  not  thy  will, 
neither  kept  I  thy  commandments;  I  have  set  up  abom- 
inations and  multiplied  detestable  things. 

Now,  therefore,  I  bow  the  knee  of  my  heart,  beseech- 
ing thee  for  grace.  I  have  sinned,  O  Lord,  I  have 
sinned,  and  I  acknowledge  mine  iniquities:  but  I  hum- 
bly beseech  thee,  forgive  me,  O  Lord,  forgive  me,  and 


658  Triodion 

destroy  me  not  with  mine  iniquities.  Be  not  angry  with 
me  for  ever,  by  reserving  my  evils  for  me;  neither  con- 
demn me  to  the  lower  parts  of  the  earth;  for  thou,  O 
Lord,  art  the  God  of  them  that  repent;  and  in  me  wilt 
thou  show  all  thy  goodness;  for  thou  will  save  me  that 
am  unworthy,  according  to  thy  great  mercy.  And  I 
will  praise  thee  henceforth  all  the  days  of  my  life;  for 
all  the  host  of  heaven  doth  sing  thy  praise,  and  thine  is 
the  glory  for  ever  and  ever.    Amen.

thee,  O  Master,  this  supplication.  Have  mercy  upon  us. 

Glory:  Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  Lord;  for  in  thee 
have  we  put  our  trust.  Be  not  exceedingly  wroth  with 
us,  nor  remember  our  iniquities;  but  look  upon  us  now 
again;  for  thou  art  compassionate,  and  deliver  us  from 
our  enemies;  for  thou  art  our  God  and  we  are  thy  peo- 
ple. We  are  all  the  work  of  thy  hands,  and  we  have 
called  upon  thy  Name. 

Now:  Open  unto  us  the  door  of  compassion,  O 
blessed  Theotokos,  that  as  we  hope  in  thee  we  may  not 
fail  in  our  petitions.  May  we  be  delivered,  through 
thee,  from  all  adversities;  for  through  thee  hath  come 
the  salvation  of  the  Christian  race.

On  This  Day,  the  Saturday  of  the  First  Week 
OF  the  Great  Fast,  We  Celebrate  the  Splendid 
Miracle  Which  Was  Performed  by  the  Glorious 
AMONG  Martyrs,  Theodore  of  Tyre,  through  the 
Boiled  Wheat. 

Stichos 

By  the  eating  of  boiled  wheat  Theodore  has 
annexed  the  city  of  the  tyrians,  annuling  the 
stratagem  of  the  ui^fclean  food,  and  voiding  the 
cunning  of  the  heathen. 

TN  which  we  fulfill  the  remembrance  of  the  miracle 
of  boiled  wheat  which  the  great  among  Martyrs, 

Theodore  of  Tyre  worked. 

Julian  the  Apostate,  having  learned  that  Christians 

usually  purify  themselves  in  the  first  week  of  the  holy 


The  First  Sunday  667 

Quadragesima,  which,  therefore,  is  called  the  Week  of 
the  Purification  {Kathara)  ^  wished  to  force  them  to 
pollute  themselves  particularly  during  that  week.  Se- 
cretly he  commanded  that  food  made  unclean  with  the 
blood  of  sacrifices  to  idols  be  exposed  everywhere  in 
the  markets.  However,  Theodore  the  Martyr,  follow- 
ing a  revelation  of  God,  appeared  to  Aphdoxius,  Arch- 
bishop of  Constantinople,  and  revealed  to  him  the  situ- 
ation. He  commanded  him  to  call  the  faithful  to- 
gether at  once  on  Monday  morning  and  forbid  them  to 
eat  of  those  foods,  commanding  them  to  subsist  instead 
on  boiled  wheat  which  is  easy  to  prepare.  In  this  way 
the  despotic  king's  purpose  was  annulled,  and  the  peo- 
ple of  true  worship  were  kept  pure  throughout  the  week 
of  purification.  They  raised  thanks  to  the  Martyr  on 
that  day,  celebrating  his  remembrance  with  boiled 
wheat  in  that  year,  the  362nd  of  Christ.  Afterwards 
the  Church  decreed  that  remembrance  of  him  be  made 
each  year  on  the  day  corresponding  to  that  day,  in  his 
honour  and  for  the  glorification  of  God. 

Wherefore,  through  his  intercessions,  O  God,  have 
mercy  upon  us  and  save  us.    Amen. 

^The  Feast  of  this  saint  falls  on  February  seventeenth.

Which  is  known  as  the  Sunday  of  Orthodoxy,  for 
thereon  is  celebrated  the  Memorial  of  the  Holy  Icons. 

1.   Vespers 

C0«  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  six  for  the  Resurrection;  and 
the  folloiuing  four  for  the  Triodion,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 

r\  LORD  incomprehensible,  and  shining  eternally 
before  the  morning  star,  from  the  belly  of  the  im- 
material and  incorporeal  Father,  the  Prophets,  inspired 
by  thy  Spirit,  foretold  that  thou  shouldest  become  a 
child  incarnate  from  her  who  knoweth  no  wedlock,  tak- 
ing thy  place  among  men,  and  visible  to  those  who  are 


668  Triodion 

on  earth.  Wherefore,  O  compassionate  One,  by  their 
pleadings  make  worthy  of  thine  illumination  us  who 
praise  thine  ineffable  and  glorious  Resurrection. 

Verily,  the  God-proclaiming  Prophets,  when  they 
preached  thee  by  their  words,  and  honoured  thee  by 
their  deeds,  bore  the  fruits  of  unending  life;  for,  having 
refused  adamantly  to  worship  creation  apart  from  thee, 
O  Master  and  Creator,  they  renounced  the  world  evan- 
gelically, emulating  thy  Passion  which  they  had  pro- 
phesied. Wherefore,  by  their  pleadings  prepare  us  to 
pass  blamelessly  over  the  battle-field  of  abstinence,  O 
thou  who  alone  art  most  merciful. 

Though  infinite  in  thy  divine  Nature,  O  Master,  thou 
didst  condescend  to  be  incarnate  in  these  last  days,  and 
become  finite;  for  by  putting  on  the  body  thou  didst 
also  put  on  all  its  properties.  Wherefore,  we  draw  the 
likeness  of  thine  image  and  embrace  it  in  consideration 
of  its  prototype,  ascending  towards  thy  love  and  drink- 
ing therefrom  the  grace  of  healing,  following  the  divine 
traditions  of  the  Apostles. 

Verily,  the  Church  of  Christ  hath  taken  on  a  most 
honoured  adornment,  the  noble  sanctified  Icons  per- 
taining to  Christ  the  Saviour,  the  Theotokos,  and  all 
the  saints,  elevated  in  joy  and  gladness,  wherein  she 
rejoiceth  in  grace,  refuting  the  crowds  of  heretics,  glori- 
fying with  gladness  her  philanthropic  God,  who  pa- 
tiently bore  his  voluntary  sufferings  for  her  sake. 

Glory,  in  the  Second  Tone 

npHE  grace  of  truth  hath  shone,  and  the  things  which 
^  were  fore-shadowed  of  old  have  now  been  fulfilled 
openly;  for  behold,  the  Church  hath  put  on  the  incar- 
nate likeness  of  Christ,  a  world-transcending  adornment, 
in  accordance  with  the  foresign  of  the  tabernacle  of  the 
Covenant,  that,  keeping  the  Icon  of  him  whom  we 
worship  and  revere,  we  may  not  go  astray.  Let  those, 
therefore,  who  believe  not  thus  be  robed  with  confu- 
sion; for  our  kneeling  in  true  worship  (not  deifying  the 


The  First  Saturday  669 

Icon)  of  the  Incarnate  is  a  glory  to  us.  Let  us,  there- 
fore, embrace  it,  O  believers,  crying.  Save,  O  God,  thy 
people  and  bless  thine  inheritance. 

^And  Now  to  our  Lady,  in  the  Tone  in  use;  the  Aposticha  for  the 
Resurrection;  and  Glory,  in  the  Second  Tone. 

r\  YE  who  have  passed  from  evil  doctrine  to  true 
worship,  who  are  illumined  with  the  light  of 
knowledge,  let  us  clap  our  hands,  as  in  the  Psalms,  offer- 
ing God  grateful  praise.  Let  us  bow  in  adoration  to  the 
Icon  of  Christ,  the  Icon  of  the  most  Pure,  the  pictures 
of  all  the  saints  drawn  on  the  walls,  tablets,  and  holy 
vessels,  refuting  the  lie  of  the  evil-opinioned;  for  the 
adoration  of  the  picture,  Basil  saith,  is  transmitted  to 
its  prototype,  imploring  thee,  O  Christ  God,  by  the 
intercessions  of  thy  pure  Mother  and  all  the  saints,  to 
grant  us  the  Great  Mercy. 

^And  Now  to  our  Lady,  in  the  Second  Tone;  the  Troparia  for  the 
Resurrection:  then  for  the  Feast,  in  the  Second  Tone,  Thy 
pure  image  do  we  adore,  etc.   {p.  594).

1.  Old  Israel  having  passed  through  the  depth  of 
the  Red  Sea  on  unmoistened  feet,  defeated  the  power 
of  Amalek  in  the  wilderness,  by  the  hands  of  Moses 
stretched  in  the  form  of  a  cross. 

3.  Thy  Church,  O  Christ,  rejoiceth  in  thee,  crying 
unto  thee.  Thou,  Lord,  art  my  strength,  my  stay,  and 
my  refuge. 

4.  When  the  Church  saw  thee  elevated  on  the  Cross, 
O  Sun  of  justice,  she  stood  in  her  array,  shouting  to 
thee  as  is  meet,  Glory  to  thy  power,  O  Lord. 

5.  Thou,  my  Lord,  didst  come  as  Light  to  the  world, 
a  holy  Light,  turning  those  who  praise  thee  away  from 
abysmal  folly. 


670  Triodion 

6.  The  Church  haileth  thee,  O  Lord,  crying,  I  will 
sacrifice  to  thee  with  the  voice  of  praise,  purified  from 
the  vileness  of  Satan  by  the  blood  which  dripped  from 
thy  side,  because  of  thy  compassion. 

7.  The  Abrahamite  youths  in  the  furnace  in  the  land 
of  Persia  burned  with  the  fervour  of  true  worship  more 
than  with  the  fire,  crying.  Blessed  art  thou  in  the  tem- 
ple of  thy  holiness,  O  Lord. 

8. '  When  Daniel  stretched  his  hands  in  the  pit,  he 
closed  the  mouths  of  the  devouring  lions;  and  the 
youths,  lovers  of  true  worship,  when  they  girded  them- 
selves with  virtue,  quenched  the  power  of  fire,  crying. 
Bless  the  Lord,  all  ye  his  works. 

9.  An  unhewn  Stone,  O  Virgin,  opposite  thy  moun- 
tain was  cut,  but  not  by  hand,  even  Christ,  who  brought 
together  the  separated  natures.  Wherefore,  we  rejoice 
gladly,  and  glorify  thee,  O  Theotokos. 

CThen  the  Exaposteilarions  for  the  Resurrection;  and  the  following 
for  the  Triodion. 

ICXCHANGE  glad  tidings  and  clap  your  hands  to- 
^^  gether,  hailing  one  another  joyfully  and  crying. 
How  wonderful  and  how  strange  are  thy  works,  O 
Christ.  Who  dare  speak  of  thy  great  works,  thou  who 
didst  accomplish  our  accord  and  unity  in  one  Church. 
Verily,  the  fierce  spears  of  the  heretics  and  the  men- 
tion of  them  have  been  destroyed  resoundingly;  for  see- 
ing, O  most  pure  One,  thy  temple  adorned  in  splendour 
with  the  graces  of  venerable  Icons,  we  are  all  filled 
with  joy  and  gladness. 

C^And  in  the  Einos,  five  for  the  Resurrection;  and  the  following 
three  for  the  Triodion,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

T^HY  Church,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  rejoiceth  in 
thee,  O  thou  her  Bridegroom  and  her  Creator,  who 
by  thy  will,  as  becoming  God,  didst  rescue  her  from  the 
worship  of  idols,  and  joined  her  to  thee  by  thy  precious 
blood,  enjoying  the  elevation  of  the. noble  Icons.  Where- 
fore, she  praiseth  thee  in  faith,  glorifying  thee  in  joy. 


The  First  Sunday  671 

We  hang  the  likeness  of  thy  body  and  embrace  it  in 
consideration  of  its  Source,  making  plain  the  mystery 
of  thy  dispensation,  O  Lord,  Lover  of  mankind;  for 
thou  didst  not  appear  unto  us  in  delusion  or  imagina- 
tion, as  claim  the  followers  of  Mani,  those  contenders 
against  God,  but  in  truth  and  in  nature  of  the  body  by 
which  we  ascend  to  thy  divine  longing  and  love. 

Today  hath  appeared,  a  day  full  of  joy,  because  the 
splendour  of  true  doctrine  shineth  forth  brilliantly,  and 
the  Church  of  Christ  now  sparkleth,  adorned  by  the 
elevation  of  the  Icons  of  the  saints  and  their  illustrat- 
ing pictures,  and  believers  attain  there  a  unity  rewarded 
of  God.

closed  the  heavens.  As,  for  the  Abrahamite  youths,  they 
vanquished  by  fasting  the  transgressing  usurper. 
Wherefore,  through  the  same,  O  Saviour,  prepare  us 
to  meet  thy  Resurrection,  shouting.  Holy  God!  Holy

(11:24-26;  32  to  end) 

VT'E  brethren:  By  faith  Moses,  when  he  was  come  to 
''■    years,   refused  to  be  called  the  son  of   Pharaoh's 
daughter. 


672  Triodion 

Choosing  rather  to  suffer  affliction  with  the  people 
of  God,  than  to  enjoy  the  pleasures  of  sin  for  a  season; 

Esteeming  the  reproach  of  Christ  greater  riches  than 
the  treasures  in  Egypt:  for  he  had  respect  unto  the 
recompense  of  the  reward. 

And  what  shall  I  more  say?  for  the  time  would  fail 
me  to  tell  of  Gideon,  and  of  Barak,  and  of  Samson,  and 
of  Jephthae;  of  David  also,  and  Samuel,  and  of  the 
prophets : 

Who  through  faith  subdued  kingdoms,  wrought 
righteousness,  obtained  promises,  stopped  the  mouths 
of  lions. 

Quenched  the  violence  of  fire,  escaped  the  edge  of 
the  sword,  out  of  weakness  were  made  strong,  waxed 
valiant  in  fight,  turned  to  flight  the  armies  of  the  aliens. 

Women  received  their  dead  raised  to  life  again:  and 
others  were  tortured,  not  accepting  deliverance;  that 
they  might  obtain  a  better  resurrection: 

And  others  had  trial  of  cruel  mockings  and  scourg- 
ings,  yea,  moreover  of  bonds  and  imprisonment: 

They  were  stoned,  they  were  sawn  asunder,  were 
tempted,  were  slain  with  the  sword:  they  wandered 
about  in  sheepskins  and  goatskins;  being  destitute,  af- 
flicted, tormented; 

(Of  whom  the  world  was  not  worthy:)  they  wan- 
dered in  deserts,  and  in  mountains,  and  in  dens  and 
caves  of  the  earth. 

And  these  all,  having  obtained  a  good  report  through 
faith,  received  not  the  promise: 

God  having  provided  some  better  thing  for  us,  that 
they  without  us  should  not  be  made  perfect. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (1:43  to  end) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  went  forth  into  Galilee,   and 
findeth  Philip,  and  saith  unto  him:  Follow  me. 
Now  Philip  was  of  Bethsaida,  the  city  of  Andrew 
and  Peter. 

Philip  findeth  Nathanael,  and  saith  unto  him.  We 
have  found  him,  of  whom  Moses  in  the  law,  and  the 


The  First  Sunday  673 

prophets,  did  write,  Jesus  of  Nazareth,  the  son  of 
Joseph. 

And  Nathanael  said  unto  him,  Can  there  any  good 
thing  come  out  of  Nazareth?  Philip  saith  unto  him, 
Come  and  see. 

Jesus  saw  Nathanael  coming  to  him,  and  saith  of 
him,  Behold  an  Israelite  indeed,  in  whom  is  no  guile! 

Nathanael  saith  unto  him.  Whence  knowest  thou  me? 
Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  him.  Before  that  Philip 
called  thee,  when  thou  wast  under  the  fig  tree,  I  saw 
thee. 

Nathanael  answered  and  saith  unto  him.  Rabbi,  thou 
art  the  Son  of  God;  thou  art  the  King  of  Israel. 

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  him.  Because  I  said 
unto  thee,  I  saw  thee  under  the  fig  tree,  believest  thou? 
thou  shalt  see  greater  things  than  these. 

And  he  saith  unto  him.  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto 
you.  Hereafter  ye  shall  see  heaven  open,  and  the  angels 
of  God  ascending  and  descending  upon  the  Son  of  man.

and  clear  voice,  if  any  kneel  not  to  them  and  kiss  them 
anxiously  in  sign  of  veneration  to  their  original  ele- 
ments (not  the  kneeling  and  kissing  of  worship,  but 
considering  them  as  icons  representing  their  original 
elements,  not  as  gods),  then  let  him  be  anathema.  Then 
she  besought  God  asking  of  him  forgiveness  for  her 
husband,  praying  and  fasting  continually  for  the  whole 
first  week  of  the  Great  Fast.  Then  on  the  following 
Sunday,  having  offered  the  prescribed  prayers  and  peti- 
tions, along  with  her  son,  the  Emperor  Michael,  and 
with,  all  the  clergy  and  the  people,  she  hung  the  holy 
Icons,  adorning  therewith  the  Church  of  Christ  as 
formerly.  In  remembrance,  therefore,  of  this  holy  act, 
all  we  Orthodox  celebrate  this  glorious  and  brilliant 
day  as  the  Sunday  of  Orthodoxy. 

Wherefore,  O  uncreated  likeness  of  the  Father,

have  mercy  upon  us.    Amen.

Fourth  Tone. 

/^^RANT  me  reverence,  estrangement  from  evil,  and 
^^  perfect  discipline,  who  am  now  drowned  in  the 
passions  of  the  flesh,  estranged  from  thee,  and  entirely 
without  hope,  O  my  God,  King  of  all.  Save  me,  thy 
prodigal  son,  by  the  bounty  of  thy  goodness,  O  Jesus 
the  Almighty,  the  Saviour  of  our  souls. 


The  First  Sunday  Evening  675 

When  Moses  the  wonderful  was  purified  by  fasting, 
he  beheld  the  beloved  One.  Wherefore,  emulate  him, 
my  humble  soul,  and  hasten  to  be  purified  of  evils  on 
the  day  of  abstinence,  that  the  Lord  may  bestow  for- 
giveness on  thee,  and  that  thou  mayest  behold  him;  for 
he  is  the  Almighty,  the  good  Lord,  and  the  Lover  of 
mankind. 

Let  us,  O  brethren,  begin  the  second  week  of  the 
Fast,  fulfilling  it  day  by  day  with  rejoicing,  making 
unto  ourselves,  like  Elijah  the  Tishbite,  a  fiery  chariot 
of  the  great  cardinal  virtues,  elevating  our  minds  by 
subduing  our  passions,  arming  ourselves  with  purity, 
to  chase  away  and  vanquish  the  enemy.

lic what  we  accomplish  in  charity,  lest  the  left  hand 
know  what  the  right  hand  doeth,  and  vainglory  do  away 
with  the  fruit  of  alms.  Let  us,  however,  plead  secretly 
with  him  who  knoweth  our  secrets,  crying.  Father,  for-

Thou,  in  the  beginning,  O  Lord,  didst  found  the

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (2:1-12) 

A  T  that  time :  Jesus  entered  into  Capernaum  after 
some  days;  and  it  was  noised  that  he  was  in  the 
house. 

And  straightway  many  were  gathered  together,  in- 
somuch that  there  was  no  room  to  receive  them,  no,  not 
so  much  as  about  the  door:  and  he  preached  the  word 
unto  them. 

And  they  come  unto  him,  bringing  one  sick  of  the 
palsy,  which  was  borne  of  four. 

And  when  they  could  not  come  nigh  unto  him  for 
the  press,  they  uncovered  the  roof  where  he  was:  and 
when  they  had  broken  it  up,  they  let  down  the  bed 
wherein  the  sick  of  the  palsy  lay. 


The  Second  Sunday  679 

When  Jesus  saw  their  faith,  he  said  unto  the  sick  of 
the  palsy,  Son,  thy  sins  be  forgiven  thee. 

But  there  were  certain  of  the  scribes  sitting  there, 
and  reasoning  in  their  hearts, 

Why  doth  this  man  thus  speak  blasphemies?  who  can 
forgive  sins  but  God  only? 

And  immediately  when  Jesus  perceived  in  his  spirit 
that  they  so  reasoned  within  themselves,  he  said  unto 
them,  Why  reason  ye  these  things  in  your  hearts? 

Whether  is  it  easier  to  say  to  the  sick  of  the  palsy, 
Thy  sins  be  forgiven  thee;  or  to  say.  Arise,  and  take  up 
thy  bed,  and  walk? 

But  that  ye  may  know  that  the  Son  of  man  hath 
power  on  earth  to  forgive  sins,  (he  saith  to  the  sick  of 
the  palsy,) 

I  say  unto  thee.  Arise,  and  take  up  thy  bed,  and  go 
thy  way  into  thine  house. 

And  immediately  he  arose,  took  up  the  bed,  and  went 
forth  before  them  all;  insomuch  that  they  were  all 
amazed,  and  glorified  God,  saying.  We  never  saw  it  on 
this  fashion.

680  Triodion 

This  divine  Father  was  born  in  Asia  and  was  brought 
up  from  infancy  in  the  royal  palace  of  Constantinople, 
where  he  acquired  his  religious  and  secular  education. 
When  he  reached  the  age  of  youth  he  left  the  palace 
and  gave  himself  up  to  asceticism  in  the  holy  mount 
of  Athos  and  in  the  monastery  that  is  in  Beroea.  Then 
he  moved  to  the  city  of  Thessalonica  where  he  resided 
for  a  time  seeking  cure  from  the  diseases  that  he  con- 
tracted because  of  his  asceticism  and  piety.  He  also 
attended  the  two  Councils  held,  in  Constantinople,  the 
one  in  1341  against  Barlaam  the  Calabrian  and  the 
other  in  1347  against  Acyndinus  who  held  Barlaam's 
doctrine,  striving  valiantly  and  defending  the  Eastern 
Orthodox  doctrines  of  Christ.  In  1349  he  was  ele- 
vated to  be  Archbishop  of  Thessalonica,  tending  its  peo- 
ple in  an  apostolic  fashion  for  a  period  of  thirteen 
years,  resting  in  the  Lord  at  the  age  of  63,  having  writ- 
ten several  books.  His  venerable  bones  rest  in  the  Arch- 
bishopric of  Thessalonica  to  this  day.  As  for  the  songs 
chanted  in  the  service  of  his  Feast,  they  were  composed 
by  Patriarch  Philotheus  in  1368,  the  year  in  which  the 
celebration  of  his  Feast  was  renewed  on  this  day. 

Wherefore,  O  God,  by  his  intercessions  have  mercy 
upon  us  and  save  us.    Amen.

expect  unnumbered  punishments — the  gnashing  of 
teeth,  inconsolable  weeping,  the  fire  of  hell,  the  dark- 
ness and  Tartarus.  Wherefore,  O  righteous  Judge, 
grant  me  tears  wherewith  I  may  find  forgiveness  of  sins 
and  delivery  from  mine  iniquities,  that  fasting,  I  may 
cry  to  thee.  Have  compassion  on  me,  O  Christ  Lord, 
for  thy  great  and  rich  mercy.

of  my  evil  traits  have  been  put  far  away  from  thee. 
Revive  me  also,  dead,  and  purify  me  with  fasting  and 
constant  weeping  and  crying  to  thee,  O  Christ  Lord, 
have  compassion  on  me,  for  thy  rich  and  Great  Mercy.

^And  in  the  Einos,  four  for  the  Resurrection;  and  the  following, 
four  for  the  Cross,  in  the  Fourth   Tone. 

T  ET  US  rejoice  with  melodies  and  magnify  with 
praises  the  precious  Cross,  embracing  it  and  cry- 
ing to  it,  O  all-revered  Cross,  sanctify  our  souls  and 
bodies  by  thy  power,  and  keep  us  who  adore  thee  in 
true  worship  safe  from  the  sundry  harms  of  adversaries. 
{Repeat.) 

Come  ye,  and  take  to  drink  of  the  unfailing  waters 
from  the  rivers  of  the  bliss  of  the  Cross,  beholding 
prone  before  us  the  holy  Tree,  the  fountain  of  gifts, 
watered  with  blood  and  water,  flowing  from  the  Lord 
of  all,  who  was  elevated  thereon  by  his  own  will,  and 
therewith  elevated  mankind. 

Thou  art,  O  all-revered  Cross,  the  pillar  of  the 
Church,  the  confirmation  of  kings,  the  pride  of  ascetics, 
and  their  salvation.  Wherefore,  we  adore  thee,  and 
seek  illumination  from  thee  with  our  hearts  and  souls 
by  the  divine  grace  of  him  who  was  stretched  on  thee, 
who  demolished  the  power  of  the  deceiver  and  abol- 
ished the  curse. 

Glory,  in  the  Kighth  Tone 

'  I  ^HE  Lord  of  all  taught  us  by  a  proverb  to  run  away 
from  the  haughtiness  of  the  evil  Pharisees;  and  in- 
structed all  not  to  exalt  themselves  in  their  opinions 
from  duty,  having  himself  become  a  Symbol  and  an 
Exemplar,  emptying  himself  unto  the  Cross  and  death. 
Wherefore,  with  the  publican,  let  us  ofifer  him  thanks, 
saying,  O  thou  who  didst  sufifer  for  our  sakes  and  re- 
mained an  unsufTering  God,  deliver  us  from  sufferings 
and  save  our  souls.

The  Epistle:  Prokeimenon  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

Save,  O  Lord,  thy  people,  and  bless  thine  inheritance. 
Unto  thee  will  I  cry,  O  Lord,  O  my  God. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 
(4:14  to  end;  5:1-6) 

XT'E  brethren:  Having  therefore  a  great  high  priest, 
that  hath  passed  into  the  heavens,  Jesus  the  Son  of 
God;  let  us  hold  fast  our  confession. 

For  we  have  not  an  high  priest  which  cannot  be 
touched  with  the  feeling  of  our  infirmities;  but  was  in 
all  points  tempted  like  as  we  are,  yet  without  sin. 

Let  us  therefore  come  boldly  unto  the  throne  of 
grace,  that  we  may  obtain  mercy,  and  find  grace  to 
help  in  time  of  need. 

For  every  high  priest  taken  from  among  men  is  or- 
dained for  men  in  things  pertaining  to  God,  that  he 
may  offer  both  gifts  and  sacrifices  for  sins: 

Who  can  have  compassion  on  the  ignorant,  and  on 
them  that  are  out  of  the  way;  for  that  he  himself  also 
is  compassed  with  infirmity. 


The  Third  Sunday  687 

And  by  reason  hereof  he  ought,  as  for  the  people,  so 
also  for  himself,  to  offer  for  sins. 

And  no  man  taketh  this  honour  unto  himself,  but  he 
that  is  called  of  God,  as  was  Aaron. 

So  also  Christ  glorified  not  himself  to  be  made  a 
high  priest;  but  he  that  said  unto  him.  Thou  art  my 
Son,  to-day  have  I  begotten  thee. 

As  he  saith  also  in  another  place,  Thou  art  a  priest 
for  ever  after  the  order  of  Melchisedec. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (8:34  to  end;  9:1) 

npHE  Lord  saith :  Whosoever  will  come  after  me,  let 
him  deny  himself,  and  take  up  his  cross,  and  follow 
me. 

For  whosoever  will  save  his  life  shall  lose  it;  but 
whosoever  shall  lose  his  life  for  my  sake  and  the  gos- 
pel's, the  same  shall  save  it. 

For  what  shall  it  profit  a  man,  if  he  shall  gain  the 
whole  world,  and  lose  his  own  soul? 

Or  what  shall  a  man  give  in  exchange  for  his  soul? 

Whosoever  therefore  shall  be  ashamed  of  me  and  of 
my  words  in  this  adulterous  and  sinful  generation,  of 
him  also  shall  the  Son  of  man  be  ashamed,  when  he 
Cometh  in  the  glory  of  his  Father  with  the  holy  angels. 

And  he  said  unto  them.  Verily  I  say  unto  you.  That 
there  be  some  of  them  that  stand  here,  which  shall  not 
taste  of  death,  till  they  have  seen  the  kingdom  of  God 
come  with  power.

688  Triodion 

/^N  which  we  feast  for  the  life-giving  and  precious 
Cross. 

Every  hard  and  strenuous  work  is  accomplished  with 
great  difficulty,  which  appears  especially  in  the  middle 
of  such  work;  for  the  effort  expended  in  this  perform- 
ance brings  with  it  fatigue  which  makes  the  accomplish- 
ment of  the  rest  very  hard.  Having,  therefore,  arrived 
with  God's  grace,  at  the  middle  of  the  Fast,  and  being 
undoubtedly  overcome  by  fatigue  and  increasing  diffi- 
culties, our  compassionate  mother,  the  holy  Church  of 
Christ,  thought  fit  to  reveal  to  us  the  holy  Cross  as  the 
joy  of  the  world,  power  of  the  faithful,  bulwark  of 
the  piou5,  hope  of  sinners,  a  sure  foundation,  and  a 
secure  help.  And  having  kissed  it  piously,  we  shall 
receive  grace  and  power  which  will  help  us  to  carry 
on  the  struggles  of  the  divine  Fast. 

Wherefore,  through  its  power,  O  Christ  God,  pro- 
tect us  against  the  harm  of  the  deceitful  one,  and  make 
us  worthy  to  traverse  safely  the  battle-ground  of  Quad- 
ragesima, and  to  adore  thy  divine  Passion  and  thy  life- 
giving  Resurrection;  and  have  mercy  upon  us;  for  thou 
alone  art  the  Lover  of  mankind.

Christ  was  crucified  in  the  flesh,  with  the  world  adoring 
it  and  being  lighted  therewith,  crying,  O  the  power  of 
the  Cross,  which  when  Satans  behold  they  are  burned, 
and  by  its  sign  it  is  revealed  consuming  them  with 
flames.  Wherefore,  I  bless  thee,  O  pure  Tree,  honour 
and  adore  thee  with  fear,  glorifying  God  who  granted 
me  through  thee  unending  life.

the  Gospel  and  forsook  the  world,  riches,  and

The  Fourth  Sunday  691 

The  Epistle:  Prokeimenon  in  the  Seventh  Tone 

The  Lord  will  give  strength  to  his  people.  The  Lord 
will  bless  his  people  with  peace. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Hebrews 
(6:13  to  end) 

VT'E  brethren:  When  God  made  promise  to  Abraham, 
because  he  could  swear  by  no  greater,  he  sware  by 
himself. 

Saying,  Surely  blessing  I  will  bless  thee,  and  multi- 
plying I  will  multiply  thee. 

And  so,  after  he  had  patiently  endured,  he  obtained 
the  promise. 

For  men  verily  swear  by  the  greater :  and  an  oath  for 
confirmation  is  to  them  an  end  of  all  strife. 

Wherein  God,  willing  more  abundantly  to  show  unto 
the  heirs  of  promise  the  immutability  of  his  counsel, 
confirmed  it  by  an  oath : 

That  by  two  immutable  things  in  which  it  was  im- 
possible for  God  to  lie,  we  might  have  a  strong  con- 
solation, who  have  fled  for  refuge  to  lay  hold  upon  the 
hope  set  before  us: 

Which  hope  we  have  as  an  anchor  of  the  soul,  both 
sure  and  steadfast,  and  which  entereth  into  that  within 
the  veil; 

Whither  the  forerunner  is  for  us  entered,  even  Jesus, 
made  an  high  priest  for  ever  after  the  order  of  Mel- 
chisedec. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (9:16-30) 

AT  that  time:  One  of  the  multitude  came  forth  to 
Jesus,  bowing  down  and  saying  unto  him:  Master, 
I  have  brought  unto  thee  my  son,  which  hath  a  dumb 
spirit: 

And  wheresoever  he  taketh  him,  he  teareth  him;  and 
he  foameth,  and  gnasheth  with  his  teeth,  and  pineth 
away:  and  I  spake  to  thy  disciples  that  they  should  cast 
him  out;  and  they  could  not. 


692  Triodion 

He  answereth  him,  and  saith,  O  faithless  generation, 
how  long  shall  I  be  with  you?  how  long  shall  I  suffer 
you?  bring  him  unto  me. 

And  they  brought  him  unto  him:  and  when  he  saw 
him,  straightway  the  spirit  tare  him;  and  he  fell  on  the 
ground,  and  wallowed  foaming. 

And  he  asked  his  father,  How  long  is  it  ago  since 
this  came  unto  him?    And  he  said.  Of  a  child. 

And  ofttimes  it  hath  cast  him  into  the  fire,  and  into 
the  waters,  to  destroy  him:  but  if  thou  canst  do  any 
thing,  have  compassion  on  us,  and  help  us. 

Jesus  said  unto  him.  If  thou  canst  believe,  all  things 
are  possible  to  him  that  believeth. 

And  straightway  the  father  of  the  child  cried  out, 
and  said  with  tears,  Lord,  I  believe;  help  thou  mine 
unbelief. 

When  Jesus  saw  that  the  people  came  running  to- 
gether, he  rebuked  the  foul  spirit,  saying  unto  him. 
Thou  dumb  and  deaf  spirit,  I  charge  thee,  come  out  of 
him,  and  enter  no  more  into  him. 

And  the  spirit  cried,  and  rent  him  sore,  and  came  out 
of  him:  and  he  was  as  one  dead;  insomuch  that  many 
said.  He  is  dead. 

But  Jesus  took  him  by  the  hand,  and  lifted  him  up; 
and  he  arose. 

And  when  he  was  come  into  the  house,  his  disciples 
asked  him  privately.  Why  could  not  we  cast  him  out? 

And  he  said  unto  them,  This  kind  can  come  forth  by 
nothing,  but  by  prayer  and  fasting. 

And  they  departed  thence,  and  passed  through  Gali- 
lee; and  he  would  not  that  any  man  should  know  it. 

For  he  taught  his  disciples,  and  said  unto  them,  The 
Son  of  man  is  delivered  into  the  hands  of  men,  and  they 
shall  kill  him;  and  after  that  he  is  killed,  he  shall  rise 
the  third  day.

First  Ode  J  in  the  Sixth  Tone — Hermos 

A  HELP  and  a  refuge  hath  salvation  become  to  me. 
This  is  my  God,  therefore,  I  will  glorify  him;  the 
God  of  my  Fathers,  therefore,  will  I  exalt  him;  for 
in  glory  hath  he  been  glorified. 

Where,  O  Christ,  shall  I  begin  to  mourn  the  deeds  of 
my  miserable  life-time?  And  what  beginning  shall  I 
make  to  the  present  mourning?  But  since  thou  art  com- 
passionate, grant  me  forgiveness  of  sins. 

Come,  O  wretched  soul,  with  thy  body,  and  confess 
before  the  Creator  of  all.  Refrain  from  thy  former 
bestiality,  and  offer  to  God  tears  with  repentance. 

I  have  emulated  in  iniquity  Adam  the  first  creation, 
and  found  myself  stripped  naked  of  God  and  of  eternal 
kingship  and  bliss  because  of  my  sins. 

Woe  is  me,  O  wretched  soul,  why  didst  thou  resem- 
ble the  first  Eve?  Because  thou  didst  cast  an  evil  look 
and  boldly  tasted  the  forbidden  food. 

Glory:  O  transubstantial  Trinity,  worshipped  in 
unity,  lift  from  me  the  heavy  shackles  of  sin,  and  grant 
me  (for  thou  art  compassionate)  tears  of  reverence. 

Now:  O  Theotokos,  hope  and  intercessor  of  those 
who  praise  thee,  lift  from  me  the  shackles  of  sin.  And 
since  thou  art  an  undefiled  Lady,  receive  me  repentant. 

Second  Ode — Hermos 

Hearken,  O  heaven,  and  I  will  speak;  and  I  will 
praise  Christ  who  was  offered  in  the  flesh  from  the 
Virgin. 

Hearken,  O  heaven,  and  I  will  speak.  Give  ear,  O 
earth,  to  the  voice  of  a  penitent  who  praiseth  God. 

Turn  to  me  with  thy  merciful  sight  and  save  me,  my 
God  and  my  Saviour,  and  accept  my  most  fervid  con- 
fession. 

I  have  sinned  more  than  all  people.  I  alone  have 
sinned  against  thee.  But  as  God,  have  compassion  on 
thy  work,  O  Saviour. 


696  Triodion 

I  have  painted  the  ugliness  of  my  passions  with  the 
surging  love  of  pleasure,  marring  the  comeliness  of  my 
mind. 

Glory:  I  praise  thee,  God  of  all,  the  One  in  three 
Persons,  the  Father,  Son  and  Holy  Spirit. 

Now:  O  pure  Theotokos,  alone  all-praised,  plead 
constantly  for  our  salvation. 


Third  Ode — Hermos 

PSTABLISH  thy  Church,  O  Christ,  on  the  unshake- 
^^  able  rock  of  thy  commandments. 

The  Lord,  O  my  soul,  in  the  beginning,  rained  fire 
from  above  and  burned  the  land  of  the  Sodomites. 

Escape,  O  my  soul,  to  the  mount,  like  Lot.  Run 
ahead  to  Zoar  and  be  saved. 

Run,  O  my  soul,  from  the  blaze.  Run  from  the  flame 
of  Sodom,  and  escape  from  the  destruction  of  the  godly 
fire. 

Unto  thee  have  I  sinned.  I  alone  have  sinned  more 
than  all.    Forget  me  not,  O  Christ  Saviour. 

Glory:  O  Trinity,  the  one  God,  save  us  from  error, 
temptation,  and  tribulation. 

Now:  Rejoice,  O  God-receiving  belly.  Rejoice,  O 
throne  of  the  Lord.    Rejoice,  O  Mother  of  our  life. 

Fourth  Ode — Hermos 

npHE  prophet  heard  of  thy  coming,  O  Lord,  and  that 
^  thou  w^ast  about  to  be  born  of  the  Virgin  and  appear 
to  men,  and  he  vs^as  dismayed,  crying.  Thy  hearing  have 
I  heard,  and  I  feared.  Glory  to  thy  power,  O  Lord. 
O  Righteous  Judge  and  Lover  of  mankind,  forsake 
not  thy  works,  and  turn  not  away  from  thy  creation, 
even  though  I  alone  have  sinned  as  man,  exceeding  all 
men.  But  since  thou  art  Lord  of  all,  thou  hast  power 
to  forgive  sins. 


Thursday  of  Fifth  Week  697 

Thy  end  hath  come,  and  thy  departure  draweth  near; 
nor  hast  thou  shown  concern  or  prepared.  Life  passeth 
away,  arise.  The  Judge  is  near  at  the  doors.  The  time 
of  life  passeth  like  a  dream  and  like  flowers.  Why  are 
we  troubled  in  vain? 

Arise,  my  soul,  and  review  thy  deeds  which  have  pro- 
ceeded from  thee.  Scrutinize  them  closely,  and  shed 
the  rain  of  thy  tears,  declaring  openly  to  Christ  thy 
thoughts  and  deeds,  that  thou  mayest  be  justified. 

There  hath  never  been  a  sin  in  the  world,  O  Saviour, 
no  deed  of  iniquity,  that  I  have  not  committed,  sinning 
in  thought,  word,  and  intention;  in  plan,  determination, 
and  action,  as  no  one  else  hath  done. 

Glory:  I  speak  of  thy  Godhead,  that  thou  art  indi- 
visible, in  Persons  immiscible;  that  the  one  triune  Di- 
vinity is  coequal  in  kingship  and  rank.  I  hail  thee  with 
the  great  three-fold  song  of  praise  with  which  thou  art 
praised  above. 

Now:  Thou  didst  give  birth  being  a  Virgin,  and  re- 
mained in  both  states  unwed  by  nature.  The  Begotten 
renewed  the  law  of  nature,  and  the  womb  gave  birth 
without  travailing;  for  when  God  willeth,  he  overcom- 
eth  the  law  of  nature;  for  he  doeth  what  he  willeth. 

Fifth  Ode — Hermos 

TN  the  night  I  rise  up  early,  beseeching  thee,  O  Lover 

of  mankind.  Lighten  me  and  guide  me  in  thy  com- 
mandments.   Teach  me,  O  Saviour,  to  do  thy  will. 

I  have  passed  all  my  life  in  darkness;  for  the  night  of 
sin  hath  brought  me  darkness  and  dense  fog.  But  since 
thou  art  the  Saviour,  make  me  manifest  as  a  son  of  the 
day. 

I,  wretched  man,  have  rivalled  Reuben,  forming  an 
opinion  transgressing  the  law  and  the  high  God.  I 
have  defiled  my  bed,  as  he  defiled  his  father's  bed. 

O  Christ  king,  to  thee  I  confess.  I  have  sinned 
against  thee,  and  erred,  having  sold  the  fruit  of  purity 
and  chastity  as  the  brothers  of  Joseph  of  old  sold  him. 


698  Triodion 

His  soul  was  bartered  by  his  brothers,  and  that  sweet 
lad  was  delivered  into  bondage,  an  example  of  the  Lord. 
Thou,  O  soul,  wast  sold  in  thine  entirety  to  thine  evil 
deeds. 

Glory:  Thee  we  glorify,  O  one  God,  Trinity.  Holy! 
Holy!  Holy  art  thou,  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit, 
simple  and  single  Essence  worshipped  everlastingly. 

Now:  O  Mother  Virgin,  who  hath  not  known  wed- 
lock, from  thee  God,  Creator  of  all  the  ages,  did  put 
on  my  creation,  uniting  in  himself  human  nature. 

Sixth  Ode — Hermos 

V)l/^ITH  my  whole  heart  I  cried  unto  the  compassion- 
ate God,  and  he  heard  me  from  the  nether  hades, 
bringing  my  life  out  of  corruption. 

To  thee  I  offer  with  purity,  with  the  tears  of  mine 
eyes,  with  sighs  from  the  depth,  and  with  shouting  of 
the  heart.  Against  thee  have  I  sinned,  O  God.  For- 
give thou  me. 

Thou  didst  revolt  against  thy  Lord,  O  my  soul,  as  did 
Dathan  and  Abiram.  Wherefore,  lest  the  hades  of 
earth  open  and  swallow  thee,  cry  from  the  nether  hades; 
Pity  thou  me. 

Thou  hast  become  like  Ephraim,  O  my  soul,  like  a 
runaway  calf.  Deliver  thy  life,  winged  with  action,  in- 
telligence and  vision,  like  a  deer,  from  the  noose. 

The  hand  of  Moses,  O  my  soul,  did  demonstrate  how 
God  can  whiten  thy  leprous  conduct  and  purify  it.  Be 
not  dismayed  at  thyself,  though  afflicted  with  leprosy. 

Glory:  The  Father,  Son,  and  Divine  Spirit  saith,  I 
am  a  simple,  indivisible  Trinity,  varied  in  Countenance, 
and  One  in  united  Nature. 

Now:  Thy  womb,  O  Theotokos,  hath  borne  us  a 
God,  formed  like  us.  Wherefore,  since  he  is  Creator 
of  all,  implore  him  that  we  be  justified  by  thine  inter- 
cessions. 

^Tlien  slowly  sing  the  following  Kontakion,  in  the  Sixth  Tone. 


Thursday  of  Fifth  Week  699 

7\/TY  SOUL,  O  my  soul,  arise.  How  long  wouldest 
^  thou  sleep?  Thine  end  draweth  near,  and  thou 
art  about  to  be  disturbed.  Awake,  therefore,  that  Christ 
may  have  compassion  on  thee,  God  present  in  every 
place  and  filling  all. 

Synaxarion 

On  This  Day,  Which  is  the  Thursday  of  the 
Fifth  Week  of  the  Fast,  We  Sing  According  to 
THE  Old  Tradition,  the  Order  of  the  Great  Canon. 

Stichos 

Verily,  Jesus,  I  will  now  sing  unto  thee  the 
Great  Canon  ;  grant  thou  me  tears  of  contrition 
and  awe. 

IN  which  we  chant  the  Service  of  the  Great  Canon. 

This  reverential  Canon,  which  is  called  Great,  not 
only  because  of  the  large  number  of  Troparia  used 
therein  as  compared  with  other  Canons,  but  also  be- 
cause of  the  sublime  symbolical  allusions  it  contains 
and  pious  references,  was  composed  after  this  ToneJ  and 
perfected  by  Andrew,  the  Archbishop  of  Crete  (See 
July  fourth)  who  included  in  it  quotations  from  the 
Old  and  New  Testaments  of  the  Holy  Bible.  In  this 
Canon  the  author  urges  all  souls  to  imitate  good  deeds 
and  to  shun  evil  ones,  and  to  return  to  God  through 
repentance. 

Wherefore,  through  the  intercessions  of  St.  Andrew, 
have  mercy  upon  us,  and  save  us.    Amen. 

Seventh  Ode — Hermos 

\X7E  have  sinned,  and  done  iniquity  and  injustice  be- 
fore  thee.    We  have  not  kept  nor  done  what  thou 
didst  command  us.    But  deliver  us  not  unto  the  end,  O 
God  of  our  Fathers. 

I  have  erred  and  sinned  and  transgressed  thy  com- 
mandment; for  I  have  gone  too  far  in  my  sins,  and 


700  Triodion 

brought  on  ulcerous  wounds.  But  since  thou  art  com- 
passionate, have  mercy  upon  me,  O  God  of  our  Fathers. 

To  thee  I  confess  the  secrets  of  my  heart,  O  my  Judge. 
Look  down  upon  my  humility,  behold  my  sorrow  and 
listen  now  to  my  complaints.  And  since  thou  art  com- 
passi'onate,  have  mercy  upon'me,  O  God  of  our  Fathers. 

When  Saul  lost  for  a  time  his  father's  asses,  he  found 
a  kingdom,  and  came  to  be  called  a  king  without  intent. 
But  see  that  thou  prefer  not  unwittingly  thy  bestial  de- 
sires to  the  kingdom  of  Christ. 

0  my  soul,  David,  the  father  of  God,  sinned  doubly, 
having  been  pierced  with  the  arrow  of  adultery,  and 
stabbed  with  the  spear  of  murderous  crime.  Thou  art 
yet  laid  low  with  a  sickness  more  onerous  to  the  stir- 
rings of  thine  energy. 

Glory:  O  thou  simple  and  indivisible  Trinity,  holy 
Unity,  consubstantial,  triune  God,  praised  as  light  and 
as  lights,  holy  One  and  Three.  Praise  thou,  my  soul, 
and  glorify  the  God  of  all,  who  is  Life  and  lives. 

Now:  We  praise  thee,  O  Theotokos,  bless  thee,  and 
adore  thee;  for  thou  didst  bear  One  of  the  Trinity,  in- 
divisible as  Son  and  God,  opening  the  heavens  to  us 
earthly  men. 

Eighth  Ode — Hermos 

pRAISE,  O  creation,  with  every  breath,  and  bless 
^  him  whom  the  hosts  of  heaven  do  glorify,  and  whom 
the  cherubim  and  seraphim  dread.  Exalt  him  yet  more 
unto  all  the  ages. 

1  have  erred,  O  Saviour;  have  mercy  upon  me. 
Awaken  my  mind  to  thy  return,  receive  me  and  have 
compassion  on  me,  as  I  cry  to  thee.  Against  thee  only 
have  I  sinned  and  done  evil.  Have  mercy  upon  me, 
and  save  me. 

Elijah  who  rode  in  the  chariot,  having  alighted  on 
the  chariot  of  virtues  for  a  time,  was  exalted  above 
earthly  things.  Contemplate,  then,  O  my  soul,  his  as- 
cension. 


Thursday  of  the  Fifth  Week  701 

And  Elisha,  having  for  a  time  received  Elijah's 
mantle,  received  from  the  Lord  double  grace.  But 
thou,  O  my  soul,  hast  not  shared  this  grace  because  of 
thy  wastefulness. 

The  flow  of  the  Jordan  ceased  on  either  side  by 
Elijah's  mantle  in  the  hands  of  Elisha.  But  thou,  O  my 
soul,  hast  not  shared  this  grace  because  of  thy  waste- 
fulness. 

We  bless  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit. 

0  eternal  Father,  and  Son  coeternal  with  him,  and 
the  comforting  Spirit,  upright  and  good;  O  Father  of 
God  the  Word;  O  Word  of  the  eternal  Father;  O  liv- 
ing, creating  Spirit,  one  Trinity,  have  mercy  upon  me. 

Now:  The  supersensual  purple  of  Immanuel,  O 
undefiled  one,  which  is  the  flesh,  was  woven  in  thy 
womb,  inwardly,  as  of  the  dye  of  a  royal  robe.  Where- 
fore, since  thou  art  in  truth  the  Theotokos,  we  honour 
thee. 

Ninth  Ode — Hermos 

\/ERILY,  the  Nativity,  is  ineffable;  for  the  Concep- 
tion was  without  seed  and  without  the  corruption 
of  a  spouseless  Mother;  for  the  Nativity  of  God  hath 
renewed  nature.  Wherefore,  with  steadfast  faith  all 
generations  magnify  thee;  for  thou  art  the  Mother  of 
our  God. 

Lo!  the  mind  is  wounded  and  the  body  is  weak;  the 
spirit  is  ill  and  speech  is  powerless;  life  hath  been  mor- 
tified and  the  end  is  at  the  door.  What,  then,  shalt 
thou  do,  wretched  soul,  when  the  Judge  cometh  to 
examine  thine  affairs? 

1  have  adduced  to  thee,  O  my  soul,  how  the  world 
spoken  of  by  Moses,  and  every  canonical  book  there- 
from, chronicleth  to  thee  all  the  just  and  the  unjust. 
But  thou  didst  not  resemble  the  former,  but  rather  emu- 
lated the  latter,  having  erred  against  God. 

The  law  hath  become  weak,  the  Gospel  hath  been 
abolished,  and  every  book  hath  been  neglected  by  thee. 


702  Triodion 

The  Prophets  have  tired,  and  the  speech  of  every  one 
that  is  righteous.  But  thy  wounds  have  multiplied,  O 
my  soul,  where  there  is  no  physician  to  heal  thee. 

I  have  produced  for  thee  all  the  examples  of  the 
New  Book  to  guide  thee  to  reverence.  Emulate,  then, 
the  righteous,  and  avoid  the  sinful.  Beseech  Christ 
with  prayers,  fastings,  purity,  and  reverence. 

O  righteous  Mary  the  Egyptian,  intercede  for  us. 

O  righteous  Mother,  implore  the  Creator  for  us  who 
honour  thee;  that  we  may  escape  the  distresses  and  sor- 
rows that  surround  us;  that  being  saved  from  tempta- 
tions we  may  ceaselessly  magnify  the  Lord  who  hath 
magnified  thee. 

O  Saint  of  God,  Andrew,  intercede  for  us. 

O  venerable  Andrew,  the  thrice-blessed  Father,  shep- 
herd of  Crete,  cease  not  to  plead  for  us  who  praise  thee, 
that  we  may  be  delivered  from  every  abomination,  sor- 
row, and  corruption,  and  be  saved  from  iniquities;  for 
we  honour  thy  memory  in  faith. 

Glory:  Let  us  glorify  the  Father,  exalt  the  Son,  and 
worship  in  faith  the  divine  Spirit,  the  indivisible  Trin- 
ity, one  in  Substance;  for  he  is  Light,  and  enlightens 
life,  and  lives,  enlivening  and  lighting  the  ends  of  tlie 
earth. 

Now:  O  Pure  Theotokos,  preserve  thy  city;  for  by 
thee  it  reigneth  in  faith,  by  thee  it  is  established,  by 
thee  it  conquereth,  by  thee  it  repulseth  every  distress, 
leadeth  captive  its  attackers,  and  protccteth  those  who 
submit  to  it. 

Saturday  of  the  Fifth  Week  of  the  Fast 

Service  of  Laudation  of  the  Akathiston  (in  which  no 
sitting  is  permitted)  for  the  Theotokos 

^On  Friday  evening  Little  Compline  is  recited  up  to  It  is  truly  meet, 
&tc.  Then  sing  twice  slowly,  and  once  quickly  the  following  Tro- 
parion,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 


Saturday  of  Fifth  Week  703 

nPHE  bodiless  having  learned  what  he  was  com- 
manded to  do  secretly,  hastened  towards  the  house 
of  Joseph,  saying  to  her  who  knew  no  wedlock.  Behold, 
he  to  whose  descent  the  heavens  did  bow,  shall 'be  alto- 
gether held  in  thee  without  transubstantiation.  As  I 
behold  him  in  thy  womb,  taking  the  likeness  of  a  ser- 
vant, I  become  amazed,  crying  to  thee.  Hail,  O  bride, 
who  hath  no  bridegroom. 

C^Then  the  stanzas  for  our  Lady  are  chanted,  and  at  each  stanza,  the 
fnlloiuing  Canon  is  sung. 

First  Stanza 

1.  The  archangel  was  sent  from  heaven  to  say  to  the 
Theotokos,  Rejoice.  And  when  he  saw  thee,  O  Lord, 
incarnate  with  unincarnate  voice,  he  was  amazed,  and 
stood,  crying  unto  her.  Rejoice,  O  recall  of  fallen 
Adam.  Rejoice,  O  deliverer  of  Eve  from  weeping  and 
mourning.  Rejoice,  O  height  inaccessible  to  the  eyes 
of  angels.  Rejoice;  for  thou  hast  become  a  throne  for 
the  King.  Rejoice;  for  thou  carriest  the  Almighty.  Re- 
joice, O  star  revealing  the  Sun.  Rejoice,  O  belly  of 
the  divine  Incarnation.  Rejoice,  O  thou  in  whom  crea- 
tion is  renewed.  Rejoice,  O  thou  in  whom  the  Creator 
hath  become  a  babe.  Rejoice,  O  bride  without  bride- 
groom. 

2.  When  the  saintly  one  saw  herself  in  utmost  purity, 
she  boldly  said  to  Gabriel,  Thy  strange  voice  appeareth 
to  me  hard  of  acceptance;  for  how  speakest  thou  of 
birthgiving  without  seed,  crying,  Alleluia. 

3.  The  Virgin  sought  to  know  the  unknowable,  and 
she  cried  unto  the  servant.  Tell  me,  how  is  it  possible 
for  a  son  to  be  born  from  a  pure  womb?  And  that  one 
answered  her  with  fear,  crying  thus,  Rejoice,  O  keeper 
of  the  mystery  of  ineffable  opinion.  Rejoice,  O  faith 
of  those  who  need  silence.  Rejoice,  O  preface  of  the 
miracles  of  Christ.  Rejoice,  O  h^ad  of  his  command- 
ments. Rejoice,  O  heavenly  ladder  on  which  God 
descended.     Rejoice,  O  bridge  transporting  those  on 


704  Triodion 

earth  to  heaven.  Rejoice,  O  wonder  of  the  angel,  great- 
ly renowned.  Rejoice,  O  wound  of  demons,  much 
mourned.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  didst  bear  the  ineffable 
Light.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  informed  no  one  how. 
Rejoice,  O  thou  who  dost  exceed  the  knowledge  of  the 
wise.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  dost  illuminate  the  minds 
of  the  faithful.    Rejoice,  O  bride  without  bridegroom. 

4.  The  power  of  the  most  High  overshadowed,  at 
the  Conception,  her  who  had  had  no  experience  of  mar- 
riage, revealing  her  fruitful  womb  as  a  delectable  field 
for  all  those  who  desire  to  reap  salvation,  as  they  sing, 
Allelulia. 

5.  With  the  God-bearing  belly,  Mary  hastened  to- 
wards Elizabeth.  And  at  once  when  that  one's  babe 
heard  the  salutation,  he  rejoiced;  and  with  running  as 
though  with  praises,  he  cried  aloud  to  the  Theotokos, 
Rejoice,  O  vine  of  a  branch  that  fadeth  not.  Rejoice, 
O  holder  of  an  incorruptible  Fruit.  Rejoice,  O  hus- 
bandry of  the  Husbandman  who  loveth  mankind.  Re- 
joice, O  thou  who  didst  cause  to  grow  the  Planter  of 
our  life.  Rejoice,  O  fruitful  field,  fertile  with  compas- 
sions. Rejoice,  O  table  carrying  the  Treasure  of  for- 
giveness. Rejoice,  because  thou  didst  grow  the  mea- 
dows of  bliss.  Rejoice,  because  thou  preparest  the 
Haven  of  souls.  Rejoice,  O  acceptable  fragrance  of 
intercession.  Rejoice,  O  forgiveness  of  all  the  world. 
Rejoice,  O  good-will  of  God  among  the  dead.  Rejoice, 
O  thou  who  art  their  favour  before  him.  Rejoice,  O 
bride  without  bridegroom. 

6.  When  Joseph  the  chaste  saw  thee,  unwed,  O 
blameless  one,  he  was  perplexed  and  amazed  because 
of  his  troubled  thoughts,  thinking  that  thou  hadst  com- 
mitted infidelity.  But  when  he  knew  that  thy  Concep- 
tion was  from  the  Holy  Spirit,  he  cried,  Alleluia. 

4lThen  sing  the  following  Canon;  and  with  the  First  and  Second 
Troparia,  say,  O  most  holy  Theotokos,  save  us. 


Saturday  of  Fifth  Week  70S 

First  Ode,  in  the  Fourth  Tone — Hermos 

/^PEN  my  mouth  and  it  shall  be  filled  with  the 
Spirit;  and  I  shall  declare  a  saying  overflowing 
upon  the  Mother  Queen.  I  shall  show  forth,  celebrat- 
ing the  season  with  rejoicing,  and  shall  sing  her  won- 
ders with  gladness. 

When  the  great  archangel  saw,  O  pure  one,  that 
thou  art  a  living  scroll  of  Christ,  sealed  with  the  Spirit, 
he  shouted  unto  thee,  saying.  Rejoice,  O  dwelling-place 
of  joy  and  pleasure;  O  thou  in  whom  the  curse  of  the 
first  mother  is  undone. 

Rejoice,  O  virgin  bride  of  God.  Rejoice,  O  refor- 
mation of  Adam  and  his  correction.  Rejoice,  O  thou 
who  didst  cause  hades  to  die.  Rejoice,  O  all-blameless 
one.  Rejoice,  O  palace  of  the  only  King.  Rejoice,  O 
fiery  throne  of  the  Almighty. 

Glory:  Hail,  O  thou  who  alone  didst  sprout  the  fade- 
less Rose.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  didst  bear  the  fragrant 
Apple  for  the  nostrils  of  the  King  of  all.  Rejoice,  O 
thou  who  knew  no  wedlock.  Hail,  O  salvation  of  the 
world. 

Now:  Rejoice,  O  treasure  of  purity.  Rejoice,  O  thou 
through  whom  we  rose  from  our  fall.  Rejoice,  O  Lady, 
thou  lily  delicate  to  smell,  perfuming  the  faithful,  a 
sweet-scented  incense,  and  ointment  of  great  price. 

Third  Ode-Hermos

of  glory  and  honour. 

Rejoice,  O  Lady,  who  didst  clearly  sprout  the  divine 
Ear,  like  an  untilled  field.  Rejoice,  O  living  table  that 
hath  held  the  Bread  of  life.  Rejoice,  O  unfailing  foun-

7.  The  shepherds  heard  the  angels  praise  the  pres- 
ence of  Christ  in  the  flesh.  They  hastened  as  unto  a 
shepherd,  and  they  beheld  him  as  a  blameless  lamb 
grazing  on  Mary's  bosom;  and  they  praised  her,  say-

proachable, rejoicing,  they  shouted.  Alleluia.

9.  When  the  Chaldean  youths  saw  in  the  hands  of 
the  Virgin  him  who  created  man  with  his  own  hands, 
and  knew  that  he  was  the  Master,  albeit  he  had  taken 
on  the  likeness  of  a  servant,  they  hastened  with  pres-

O  Mother  of  the  never-setting  Star.  Rejoice,  O  mys- 
tical dawn  of  the  Day.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  didst 
quench  the  furnace  of  error.  Rejoice,  O  lighthouse  of 
the  initiates  of  the  Trinity.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  ex- 
pelled the  inhuman  usurper  from  his  chieftancy.  Re-

they  returned  to  Babylon,  having  fulfilled  thine  inspira- 
tion and  preached  unto  all  that  thou  art  Christ,  neglect- 
ing Herod  as  one  who  prateth,  not  knowing  how  to  sing, 
Alleluia. 

1 1.  When  thou  didst  cause  the  Light  of  truth  to  rise 
in  Egypt,  thou  didst  expel  the  darkness  of  error;  for  its 
idols,  unable  to  stand  against  thy  might,  O  Saviour,  fell 
and  rolled  down.  And  they  who  were  saved  from  their 
worship  shouted  to  the  Theotokos,  saying,  Rejoice,  O 
source  of  humanity.  Rejoice,  O  downfall  of  Satans. 
Rejoice,  O  thou  who  didst  tread  down  the  error  of  de- 
ceit. Rejoice,  O  thou  who  didst  betray  the  deceit  of 
idols.  Rejoice,  O  sea  that  drowned  the  supersensuous 
Pharaoh.  Rejoice,  O  rock  that  satisfied  the  thirsty  for 
life.  Rejoice,  O  pillar  of  fire  guiding  those  who  are  in 
darkness.  Rejoice,  O  shelter  of  the  world,  more  spa- 
cious than  the  clouds.  Rejoice,  O  nourishment  in  place 
of  manna.  Rejoice,  O  servant  of  holy  bliss.  Rejoice,

present  life,  deceiving  age,  thou  wast  delivered  to  him

who  layeth  down  the  law,  who  remitteth  the  sins  of  all 
freely.  Rejoice,  O  incomprehensible  depth,  ineffable 
height.  Rejoice,  O  thou  who  knowest  no  wedlock, 
through  whom  we  have  been  deified. 

Now:  Thee  do  we  praise,  O  Virgin,  who  didst  plait

the  all-brilliant  chamber.  Rejoice;  O  rejoicing  of  the 
angels.  Peace  be  upon  thee,  O  help  of  those  who  seek 
thee  in  faith. 

Rejoice,  O  Lady,  the  chariot  of  fiery  likeness  for  the 
Word,  O  living  paradise,  holding  in  its  midst  the  Lord, 
the  Tree  of  life,  whose  sweetness  reviveth  those  who 
have  fallen  into  corruption,  if  they  partake  of  him  in 
faith. 

Glory :  We  who  have  been  confirmed  by  thy  power, 
shout  to  thee  in  faith,  saying,  Rejoice,  O  city  of  the 
King  of  all,  of  whom  were  sung  the  songs  of  praise, 
meet  to  be  heard  plainly,  the  mountain  not  cut  out. 
Hail,  O  utterly  fathomless  depth. 

Now:  Hail,  O  pure  one,  the  spacious  dwelling-place 
of  the  Word,  the  shell  that  produced  the  divine  Pearl.

13.  When  the  Creator  appeared  he  revealed  us, 
through  himself,  as  a  new  creation,  having  branched 
from  a  seedless  belly,  preserving  it  as  it  had  been  with- 
out corruption:  so  that,  having,  seen  this  miracle,  we

wast  able  to  give  birth  yet  remain  a  Virgin.  But  we

On  this  Day  Which  is  the  Saturday  of  the 
Fifth  Week  of  the  Fast,  We  Celebrate  the  Praise 
OF  OUR  Most  Holy  Lady,  the  Ever-virgin  Mary, 
DURING  Which  it  is  not  Permitted  to  Sit. 

Stichos 

The  city  in  thanksgiving  and  watchfulness 
doth  praise  her  who  upholdeth  and  constantly 
watcheth  in  war-time,  giving  the  victory. 

TN  which  we  chant  the  praise  of  the  most  holy  Theo- 
tokos,  and  throughout  which  it  is  not  permitted  to 
sit. 

In  the  year  620  of  Christ,  the  Persians  from  the  east 
and  the  Arians,  a  tribe  of  the  Scythians  from  the  west, 
attacked  the  imperial  city  of  Constantinople  with  great 
armies  to  besiege  and  occupy  it.  King  Heracles  was 
then  absent,  and  the  invaders  filled  the  sea,  particularly 
the  Gulf  of  Constantinople  (which  is  known  to  the 
Turks  as  Iwan  Serai  Qabusi)  with  their  ships,  and  the 
land  with  their  infantry, cavalry, and  military  machines, 
making  ready  to  attack.  With  valour  and  perseverance 
the  inhabitants  held  back  the  enemy,  but  being  greatly 
outnumbered  and  unable  to  cope  with  such  a  great  force, 
they  surrendered  to  despair,  and  all  hope  of  delivery 
was  gone.  Then  they  sought  refuge  in  the  Theotokos, 
asking  succour  and  protection.  Suddenly,  a  violent 
tempest  broke  out  in  which  the  ships  of  the  enemy  were 
wrecked,  sinking  with  all  on  board.    The  waves  flung 


Saturday  of  Fifth  Week  713 

the  bodies  of  the  drowned  Barbarians  in  front  of  the 
Church  of  the  Theotokos  in  the  suburb  of  Blachernae 
(See  July  second).  When  the  people  saw  this,  they 
gained  courage,  went  out,  and  expelled  the  remaining 
soldiers,  who  fled  in  fear.  In  the  evening,  the  people 
gathered  in  the  Church  of  the  Theotokos,  and  spent  the 
whole  night,  standing,  thanking  her  and  praising  her 
with  the  cantons  of  the  Canon  known  as  Akathiston, 
during  which  it  is  not  permitted  to  sit.  In  remembrance 
of  this  miracle,  through  which  the  faithful  were  saved, 
we  celebrate  this  day,  glorifying  and  honouring  the 
Mother  of  our  Lord  and  God. 

As  for  the  twenty-four  verses  which  belong  to  this 
Canon,  and  which  we  recite  especially  on  this  day,  some 
assign  them  to  Sergius,  who  was  Patriarch  of  Constan- 
tinople at  that  time;  and  some  to  George  of  Pisidia, 
who  was  custodian  of  manuscripts  in  that  great  church, 
in  the  same  period.  A  poem  of  his  has  come  down  to  us 
with  the  title,  On  the  Barbarians'  Attack,  and  Their 
Failure,  which  is  an  Account  of  the  War  that  Occurred 
before  the  Walls  of  Constantinople,  between  the  Arians 
and  its  People. 

Wherefore,  through  the  intercessions  of  thy  combat- 
ting Mother  who  fighteth  not,  O  Christ  God,  deliver  us 
from  all  afflictions  that  encompass  us,  and  have  mercy 
upon  US;  for  thou  alone  art  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Seventh  Ode — Hermos 

nnHE   youths   of   godly  minds  worshipped   not  the 
creature  for  the  Creator,  but  trod  the  threat  of  fire 
bravely,  singing  joyfully,  O  thou  of  exceeding  praise, 
blessed  art  thou.  Lord  God  of  our  fathers. 

To  thee  we  lift  our  voices  with  songs  of  praise,  say- 
ing. Rejoice,  O  supersensual  chariot  of  the  Sun,  O  truth- 
ful vine  that  gave  fruit  to  the  ripe  cluster,  dripping 
with  wine  that  rejoiceth  the  souls  of  those  who  glorify 
thee  in  faith.

Rejoice,  O  bride  of  God  who  bore  the  Healer  of  man- 
kind. Rejoice,  O  mystical  rod  that  budded  the  fade- 
less Flower.  Rejoice,  O  thou  through  whom  we  are 
filled  with  joy,  and  inherit  life. 

The  tongues  of  eloquent  orators  fall  short  in  their 
ineptitude  to  discourse  of  thy  praises;  for  thou  hast  tran- 
scended the  seraphim  by  giving  birth  to  Christ  the 
King.  Wherefore,  implore  him  to  deliver  from  all 
harm  those  who  praise  thee  in  faith. 

Glory:  The  ends  of  the  earth  praise  thee,  O  pure 
one,  blessing  thee  and  crying  unto  thee.  Rejoice,  O 
scroll  on  which  the  Word  was  inscribed  by  God's  finger. 
Wherefore,  O  Theotokos,  implore  him  to  write  down 
thy  servants  in  the  Book  of  Life. 

Now:  We  thy  servants  implore  thee,  O  pure  Theo- 
tokos, and  our  hearts  bow  to  thee.  Wherefore,  turn 
thine  ear  to  us  and  save  us  who  are  drowned  in  sorrows. 
Keep  thy  city  from  all  the  surprises  of  the  enemy. 

Eighth  Ode — Hermos 

'  I  ^HE  birth-giving  of  the  Theotokos  kept  the  pure 
youths  in  the  furnace  safe,  this  having  been  so  fore- 
shadowed. But  now  that  it  hath  actually  been  accom- 
plished, it  moveth  all  the  universe  to  sing  aloud,  Praise 
the  Lord,  all  ye  his  works,  and  exalt  him  more  and 
more  unto  all  the  ages. 

Thou  didst  receive  the  Word  in  thy  womb,  O  pure 
one,  didst  bear  the  Almighty,  and  nourished  him  with 
milk,  and,  by  a  sign  from  him,  the  universe  also:  to 
whom  we  sing,  hailing.  Praise  the  Lord,  all  ye  his 
works,  and  exalt  him  more  and  more  unto  all  the  ages. 

Verily,  Moses,  O  holy  Virgin  free  of  corruption,  did 
comprehend  in  the  bush  the  mystery  of  thy  great  birth- 
giving.  And  the  youths  went  before  and  foreshadowed 
it  with  all  clearness  by  standing  in  the  midst  of  the  fire 
and  not  being  burned.  Wherefore,  we  praise  thee  unto 
all  the  ages.

darkness  of  downfalling  have  seen  the  Light.  Where- 
fore, we  praise  thee  unto  the  end  of  ages. 

Glory:  The  dead  by  thee  are  brought  to  life,  O  Vir- 
gin; for  thou  bore  the  life  of  one  Person;  and  those  who 
are  afRicted  in  their  speech  become  eloquent,  lepers  are 
purified,  diseases  are  driven  away,  and  all  the  spirits 
in  the  sky  are  vanquished,  defeated  by  thee,  O  salvation 
of  mankind. 

Now:  Rejoice,  O  all-blessed  pure  one,  who  gave 
birth  to  Salvation  for  the  world,  O  thou  through  whom 
we  have  ascended  from  earth  on  high.  Rejoice,  O  shel-

O  salvation  of  us  who  believe. 

Now:  Have  pity,  O  God,  on  thine  inheritance;  and 
overlook  now  all  our  sins,  since  there  is  one  who  plead- 
eth  with  thee,  she  who  gave  thee  birth  on  earth  without 
seed,  when,  by  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies,  thou  willed 
to  be  in  the  likeness  of  a  stranger,  O  Christ.

kindled  the  immaterial  Light.  Wherefore,  she  leadeth 
all  to  divine  knowledge,  and  lighteth  the  mind  with

ness is  mixed.  Rejoice,  O  fragrance  of  Christ.  Rejoice, 
O  life  of  the  mystical  banquet.  Rejoice,  O  bride  with- 
out bridegroom. 

22.  When  the  Remitter  of  the  debts  of  all  mankind 
wished  to  bestow  his  grace  of  the  remission  of  the  old 
debts,  he  came  of  himself  to  those  who  had  been  driven 
away  from  his  grace,  tearing  up  the  handwriting  of 
ordinances,  hearing  thus  from  all,  Allelulia. 

23.  Since  thou  art  a  living  temple,  O  Theotokos,  we 
all  praise  thee,  singing  to  thy  birth-giving;  for  God, 
who  holdeth  all  in  his  hand,  dwelt  in  thy  belly,  sancti- 
fying and  glorifying  thee,  and  teaching  all  to  hail  thee 
thus,  Rejoice,  O  saint  greater  than  all  saints.  Rejoice,

"Y^E  brethren:  When  Christ  came  an  high  priest  of 
^  good  things  to  come,  by  a  greater  and  more  perfect 
tabernacle,  not  made  with  hands,  that  is  to  say,  not  of 
this  creation: 

Neither  by  the  blood  of  goats  and  calves,  but  by  his 
own  blood  he  entered  in  once  into  the  holy  place,  hav- 
ing obtained  eternal  redemption  for  us. 

For  if  the  blood  of  bulls  and  of  goats,  and  the  ashes 
of  an  heifer  sprinkling  the  unclean,  sanctifieth  to  the 
purifying  of  the  flesh; 

How  much  more  shall  the  blood  of  Christ,  who 
through  the  eternal  Spirit  offered  himself  without  spot 
to  God,  purge  your  conscience  from  dead  works  to  serve 
the  living  God? 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (10:32-45) 

A  T  that  time :  Jesus  took  the  twelve  disciples  and 
began  to  tell  them  what  things  should  happen  unto 
him, 


722  Triodion 

Saying,  Behold,  we  go  up  to  Jerusalem;  and  the  Son 
of  man  shall  be  delivered  unto  the  chief  priests,  and 
unto  the  scribes;  and  they  shall  condemn  him  to  death, 
and  shall  deliver  him  to  the  Gentiles : 

And  they  shall  mock  him,  and  shall  scourge  him,  and 
shall  spit  upon  him,  and  shall  kill  him;  and  the  third 
day  he  shall  rise  again. 

And  James  and  John,  the  sons  of  Zebedee,  come  unto 
him,  saying.  Master,  we  would  that  thou  shouldest  do 
for  us  whatsover  we  shall  desire. 

And  he  said  unto  them.  What  would  ye  that  I  should 
do  for  you? 

They  said  unto  him.  Grant  unto  us  that  we  may  sit, 
one  on  thy  right  hand,  and  the  other  on  thy  left  hand, 
in  thy  glory. 

But  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Ye  know  not  what  ye  ask: 
can  ye  drink  of  the  cup  that  I  drink  of?  and  be  bap- 
tized with  the  baptism  that  I  am  baptized  with? 

And  they  said  unto  him.  We  can.  And  Jesus  said  unto 
them.  Ye  shall  indeed  drink  of  the  cup  that  I  drink  of; 
and  with  the  baptism  that  I  am  baptized  withal  shall 
ye  be  baptized : 

But  to  sit  on  my  right  hand  and  on  my  left  hand  is 
not  mine  to  give ;  but  it  shall  be  given  to  them  for  whom 
it  is  prepared. 

And  when  the  ten  heard  it,  they  began  to  be  much 
displeased  with  James  and  John. 

But  Jesus  called  them  to  him,  and  saith  unto  them, 
Ye  know  that  they  which  are  accounted  to  rule  over 
the  Gentiles  exercise  lordship  over  them;  and  their 
great  ones  exercise  authority  upon  them. 

But  so  shall  it  not  be  among  you :  but  whosoever  will 
be  great  among  you,  shall  be  your  minister: 

And  whosoever  of  you  will  be  the  chiefest,  shall  be 
servant  of  all. 

For  even  the  Son  of  man  came  not  to  be  ministered 
unto,  but  to  minister,  and  to  give  his  life  a  ransom  for 
many.

On  this  Day,  the  Fifth  Sunday  of  the  Fast,  it 
Was  Ordained  that  We  Celebrate  the  Memory  of 
Oi^R  Righteous  Mother,  Mary  the  Egyptian. 

Stichos 

Verily,  the  soul  did  rise  of  old  from  Mary,  and 
blood  did  flow  from  her  body.

Miriam  the  Egyptian. 
The  anniversary  of  this  pious  soul  falls  on  the  first  of 
April,  when  the  annals  of  her  life  were  compiled.  But 
remembrance  of  her  is  also  made  on  this  day,  as  the 
end  of  holy  Quadragesima  approaches,  to  arouse  the 
energy  of  the  slothful,  and  to  urge  sinners  to  repentance, 
imitating  her  example. 

Wherefore,  through  her  intercessions  with  God,  have 
mercy  upon  us  and  save  us.    Amen.

r\  CHRIST  the  Rich,  thou  hast  assumed  poverty

of  the  Rich  Man  and  Lazarus.  Let  us  contemplate  the 
end  of  both.  As  for  the  one,  let  us  run  away  from  his 
cruelty  and  hatred  of  men.  As  for  the  other,  let  us  emu-

r\  CHRIST  God,  when  thou  didst  raise  Lazarus

highest.  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord. 

Kathisma,  in  the  First  Tone 

C\  CHRIST  God,  thou  didst  have  compassion  on  the 
tears  of  Mary  and  Martha.  And,  commanding  that 
the  stone  be  rolled  away  from  the  tomb,  thou  didst  call 
the  dead  and  raise  him,  O  Life-giver,  confirming  there- 
by the  resurrection  of  the  world.  Glory,  therefore,  to  thy 
might,  O  Saviour.  Glory  to  thy  power.  Glory  to  thee,

about  erectly,  they  were  dazzled  with  wonder  and 
shouted  to  the  Rescuer,  Thee,  O  God,  with  songs  of 
praise  do  we  magnify. 

When  thou  wentest  before,  O  my  Saviour,  and  veri- 
fied thy  glorious  Resurrection,  thou  didst  deliver  Lazar- 
us from  hades,  having  been  dead  four  days.  Where- 
fore, with  songs  of  praise  do  we  magnify  thee.

C-^w  the  Einos,  the  following  eight  Idiomelons,  in  the  First  Tone. 

Q  LONG-SUFFERING  Christ,  since  thou  art  the 
Life  of  mankind  and  its  Resurrection,  thou  didst 
come  to  the  tomb  of  Lazarus,  verifying  for  us  thy  two 
Substances;  and  that  thou  didst  come  from  a  pure  Vir- 
gin, God  and  Man;  for  as  Man  thou  didst  enquire. 
Where  was  he  buried?  and  as  God,  thou  didst  raise  the 
four-day  dead  by  a  divine  gesture. 

Thou  didst  raise  from  hades  Lazarus  dead  four  days, 
O  Christ,  and  before  thine  own  Death  thou  didst  shake 
the  might  of  death.  And  through  one  friend  thou  didst 
foretell  the  delivery  of  all  mankind  from  corruption. 
Wherefore,  we  worship  thine  almighty  power,  crying. 
Blessed  art  thou,  our  Saviour;  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Verily,  Mary  and  Martha  said  to  the  Saviour,  Lord 
hadst  thou  been  here  Lazarus  would  not  have  died. 
But  Christ,  the  Resurrection  of  those  who  slumber, 
raised  him,  after  four  days,  from  the  dead.  Wherefore, 
all  ye  believers,  let  us  worship  him  that  cometh  in  glory 
to  save  our  souls. 

Wishing  to  grant  thy  Disciples  signs  of  thy  Godhead, 
O  Christ,  thou  didst  humble  thyself  before  the  crowds, 
desiring  to  hide  it.  Wherefore,  since  thou  art  God  and 
hadst  foreknowledge,  thou  didst  foretell  the  death  of 
Lazarus  to  the  Apostles.  But  when  thou  didst  come  to 
Bethany  in  the  presence  of  the  people,  thou  didst  ignore 
the  tomb  of  thy  friend,  asking,  as  a  Man,  to  know  where 


Lazarus  Saturday  727 

it  was.  But  he  whom  thou  didst  raise  after  four  days, 
declared  thy  divine  might.  Wherefore,  O  Almighty 
God,  glory  to  thee. 

Thou  didst  raise  thy  friend  after  four  days,  O  Christ, 
and  wiped  the  tears  of  Mary  and  Martha,  making  plain 
to  all  that  thou  art  he  who  fillest  all  with  thy  divine 
might,  and  with  a  will  of  divine  authority,  O  thou 
to  whom  the  cherubim  cry  ceaselessly,  Hosanna  in  the 
highest.  Blessed  art  thou  who  art  still  God  over  all. 
Glory  to  thee. 

Martha  said  to  Mary,  The  Teacher  cometh  and  he 
calleth  thee;  come.  But  she  hastened  to  where  the 
Lord  stood,  and  seeing  him,  she  fell  down  and  wor- 
shipped him,  kissing  his  pure  feet,  and  cried,  saying, 
Lord,  if  thou  hadst  been  here,  my  brother  had  not  died. 

Thou  didst  raise  Lazarus  in  Bethany  after  four  days, 
O  Lord ;  for  by  thy  mere  coming  to  the  tomb,  thy  voice 
became  life  to  the  dead.  Hades  sighed  and  fearfully 
loosed  him.  Wherefore,  great  is  the  wonder,  O  Lord 
of  great  mercy.    Glory  to  thee. 

As  thou  saidst  to  Martha,  O  Lord,  I  am  the  Resur- 
rection, thou  didst  fulfill  the  word  by  the  deed,  call- 
ing Lazarus  from  hades.  Likewise,  I  implore  thee,  O 
Lover  of  mankind,  to  raise  me,  dead  in  passion;  for 
thou  art  compassionate  and  merciful.

us,  therefore,  glorify  him;  for  he  is  greatly  to  be

VT'E  brethren:  If  we  receive  a  kingdom  which  cannot

God  acceptably  with  reverence  and  godly  fear:

but  whoremongers  and  adulterers  God  will  judge. 

Let  your  conversation  be  without  covetousness;  and 
be  content  with  such  things  as  ye  have :  for  he  hath  said, 
I  will  never  leave  thee,  nor  forsake  thee. 

So  that  we  may  boldly  say.  The  Lord  is  my  helper, 
and  I  will  not  fear  what  man  shall  do  unto  me. 

Remember  them  which  have  the  rule  over  you,  who 
have  spoken  unto  you  the  word  of  God:  whose  faith 
follow,  considering  the  end  of  their  conversation. 


Lazarus  Saturday  729 

Jesus  Christ  the  same  yesterday,  and  to-day,  and  for 
ever. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (11:1-45) 

A  T  that  time :  A  certain  man  was  sick,  named  Laza- 
^^  rus,  of  Bethany,  the  town  of  Mary  and  her  sister 
Martha. 

(It  was  that  Mary  which  anointed  the  Lord  with 
ointment,  and  wiped  his  feet  with  her  hair,  whose  broth- 
er Lazarus  was  sick.) 

Therefore  his  sisters  sent  unto  him,  saying.  Lord, 
behold,  he  whom  thou  lovest  is  sick. 

When  Jesus  heard  that,  he  said,  This  sickness  is  not 
unto  death,  but  for  the  glory  of  God,  that  the  Son  of 
God  might  be  glorified  thereby. 

Now  Jesus  loved  Martha,  and  her  sister,  and 
Lazarus. 

When  he  had  heard  therefore  that  he  was  sick,  he 
abode  two  days  still  in  the  same  place  where  he  was. 

Then  after  that  saith  he  to  his  disciples.  Let  us  go 
into  Judaea  again. 

His  disciples  say  unto  him.  Master,  the  Jews  of  late 
sought  to  stone  thee;  and  goest  thou  thither  again? 

Jesus  answered,  Are  there  not  twelve  hours  in  the 
day?  If  any  man  walk  in  the  day,  he  stumbleth  not, 
because  he  seeth  the  light  of  this  world. 

But  if  a  man  walk  in  the  night,  he  stumbleth,  because 
there  is  no  light  in  him. 

These  things  said  he:  and  after  that  he  said  unto 
them.  Our  friend  Lazarus  sleepeth ;  but  I  go,  that  I 
may  awake  him  out  of  sleep. 

Then  said  his  disciples,  Lord,  if  he  sleep,  he  shall 
do  well. 

Howbeit  Jesus  spake  of  his  death:  but  they  thought 
that  he  had  spoken  of  taking  of  rest  in  sleep. 

Then  said  Jesus  unto  them  plainly,  Lazarus  is  dead. 


730  Triodion 

And  I  am  glad  for  your  sakes  that  I  was  not  there, 
to  the  intent  ye  may  believe;  nevertheless  let  us  go 
unto  him. 

Then  said  Thomas,  which  is  called  Didymus,  unto 
his  fellow  disciples,  Let  us  also  go,  that  we  may  die  with 
him. 

Then  when  Jesus  came,  he  found  that  he  had  lain  in 
the  grave  four  days  already. 

Now  Bethany  was  nigh  unto  Jerusalem,  about  fifteen 
furlongs  off: 

And  many  of  the  Jews  came  to  Martha  and  Mary, 
to  comfort  them  concerning  their  brother. 

Then  Martha,  as  soon  as  she  heard  that  Jesus  was 
coming,  went  and  met  him:  but  Mary  sat  still  in  the 
house. 

Then  said  Martha  unto  Jesus,  Lord,  if  thou  hadst 
been  here,  my  brother  had  not  died. 

But  I  know,  that  even  now^,  whatsoever  thou  wilt  ask 
of  God,  God  will  give  it  thee. 

Jesus  saith  unto  her.  Thy  brother  shall  rise  again. 

Martha  saith  unto  him,  I  know  that  he  shall  rise 
again  in  the  resurrection  at  the  last  day. 

Jesus  said  unto  her,  I  am  the  resurrection,  and  the 
life:  he  that  believeth  in  me,  though  he  were  dead,  yet 
shall  he  live: 

And  whosoever  liveth  and  believeth  in  me  shall  never 
die.    Believest  thou  this? 

She  saith  unto  him,  Yea,  Lord :  I  believe  that  thou 
art  the  Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  which  should  come  into 
the  world. 

And  when  she  had  so  said,  she  went  her  way,  and 
called  Mary  her  sister  secretly,  saying.  The  Master  is 
come,  and  calleth  for  thee. 

As  soon  as  she  heard  that,  she  arose  quickly,  and  came 
unto  him. 

Now  Jesus  was  not  yet  come  into  the  town,  but  was 
in  that  place  where  Martha  met  him. 


Lazarus  Saturday  731 

The  Jews  then  which  were  with  her  in  the  house, 
and  comforted  her,  when  they  saw  Mary,  that  she  rose 
up  hastily  and  went  out,  followed  her,  saying.  She  goeth 
unto  the  grave  to  weep  there. 

Then  when  Mary  was  come  where  Jesus  was,  and 
saw  him,  she  fell  down  at  his  feet,  saying  unto  him, 
Lord,  if  thou  hadst  been  here,  my  brother  had  not  died. 

When  Jesus  therefore  saw  her  weeping,  and  the  Jews 
also  weeping  which  came  with  her,  he  groaned  in  the 
spirit,  and  was  troubled. 

And  said.  Where  have  ye  laid  him?  They  say  unto 
him.  Lord,  come  and  see. 

Jesus  wept. 

Then  said  the  Jews,  Behold  how  he  loved  him! 

And  some  of  them  said,  Could  not  this  man,  which 
opened  the  eyes  of  the  blind,  have  caused  that  even  this 
man  should  not  have  died? 

Jesus  therefore  again  groaning  in  himself  cometh  to 
the  grave.    It  was  a  cave,  and  a  stone  lay  upon  it. 

Jesus  said,  Take  ye  away  the  stone.  Martha,  the 
sister  of  him  that  was  dead,  saith  unto  him.  Lord,  by 
this  time  he  stinketh :  for  he  hath  been  dead  four  days. 

Jesus  saith  unto  her,  Said  I  not  unto  thee,  that,  if 
thou  wouldest  believe,  thou  shouldest  see  the  glory  of 
God? 

Then  they  took  away  the  stone  from  the  place  where 
the  dead  was  laid.  And  Jesus  lifted  up  his  eyes,  and 
said.  Father,  I  thank  thee  that  thou  hast  heard  me. 

And  I  knew  that  thou  hearest  me  always:  but  be- 
cause of  the  people  which  stand  by  I  said  it,  that  they 
may  believe  that  thou  hast  sent  me. 

And  when  he  thus  had  spoken,  he  cried  with  a  loud 
voice,  Lazarus,  come  forth. 

And  he  that  was  dead  came  forth,  bound  hand  and 
foot  with  graveclothes;  and  his  face  was  bound  about 
with  a  napkin.  Jesus  saith  unto  them.  Loose  him,  and 
let  him  go. 

Then  many  of  the  Jews  which  came  to  Mary,  and 
had  seen  the  things  which  Jesus  did,  believed  on  him.

On  this  Day,  which  is  the  Saturday  Before 
Palm  Sunday,  We  Celebrate  the  Fourth-day  Ris- 
ing FROM  THE  Dead  of  St.  Lazarus,  the  Righteous 
Friend  of  Christ. 

Stichos 

Thy  wailing  for  thy  friend,  O  Jesus,  was  the 
attribute  of  mortal  humanity  and  thy  bringing 
him  back  to  life  is  the  act  of  a  divine  and  sublime 

POWER. 

T  AZARUS  was  beloved  of  Jesus,  as  also  were  his  two 
sisters,  Martha  and  Mary,  who  were  frequent  hosts 
of  Jesus,  and  who  served  him  much  (St.  Luke  10  :38-40 
and  St.  John  12:2  and  3).  They  were  of  the  town  of 
Bethany  in  Judaea,  in  the  shadow  of  the  Mount  of 
Olives  on  the  eastern  side,  at  a  distance  of  two  Roman 
miles  from  Jerusalem.  A  few  days  before  the  Passion 
of  salvation,  Lazarus  took  sick.  And  while  Jesus  was 
still  in  Galilee,  Lazarus'  sister  told  Jesus  of  his  sickness. 
Jesus  remained  purposely  in  Galilee  two  days  until 
Lazarus  died.  Then  he  said  to  his  Disciples,  Let  us 
go  to  Judaea,  that  I  may  awaken  our  beloved  Lazarus 
who  has  fallen  asleep,  meaning  thereby  the  deep  sleep 
of  death.  And  when  he  reached  Bethany,  four  days  after 
the  burial  of  Lazarus,  he  comforted  his  sister,  and  hav- 
ing groaned  in  spirit  at  the  death  of  his  beloved  friend, 
he  asked  where  they  had  put  him.  He  wept,  and,  hav- 
ing come  to  the  tomb,  he  commanded  that  the  stone  be 
removed.    Then  he  lifted  up  his  eyes  and  thanked  God 


Palm  Sunday  733 

the  Father,  and  cried  with  a  loud  voice,  Lazarus,  come 
forth.  And  the  dead  came  out  wrapped  in  grave- 
clothes.  And  Jesus  said  to  those  standing  by,  Loose  him 
and  let  him  go  ( St.  John  11).  In  remembrance,  there- 
fore, of  this  supernatural  miracle,  we  celebrate  this  day. 

It  is  related  in  ancient  accounts  that  Lazarus  was 
thirty  years  old  when  Jesus  raised  him,  and  that  he 
lived  thereafter  thirty  years  longer,  and  died  in  Cyprus 
in  the  year  63  of  Christ.  It  is  also  said  that  near  the 
city  of  Citium  lies  a  tomb  on  which  there  is  the  follow- 
ing legend,  Lazarus  of  four  days,  beloved  of  Christ. 
In  890,  Leo  the  Wise  removed  his  bones  to  Constanti- 
nople. Doubtless  it  was  then  that  the  duets  chanted  at 
Vespers  of  his  festival  were  composed.  They  begin, 
If  thou  wishest,  O  Lord,  to  see  the  tomb  of  Lazarus,  etc. 

Wherefore,  through  the  intercessions  of  thy  friend,  O 
Christ  God,  have  mercy  upon  us.    Arnen.

to  Bethany  on  a  dumb  ass.  Wherefore,  the  Hebrew 
lads  praised  him,  carrying  in  their  hands  branches,  and 
crying,  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh,  King  of  Israel. 

Let  us  also,  the  new  Israel,  come  together  today,  the 
Church  of  the  Gentiles,  to  shout  with  the  Prophet 
Zachariah,  Rejoice  greatly,  O  daughter  of  Zion;  shout, 
O  daughter  of  Jerusalem ;  behold  thy  King  cometh  unto 
thee:  he  is  meek  and  having  salvation,  and  riding  upon 
an  ass,  and  upon  a  colt  the  foal  of  an  ass.  Wherefore, 
like  babes,  feast  thou,  carrying  branches  in  thy  hands, 
and  praise  him,  singing,  Hosanna  in  the  highest.  Blessed 
is  he  that  cometh,  King  of  Israel. 

O  good  Christ,  when  thou  didst  foreshadow  for  us 
thine  exalted  Resurrection,  thou  didst  raise  from  the 
tomb  by  thine  own  command  thy  breathless  friend  Laza- 
rus, who  had  been  dead  for  four  days,  and  had  become 
decomposed.  Thou  didst  mount  symbolically  upon  an 
ass,  as  one  borne  upon  a  chariot,  thus  indicating  the 
Gentiles.  Wherefore,  beloved  Israel  did  ofifer  thee 
praise  from  the  mouths  of  innocent  babes  and  sucklings, 
having  beheld  thee,  O  Saviour,  entering  into  the  holy 
city  six  days  before  the  Passover. 

Before  the  six  days  of  the  Passover,  Jesus  came  to 
Bethany,  and  his  Disciples  came  to  him  and  said,  O 
Lord,  where  wouldest  thou  that  we  prepare  for  thee  to 
eat  the  Passover?  And  he  sent  them,  saying.  Go  to  the 
town  that  lieth  before  you,  and  ye  shall  find  a  man  car- 
rying a  jar  of  water.  Follow  him,  and  say  to  the  Lord 
of  the  house.  The  Master  saith,  I  shall  eat  the  Passover 
with  my  Disciples.

JACOB  called  unto  his  sons,  and  said:  Gather  your- 
selves together,  that  I  may  tell  you  that  which  shall 
befall  you  in  the  last  days. 


Palm  Sunday  735 

Gather  yourselves  together,  and  hear,  ye  sons  of 
Jacob;  and  hearken  unto  Israel  your  father. 

Judah,  thou  art  he  whom  thy  brethren  shall  praise: 
thy  hand  shall  be  in  the  neck  of  thine  enemies;  thy 
father's  children  shall  bow  down  before  thee. 

Judah  is  a  lion's  whelp:  from  the  prey,  my  son,  thou 
art  gone  up:  he  stooped  down,  he  couched  as  a  lion, 
and  as  an  old  lion;  who  shall  rouse  him  up? 

The  sceptre  shall  not  depart  from  Judah,  nor  a  law- 
giver from  between  his  feet,  until  Shiloh  come;  and 
unto  him  shall  the  gathering  of  the  people  be. 

Binding  his  foal  unto  the  vine,  and  his  ass's  colt  unto 
the  choice  vine;  he  washed  his  garments  in  wine,  and 
his  clothes  in  the  blood  of  grapes: 

His  eyes  shall  be  red  with  wine,  and  his  teeth  white

Second  Reading :  from  the  Prophecy  of  Xephaniah

^  of  Zion;  shout,  O  Israel;  be  glad  and  rejoice  with 
all  the  heart,  O  daughter  of  Jerusalem. 

The  Lord  hath  taken  away  thy  judgments,  he  hath 
cast  out  thine  enemy:  the  King  of  Israel,  even  the  Lord, 
is  in  the  midst  of  thee :  thou  shalt  not  see  evil  any  more. 

In  that  day  it  shall  be  said  to  Jerusalem,  Fear  thou 
not:  and  to  Zion,  Let  not  thine  hands  be  slack. 

The  Lord  thy  God  in  the  midst  of  thee  is  mighty;  he 
will  save,  he  will  rejoice  over  thee  with  joy;  he  will  rest 
in  his  love,  he  will  joy  over  thee  with  singing. 

I  will  gather  them  that  are  sorrowful  for  the  solemn 
assembly,  who  are  of  thee,  to  whom  the  reproach  of  it 
was  a  burden. 

Behold,  at  that  time  I  will  undo  all  that  afflict  thee: 
and  I  will  save  her  that  halteth,  and  gather  her  that 
was  driven  out;  and  I  will  get  them  praise  and  fame  in 
every  land.

the  Prophet  (9:945) 

nPHESE  sayings  the  Lord  doth  say:  Rejoice  greatly, 
O  daughter  of  Zion;  shout,  O  daughter  of  Jerusa- 
lem :  behold,  thy  King  cometh  unto  thee :  he  is  just,  and 
having  salvation;  lowly,  and  riding  upon  an  ass  and 
upon  a  colt  the  foal  of  an  ass. 

And  I  will  cut  ofif  the  chariot  from  Ephraim,  and  the 
horse  from  Jerusalem,  and  the  battle  bow  shall  be  cut 
off:  and  he  shall  speak  peace  unto  the  heathen:  and  his 
dominion  shall  be  from  sea  even  to  sea,  and  from  the 
river  even  to  the  ends  of  the  earth. 

As  for  thee  also,  by  the  blood  of  thy  covenant  I  have 
sent  forth  thy  prisoners  out  of  the  pit  wherein  is  no 
water. 

Turn  you  to  the  stronghold,  ye  prisoners  of  hope: 
even  to-day  do  I  declare  that  I  will  render  double  unto 
thee; 

When  I  have  bent  Judah  for  me,  filled  the  bow  with 
Ephraim,  and  raised  up  thy  sons,  O  Zion  against  thy 
sons,  O  Greece,  and  made  thee  as  the  sword  of  a  mighty 
man. 

And  the  Lord  shall  be  seen  over  them,  and  his  arrow 
shall  go  forth  as  the  lightning:  and  the  Lord  God  shall 
blow  the  trumpet,  and  shall  go  with  whirlwinds  of  the 
south. 

The  Lord  of  hosts  shall  defend  them. 

^And  in  the  Litiya,  Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Third  Tone. 

CIX  days  before  the  Passover,  Jesus  came  to  Bethany 
to  call  Lazarus,  who  had  been  dead  for  four  days, 
and  to  preach  beforehand  of  the  Resurrection.  And  the 
two  women,  Mary  and  Martha,  the  sisters  of  Lazarus, 
met  him  crying.  Lord,  if  thou  hadst  been  here  our 
brother  had  not  died.  Then  he  said  unto  them.  Have  I 
not  told  you  that  whosoever  believeth  in  me,  though  he

die  he  shall  live  again?  Show  me  where  ye  have  laid 
him.  And  the  All-creator  cried  out  to  him,  Lazarus, 
come  forth.

T)  EJOICE  and  be  happy,  O  city  of  Zion.  Be  joyful 
^^^  and  glad,  O  Church  of  God;  for  behold,  thy  King 
is  come  sitting  upon  a  colt  and  praised  by  youth.  Ho- 
sanna  in  the  highest.  Blessed  art  thou  who  art  possessed 
of  bountiful  mercies:  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Stichos:  Out  of  the  mouths  of  infants  and  of  suck- 
lings thou  hast  perfected  praise. 

Today  hath  the  Saviour  come  to  Jerusalem  to  fulfill 
the  Scriptures;  and  all  did  take  in  their  hands  branches 
of  palm  trees.  And  they  spread  their  clothes  for  him, 
knowing  that  it  was  he,  our  Lord,  to  whom  the  cheru- 
bim unceasingly  call  out,  Hosanna  in  the  highest. 
Blessed  art  thou  who  art  possessed  of  bountiful  mercies; 
have  mercy  upon  us. 

Stichos:  O  Lord,  our  Lord,  how  admirable  is  thy 
Name  in  all  the  earth! 

O  thou  who  ridest  upon  the  cherubim,  and  who  art 
praised  by  the  seraphim,  thou  didst  ride  upon  a  colt, 
O  holy,  Davidic  One.  And  the  youths  were  praising 
thee  as  befitteth  God.  And  the  Jews  did  blaspheme 
against  thee  wickedly.  Thy  sitting  on  an  ass  fore- 
shadowed the  transformation  of  the  bolting  of  the  Gen- 
tiles from  infidelity  to  faith.  Glory  to  thee  O  Christ, 
who  alone  art  merciful  and  the  Lover  of  mankind.

thou  didst  consent  to  rescue  Adam  from  the  first  curse, 
and  didst  prepare  all  things  for  the  best,  O  thou  Word, 
Lover  of  mankind,  glory  to  thee. 

O  Lord,  thou  didst  raise  Lazarus  from  the  tomb  after 
four  days,  and  thou  didst  teach  all  to  shout  to  thee  with 
palm  leaves  and  branches.  Blessed  art  thou  that  comest. 

O  Christ  Saviour,  thou  didst  shed  tears  in  secret  over 
thy  friend  Lazarus  lying  dead.  Thou  didst  raise  him 
from  the  dead,  thereby  declaring  thy  pity  in  love  to 
mankind.  And  when  the  multitude  of  little  children 
knew  of  thy  presence  they  went  out  today  carrying  in

The  Matin  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew 
(21:1-11;  15-17) 

A  T  that  time :  When  Jesus  drew  nigh  unto  Jerusalem, 
^  ^  and  was  come  to  Bethphage,  unto  the  Mount  of 
Olives,  then  sent  Jesus  two  disciples, 


Palm  Sunday  739 

Saying  unto  them,  Go  into  the  village  over  against 
you,  and  straightway  ye  shall  find  an  ass  tied,  and  a  colt 
with  her:  loose  them,  and  bring  them  unto  me. 

And  if  any  man  say  aught  unto  you,  ye  shall  say,  The 
Lord  hath  need  of  them;  and  straightway  he  will  send 
them. 

All  this  was  done,  that  it  might  be  fulfilled  which 
was  spoken  by  the  prophet,  saying. 

Tell  ye  the  daughter  of  Sion,  Behold,  thy  King  com- 
eth  unto  thee,  meek,  and  sitting  upon  an  ass,  and  a  colt 
the  foal  of  an  ass. 

And  the  disciples  went,  and  did  as  Jesus  commanded 
them, 

And  brought  the  ass,  and  the  colt,  and  put  on  them 
their  clothes,  and  they  set  him  thereon. 

And  a  very  great  multitude  spread  their  garments  in 
the  way;  others  cut  down  branches  from  the  trees,  and 
strewed  them  in  the  way. 

And  the  multitudes  that  went  before,  and  that  fol- 
lowed, cried,  saying,  Hosanna  to  the  Son  of  David : 
Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  name  of  the  Lord;  Ho- 
sanna in  the  highest. 

And  when  he  was  come  into  Jerusalem,  all  the  city 
was  moved,  saying,  Who  is  this? 

And  the  people  said.  This  is  Jesus  the  prophet  of 
Nazareth  of  Galilee. 

And  when  the  chief  priests  and  scribes  saw  the  won- 
derful things  that  he  did,  and  the  children  crying  in 
the  temple,  and  saying  Hosanna  to  the  son  of  David; 
they  were  sore  displeased. 

And  he  said  unto  him,  Hearest  thou  what  these  say? 
And  Jesus  saith  unto  them.  Yea:  have  ye  never  read, 
Out  of  the  mouth  of  babes  and  sucklings  thou  hast  per- 
fected praise? 

And  he  left  them,  and  went  out  of  the  city  into  Beth- 
any; and  he  lodged  there.

1.  Verily,  the  springs  of  the  deep  appeared  dry,  and 
the  foundations  of  the  tumultuous  sea  were  uncovered; 
for  thou  didst  rebuke  the  tempest  with  a  sign,  and  thou 
didst  save  thy  chosen  people  singing  to  thee,  O  Lord,  a 
triumphant  song. 

3.  Verily,  at  thy  command  the  children  of  Israel 
drank  from  a  hard,  cloven  rock.  As  for  the  rock,  it  is 
thou,  O  Christ,  the  Life  by  which  the  Church  gaineth 
strength,  crying,  Hosanna,  blessed  art  thou  that  comest. 

4.  Verily,  Christ  our  Lord  clearly  cometh  and  de- 
layeth  not;  from  a  thick  and  shadowy  mountain,  from 
a  Virgin  who  giveth  birth  without  knowing  man,  as 
was  told  by  the  Prophet  of  old.  Wherefore,  we  all 
shout  together.  Glory  be  to  thy  power,  O  Lord. 

5.  O  thou  bringer  of  good  tidings  to  Zion,  ascend  the 
mountain;  and  O  thou  watchman  of  Jerusalem,  raise 
thy  voice  with  strength.  Glorious  things  have  been 
spoken  of  thee,  O  city  of  God.  Peace  to  Israel,  and 
salvation  to  the  Gentiles. 

6.  Verily,  the  souls  of  the  righteous  have  shouted 
with  joy,  saying.  Now  a  new  covenant  hath  been  given 
the  world,  let  the  people  be  renewed  with  the  drops  of 
divine  blood. 

7.  O  thou  who  didst  preserve  the  Abrahamite  youths 
safe  from  fire,  and  didst  kill  the  Chaldeans  who  preyed 
unjustly  upon  the  innocent,  O  most  praised  Lord, 
blessed  art  thou,  God  of  our  fathers. 

8.  Rejoice,  O  Jerusalem,  and  feast  O  lovers  of  Zion; 
for  the  Lord  of  power,  who  ruleth  for  ever,  hath  come.

brate the  Feast,  and  let  us  rejoice  and  magnify  Christ; 
and  with  palms  and  branches  let  us  raise  our  voices 
unto  him  with  praise,  saying,  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh 
in  the  Name  of  the  Lord  our  Saviour. 

Why  did  ye  tremble,  O  ye  Gentiles?  And  ye  priests 
and  scribes,  why  did  ye  rant  in  falsehood,  saying.  Who 
is  this  to  whom  the  youths  with  palms  and  branches 
shout.  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord  our  Saviour? 

He  is  the  God  whom  no  one  may  equal.  He  hath 
devised  every  just  way,  and  hath  bestowd  it  on  beloved 
Israel,  after  he  appeared,  and  walked  with  the  people. 
Blessed,  therefore,  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord  our  Saviour. 

O  rebellious  ones!  Why  have  ye  placed  stumbling- 
blocks  in  our  ways?  Your  feet  are  fast  to  shed  the 
blood  of  the  Master,  but  he  shall  rise  to  save  those  who 
cry  unto  him,  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  Name  of 
the  Lord  our  Saviour.

thou  who  hast  come  and  wilt  yet  come,  in  the  Name  of 
the  Lord. 

O  Lord,  when  thou  wast  about  to  enter  the  Holy 
City,  the  Gentiles  did  carry  tree  branches,  praising  thee, 
O  Lord  of  all;  for  in  seeing  thee  mounted  on  the  colt

they  saw  thee  as  sitting  on  the  cherubim,  and  therefore 
shouted  thus,  Hosanna  in  the  highest  blessed  art  thou 
who  comest,  and  wilt  yet  come,  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord. 

Go  ye  out,  O  people!  Go  ye  out,  O  Gentiles,  and  see 
today  the  King  of  heaven  sitting  on  a  humble  ass  as  on 
a  sublime  throne,  coming  to  Jerusalem.  And  ye  cor- 
rupt and  unbelieving  generation  of  Jews,  come  ye  out 
and  see  him  whom  Isaiah  saw  coming  in  the  body  for 
our  sakes.  How  he  would  take  unto  himself  the  new 
Zion  as  a  pure  bride,  and  cast  out  the  confounded  coun- 
cil. And  the  young,  innocent,  and  unpolluted,  have 
come  out  together,  praising  as  it  were  an  incorrupt  and 
immaculate  marriage.  With  them  let  us  cry  out  with 
the  praise  of  angels,  Hosanna  in  the  highest  to  whom 
belongeth  the  Great  Mercy. 

O  Christ  God,  when  before  thy  voluntary  sufferings 
thou  didst  explain  to  all  the  confirmation  of  universal 
resurrection;  thou  didst  raise  Lazarus  in  Bethany  by 
thine  exalted  might,  after  he  had  been  dead  for  four 
days.  And  to  the  blind  thou  didst  give  sight;  for  thou 
art  the  Giver  of  light,  O  Saviour.  Thou  didst  also 
enter  the  city  with  thy  Disciples,  sitting  on  an  ass,  ful- 
filling the  preaching  of  the  Prophets,  as  though  riding 
upon  the  cherubim,  and  the  Hebrew  youths  received 
thee  with  palms  and  branches.  Wherefore,  we  also 
carry  olive  branches  and  palms,  crying  out  to  thee  in 
gratitude,  Hosanna  in  the  highest,  blessed  is  he  that 
cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord.

whatsoever  modest,  whatsoever  just,  whatsoever  holy, 
whatsoever  lovely,  whatsoever  of  good  fame,  if  there 
be  any  virtue,  if  any  praise  of  discipline,  think  on  these 
things. 

The  things  which  you  have  both  learned,  and  re- 
ceived, and  heard,  and  seen  in  me,  these  do  ye,  and  the 
God  of  peace  shall  be  with  you. 


744  Triodion 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (12:1-18) 

JESUS,  six  days  before  the  pasch,  came  to  Bethania, 
where  Lazarus  had  been  dead,  whom  Jesus  raised 
to  life. 

And  they  made  him  a  supper  there:  and  Martha 
served :  but  Lazarus  was  one  of  them  that  were  at  table 
with  him. 

Mary  therefore  took  a  pound  of  ointment  of  right 
spikenard,  of  great  price,  and  anointed  the  feet  of  Jesus, 
and  wiped  his  feet  with  her  hair;  and  the  house  was 
filled  with  the  odour  of  the  ointment. 

Then  one  of  his  disciples,  Judas  Iscariot,  he  that  was 
about  to  betray  him,  said : 

Why  was  not  this  ointment  sold  for  three  hundred 
pence,  and  given  to  the  poor? 

Now  he  said  this,  not  because  he  cared  for  the  poor; 
but  because  he  was  a  thief,  and  having  the  purse,  car- 
ried the  things  that  were  put  therein. 

Jesus  therefore  said  :  Let  her  alone,  that  she  may  keep 
it  against  the  day  of  my  burial. 

For  the  poor  you  have  always  with  you;  but  me  you 
have  not  always. 

A  great  multitude  therefore  of  the  Jews  knew  that 
he  was  there;  and  they  came,  not  for  Jesus'  sake  only, 
but  that  they  might  see  Lazarus,  whom  he  had  raised 
from  the  dead. 

But  the  chief  priests  thought  to  kill  Lazarus  also: 

Because  many  of  the  Jews,  by  reason  of  him,  went 
away,  and  believed  in  Jesus. 

And  on  the  next  day,  a  great  multitude  that  was  come 
to  the  festival  day,  when  they  had  heard  that  Jesus  was 
coming  to  Jerusalem, 

Took  branches  of  palm  trees,  and  went  forth  to  meet 
him,  and  cried:  Hosanna,  blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in 
the  name  of  the  Lord,  the  king  of  Israel. 

And  Jesus  found  a  young  ass,  and  sat  upon  it,  as  it 
is  written: 

Fear  not,  daughter  of  Sion:  behold,  thy  king  cometh, 
sitting  on  an  ass's  colt. 


Palm  Sunday  745 

These  things  his  disciples  did  not  know  at  the  first; 
but  when  Jesus  was  glorified,  then  they  remembered 
that  these  things  were  written  of  him,  and  that  they  had 
done  these  things  to  him. 

The  multitude  therefore  gave  testimony,  which  was 
with  him,  when  he  called  Lazarus  out  of  the  grave,  and 
raised  him  from  the  dead. 

For  which  reason  also  the  people  came  to  meet  him, 
because  they  heard  that  he  had  done  this  miracle.

On  this  Day,  Which  is  Palm  Sunday,  We  Cele- 
brate THE  Glorious  and  Brilliant  Feast  of  the 

ExNTRANCE   OF   OUR   LORD   JESUS    CHRIST   INTO   JERU- 
SALEM. 

Stichos 

He  sitteth  on  an  ass,  who  did  stretch  out  the 
earth's  pole  by  his  divine  word,  seeking  to  deliver 
mankind  from  bestiality. 

JESUS  came  to  Bethany  on  a  Sunday  falling  on  the 
eighteenth  of  March,  before  the  Mosaic  Passover  of 
six  days.  On  the  following  day  he  sent  two  of  his  Dis- 
ciples, who  brought  him  an  ass  on  which  he  sat  to  enter 
the  city.  And  when  the  great  multitude  heard  that 
Jesus  was  coming  to  Jerusalem,  they  immediately  took 
palm  branches  in  their  hands  and  went  out  to  meet  him. 
Some  even  spread  their  clothes  in  the  road  which  he  was 
about  to  traverse,  and  some  cut  down  branches  from 
the  trees  and  strewed  the  road  therewith.  And  those 
who  went  before  him,  and  those  who  followed,  even  the 
children,  were  all  crying,  Hosanna,  blessed  is  he  that 
cometh  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  King  of  Israel!  (St. 
John  12:13).  Therefore,  we  celebrate  on  this  festal  and 
brilliant  day  the  entrance  of  our  Lord  into  Jerusalem. 


746  Triodion 

The  branches  of  palm  trees  were  a  symbol  of  Christ^s 
victory  over  Satan  and  death.  And  the  meaning  of 
Hosanna  is,  We  pray  thee  save,  or,  Therefore,  save. 
And  the  ass's  colt,  which  was  still  an  untamed  animal, 
and  impure  according  to  the  law,  and  Christ's  sitting 
thereon,  symbolize  the  former  savagry  and  impurity 
of  the  Gentiles,  and  their  subsequent  taming  and  obedi- 
ence to  the  holy  law  of  the  Gospel. 

Wherefore,  through  thine  indescribable  mercy,  O 
Christ,  grant  us  to  overcome  our  beastly  passions,  and

{twelve  times);  O  come,  let  us  worship,  etc.  {threee  times);  and 
the  following  two  Psalms,  with  little  intonation,  during  which  the 
Priest  burneth  incense. 

Psalm  19 

1\/TAY  the  Lord,  hear  thee  in  the  day  of  tribulation: 

^   may  the  name  of  the  God  of  Jacob  protect  thee. 

May  he  send  thee  help  from  the  sanctuary:  and  de- 
fend thee  out  of  Sion. 

May  he  be  mindful  of  all  thy  sacrifices:  and  may 
thy  whole  burnt  offering  be  made  fat. 

May  he  give  thee  according  to  thy  own  heart;  and 
confirm  all  thy  counsels. 

We  will  rejoice  in  thy  salvation;  and  in  the  name  of 
our  God  we  shall  be  exalted. 

The  Lord  fulfill  all  thy  petitions :  now  have  I  known 
that  the  Lord  hath  saved  his  anointed. 

He  will  hear  him  from  his  holy  heaven :  the  salvation 
of  his  right  hand  is  in  powers. 

Some  trust  in  chariots,  and  some  in  horses:  but  we 
will  call  upon  the  name  of  the  Lord  our  God. 

They  are  bound,  and  have  fallen,  but  we  are  risen, 
and  are  set  upright. 

O  Lord,  save  the  king :  and  hear  us  in  the  day  that  we 
shall  call  upon  thee. 

Psalm  20 

TN  thy  strength,  O  Lord,  the  king  shall  joy;  and  in 

thy  salvation  he  shall  rejoice  exceedingly. 

Thou  hast  given  him  his  heart's  desire:  and  hast  not 
withholden  from  him  the  will  of  his  lips. 

For  thou  hast  prevented  him  with  blessings  of  sweet- 
ness: thou  hast  set  on  his  head  a  crown  of  precious 
stones. 

He  asked  life  of  thee :  and  thou  hast  given  him  length 
of  days  for  ever  and  ever. 

His  glory  is  great  in  thy  salvation:  glory  and  great 
beauty  shalt  thou  lay  upon  him. 


Palm  Sunday  Evening  749 

For  thou  shalt  give  him  to  be  a  blessing  for  ever  and 
ever:  thou  shalt  make  him  joyful  in  gladness  with  thy 
countenance. 

For  the  king  hopeth  in  the  Lord:  and  through  the 
mercy  of  the  most  High  he  shall  not  be  moved. 

Let  thy  hand  be  found  by  all  thy  enemies:  let  thy 
right  hand  find  out  all  them  that  hate  thee. 

Thou  shalt  make  them  as  an  oven  of  fire,  in  the  time 
of  thy  anger:  the  Lord  shall  trouble  them  in  his  wrath, 
and  fire  shall  devour  them. 

Their  fruit  shalt  thou  destroy  from  the  earth:  and 
their  seed  from  among  the  children  of  men. 

For  they  have  intended  evils  against  thee:  they  have 
devised  counsels  which  they  have  not  been  able  to  estab- 
lish. 

For  thou  shalt  make  them  turn  their  back :  in  thy  rem- 
nants thou  shalt  prepare  their  face. 

Be  thou  exalted,  O  Lord,  in  thy  own  strength  :  we  will 
sing  and  praise  thy  power. 

CAnd  after  the  six  Matin  Psalms  (pp.  26-32),  sing  slowly  and 
with  intonation,  Allelulia  (four  tiines) ,  in  the  Eighth  Tone.  Then 
sing  slowly  twice,  and  once  briefly,  the  following  Troparion. 

BEHOLD,  the  Bridegroom  cometh  at  midnight,  and 
blessed  is  the  servant  whom  he  shall  find  awake. 
But  he  whom  he  shall  find  neglectful,  is  verily  un- 
worthy. Behold,  therefore,  my  soul,  beware,  lest  thou 
fallest  into  deep  slumber,  and  the  door  of  the  kingdom 
be  closed  against  thee,  and  thou  be  delivered  to  death. 
But  be  thou  wakeful,  crying.  Holy!  Holy!  Holy!  art 
thou,  O  God.  Through  the  intercessions  of  the  incor- 
porals,  have  mercy  upon  us.

750  Passion  Week 

A/^ERILY,  on  this  present  day  shall  be  revealed  to  the 
world  the  solemn  Passion  as  a  saving  light;  for 
Christ  of  his  own  goodness  shall  come  to  suffer.  And 
he  who  holdeth  all  in  the  hollow  of  his  hand  consenteth 
to  be  suspended  on  a  Tree  to  save  man. 

O  thou  unseen  Judge,  how  wast  thou  seen  in  the  flesh, 
and  how  camest  thou  to  be  killed  in  the  body  by  trans- 
gressors of  the  law,  judging  our  case  by  thy  Passion? 
Wherefore,  we  address  to  thee  praise  and  magnifica- 
tion, O  Word,  and  in  unison  we  offer  glory  to  thy  power. 

^And  the  following,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

T/'ERILY,  this  present  day  ushereth  in  with  splendour 
the  Passion  of  the  Lord.  Come,  therefore,  O  feast 
lovers,  let  us  welcome  it  with  songs;  for  the  Creator 
Cometh  to  accept  crucifixion,  examination,  lashes,  and 
to  be  condemned  by  Pilate,  smitten  on  his  face  by  a 
servant,  and  to  bear  all  things  to  save  man.  Wherefore, 
we  cry  unto  him;  O  Christ  God,  Lover  of  mankind, 
grant  forgiveness  of  sins  to  them  who  in  faith  worship 
thy  pure  Passion.     {Repeat.) 

^And  immediately  the  Priest  shall  say,  And  that  we  may  be  worthy, 
etc. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (21:18-43) 

AT  that  time:  As  the  Lord  returns  to  the  city,  he 
hungered. 

And  seeing  a  fig  tree  by  the  way' side,  he  came  to  it, 
and  found  nothing  thereon,  but  leaves  only;  and  he  saith 
unto  it.  Let  there  be  no  fruit  from  thee  henceforward 
for  ever.    And  immediately  the  fig  tree  withered  away. 

And  when  the  disciples  saw  it,  they  marvelled,  saying, 
How  did  the  fig  tree  immediately  wither  away? 

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  them.  Verily  I  say 
unto  you,  If  ye  have  faith,  and  doubt  not,  ye  shall  not 
only  do  what  is  done  to  the  fig  tree,  but  even  if  ye  shall 
say  unto  this  mountain.  Be  thou  taken  up  and  cast  into 
the  sea,  it  shall  be  done. 


Palm  Sunday  Evening  751 

And  all  things,  whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  in  prayer, 
believing,  ye  shall  receive. 

And  when  he  was  come  to  the  temple,  the  chief  priests 
and  the  elders  of  the  people  come  unto  him  as  he  was 
teaching,  and  said ;  By  what  authority  doest  thou  these 
things?  And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  them,  I  also 
will  ask  you  one  question,  which  if  ye  tell  me,  I  like- 
wise will  tell  you  by  what  authority  I  do  these  things. 

The  baptism  of  John,  whence  was  it?  from  heaven  or 
from  men?  And  they  reasoned  with  themselves,  saying. 
If  we  shall  say.  From  heaven,  he  will  say  unto  us.  Why 
then  did  ye  not  believe  him? 

But  if  we  will  say,  From  men :  we  fear  the  multitude ; 
for  all  hold  John  as  a  prophet. 

And  they  answered  Jesus,  and  said;  We  know  not. 
He  also  said  unto  them;  Neither  tell  I  you  by  what 
authority  I  do  these  things. 

But  what  think  ye?  A  man  had  two  sons :  and  he  came 
to  the  first,  and  said.  Son,  go  work  today  in  the  vineyard. 

And  he  answered  and  said,  I  will  not:  but  afterward 
he  repented  himself,  and  went. 

And  he  came  to  the  second,  and  said  likewise.  And 
he  answered  and  said,  I  go,  sir:  and  went  not. 

Which  of  the  two  did  the  will  of  his  father?  They  say, 
The  first.  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Verily  I  say  unto  you, 
that  the  publicans  and  the  harlots  go  into  the  kingdom 
of  God  before  you. 

For  John  came  unto  you  in  the  way  of  righteousness, 
and  ye  believed  him  not:  but  the  publicans  and  harlots 
believed  him:  and  ye,  when  ye  saw  it,  did  not  even  re- 
pent yourselves  afterward,  that  ye  might  believe  him. 

Hear  another  parable:  There  was  a  man  that  was  an 
householder,  who  planted  a  vineyard,  and  set  a  hedge 
about  it,  and  digged  a  winepress  in  it,  and  built  a  tower, 
and  let  it  out  to  husbandmen  and  went  into  another 
country. 

And  when  the  season  of  the  fruits  drew  near,  he  sent 
his  servants  to  the  husbandmen,  to  receive  his  fruits. 


752  Passion  Week 

And  the  husbandmen  took  his  servants,  and  beat  one, 
and  killed  another,  and  stoned  another. 

Again,  he  sent  other  servants  more  than  the  first  and 
they  did  unto  them  in  like  manner. 

But  afterward  he  sent  unto  them  his  son,  saying,  They 
will  reverence  my  son. 

But  the  husbandmen,  when  they  saw  the  son,  said 
among  themselves.  This  is  the  heir;  come,  let  us  kill 
him,  and  take  his  inheritance. 

And  they  took  him  and  cast  him  forth  out  of  the  vine- 
yard, and  killed  him. 

When  therefore  the  lord  of  the  vineyard  shall  come, 
what  will  he  do  unto  those  husbandmen? 

They  say  unto  him;  He  will  miserably  destroy  those 
miserable  men,  and  will  let  out  the  vineyard  unto  other 
husbandmen,  who  shall  render  him  the  fruits  in  their 
seasons. 

Jesus  saith  unto  them;  Did  ye  never  read  in  the  scrip- 
ures. 

The  stone  which  the  builders  rejected. 

The  same  was  made  the  head  of  the  corner; 

This  was  from  the  Lord. 

And  it  is  marvellous  in  our  eyes. 

Therefore  say  I  unto  you,  the  kingdom  of  God  shall 
be  taken  from  you,  and  given  to  a  nation  bringing  forth 
the  fruits  thereof. 

^Then  Psalm  50  {p.  82);  the  Little  Synapte;  and  the  following 
Canon,  the  Hermos  being  sung  after  the  Ode  as  a  Katabasia. 

First  Ode,,  in  the  Second  Tone — Hermos 

T  ET  us  praise  the  Lord  by  whose  divine  command 
^-^  the  tumultuous,  uncharted  sea  was  dried  up,  and 
who  led  the  children  of  Israel  through  it;  for  in  glory 
he  hath  been  glorified. 

Verily,  the  ineffable  condescension  of  the  Word  of 
God,  even  Christ,  who  is  himself  God  and  Man,  was 
not  accounted  robbery,  he  being  God  and  taking  the

likeness  of  a  servant,  as  he  revealed  to  his  Disciples;  for 
in  ^lory  he  hath  been  glorified. 

Yea,  I  the  Creator,  rich  in  Godhead,  came  myself  to 
serve  poor  Adam,  whose  likeness  I  took  w^illingly,  and 
to  give  myself  as  a  Redemption  for  him,  w^ho  am  with- 
out suffering  as  to  my  Godhead. 

^Then    the    Little    Synapte;    and    the    following    Kontakion,     in 
the  Eighth  Tone. 

JACOB  wailed  the  loss  of  Joseph  while  that  brave 
youth  was  sitting  in  a  chariot  like  an  honoured 
king;  for  at  that  time,  not  having  enslaved  himself  to 
the  pleasures  of  Egypt,  he  was  glorified  instead  by  God, 
who  looketh  into  the  hearts  of  men,  and  who  granteth 
them  incorruptible  crowns. 

Oikos:  Let  us  add  wailing  to  wailing,  shedding  tears, 
and  mourning  with  Jacob  for  chaste  Joseph  of  perpet- 
ual memory,  who  was  enslaved  in  the  flesh.  But  his  soul 
he  preserved  free,  and  he  was  lord  over  all  Egypt;  for 
God  granteth  his  servants  incorruptible  crowns. 


Synaxarion 

Great  Holy  Monday 

C\^  this  day  begins  the  anniversary  of  the  holy  Pas- 
^^^  sion  of  the  Saviour,  he  of  whom  Joseph  of  exceed- 
ing beauty  is  taken  as  the  earliest  symbol;  for  this  Jo- 
seph was  the  eleventh  of  the  sons  of  Jacob,  and  because 
his  father  loved  him  exceedingly,  his  brothers  envied 
him  and  threw  him  into  a  pit.  Then  they  took  him  out 
and  sold  him  to  strangers,  who  sold  him  in  Egypt.  He 
was  slandered  for  his  chastity,  and  was  thrown  into  pris- 
on. But  finally  he  was  taken  out  of  prison,  and  he  at- 
tained a  high  rank,  and  received  honours  worthy  of 
kings,  becoming  governor  of  the  whole  of  Egypt,  whose 
people  he  supported.  Thus  he  symbolized  in  himself 
the  Passion  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  his  consequent 
great  glory  (Gen.  40:41), 


754  Passion  Week 

To  the  remembrance  of  Joseph  is  added  the  story  of 
the  fig  tree  which  the  Lord  cursed  on  this  day  (corres- 
ponding at  that  time  to  the  nineteenth  of  the  month  of 
March)  because  of  its  barrenness,  so  that  it  dried  up. 
The  fig  tree  was  a  symbol  of  the  Council  of  the  Jews 
which  did  not  show  the  necessary  fruits  of  virtue  and 
righteousness,  so  that  Christ  stripped  it  of  every  spirit- 
ual grace  (St.  Mt.  21:18-20). 

Wherefore,  by  the  intercessions  of  all-comely  Joseph, 
O  Christ,  have  mercy  upon  us. 

Eighth  Ode — Hermos 

T/ERILY,  the  fire  fed  with  measureless  matter,  fled 
trembling  from  the  agreement  of  the  pure  youths 
and  from  their  bodies  free  of  corruption.  And  its  ever 
rising  flames  having  subsided,  they  shouted,  crying, 
Praise  the  Lord,  all  his  works ;  exalt  him  more  and  more 
unto  the  ages. 

As  the  Saviour  went  to  his  Passion,  he  said  to  his  be- 
loved. If  ye  keep  my  commandments  then  all  will  know 
that  ye  are  my  Disciples.  Be  at  peace  one  with  another 
and  with  all,  and  be  of  humble  mind  that  ye  may  be 
exalted.  Know  that  I  am  the  Lord,  and  praise  and  exalt 
me  more  and  more  unto  the  ages. 

Let  it  be  contrariwise  with  you  to  the  order  of  the 
Gentiles,  in  their  lordship  over  their  kind;  for  such  are 
not  of  mine,  and  their  absolute  purpose  is  to  ursurp 
rule.  Wherefore,  whosoever  willeth  among  you  to  be 
first,  let  him  be  last  of  all.  And  know  that  I  am  the 
Lord,  and  praise  and  exalt  me  more  and  more  unto  the 
ages.

all  generations,  and  thee  we  magnify. 

O  Wisdom  of  all,  thou  didst  make  announcement  to 
thy  Disciples,  saying.  Put  away  all  the  filth  of  passion, 
and  take  unto  yourselves  a  steadfast  mind,  worthy  of  the 
divine  kingdom  wherein  ye  shall  be  glorified  and  shall 
shine  more  brightly  than  the  sun. 

Thus,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  say  to  thy  Disciples,  Look 
unto  me,  and  be  not  exalted  in  your  own  minds,  but  die 
with  the  humble.  Drink  the  cup  that  I  drink;  for  ye 
shall  be  glorified  with  me  in  my  Father's  kingdom.

take  thy  Disciples  aside  to  confirm  them,  saying, 
How  is  it  ye  do  not  remember  the  words  that  I  spake  to 
you  before;  that  no  Prophet  is  killed  except  in  Jerusa- 
lem, as  it  is  written?  And  now  the  time  hath  come  con- 
cerning which  I  told  you;  for  behold,  I  shall  be  de- 
livered to  ridicule  at  the  hands  of  sinners,  who  shall 
nail  me  upon  the  Cross,  deliver  me  to  the  tomb,  and 
account  me  dead  and  abandoned.  But  be  of  good  cheer ; 
for  I  will  rise  the  third  day,  for  the  joy  of  the  faithful, 
and  for  their  eternal  life.

unequal  to  the  mystery  of  thine  inefifable  dispensa- 
tion, begged  thee  to  grant  her  two  sons  the  honours  of  a 
temporal  kingdom.  But  instead,  thou  didst  promise  thy 
beloved  that  they  should  drink  the  cup  of  death,  the  cup 
which  thou  didst  say  thou  wouldest  drink  before  them 
for  the  purification  of  sins.  Wherefore,  we  cry  unto 
thee,  O  Salvation  of  our  souls,  glory  be  to  thee.

that  which  is  more  perfect,  and  didst  tell  them  not  to 
imitate  the  Gentiles  in  lordship  over  the  lowly,  saying, 
Let  not  that  be  among  you,  my  Disciples;  for  I  have 
become  poor  of  my  own  will.  And  the  first  among  you, 
let  him  be  servant  of  all;  the  ruler  as  one  who  is  ruled;

758  Passion  Week 

The  Gospel:    from  St.  Matthew  (24:3-35) 

A  T  that  time :  As  Jesus  sat  upon  the  Mount  of  Olives 

the  disciples  came  to  him  privately,  saying:  Tell 

us  when  shall  these  things  be?  and  what  shall  be  the  sign 

of  thy  coming,  and  of  the  consummation  of  the  world? 

And  Jesus  answering,  said  to  them  :  Take  heed  that  no 
man  seduce  you : 

For  many  will  come  in  my  name  saying,  I  am  Christ : 
and  they  will  seduce  many. 

And  you  shall  hear  of  wars  and  rumours  of  wars. 
See  that  ye  be  not  troubled.  For  these  things  must  come 
to  pass,  but  the  end  is  not  yet. 

For  nation  shall  rise  against  nation,  and  kingdom 
against  kingdom;  and  there  shall  be  pestilences,  and 
famines,  and  earthquakes  in  places: 

Now  all  these  are  the  beginnings  of  sorrows. 

Then  shall  they  deliver  you  up  to  be  afflicted,  and 
shall  put  you  to  death :  and  you  shall  be  hated  by  all 
nations  for  my  name's  sake. 

And  then  shall  many  be  scandalized :  and  shall  betray 
one  another:  and  shall  hate  one  another. 

And  many  false  prophets  shall  rise,  and  shall  seduce 
many. 

And  because  iniquity  hath  abounded,  the  charity  of 
many  shall  grow  cold. 

But  he  that  shall  persevere  to  the  end,  he  shall  be 
saved. 

And  this  gospel  of  the  kingdom,  shall  be  preached 
in  the  whole  world,  for  a  testimony  to  all  nations,  and 
then  shall  the  consummation  come. 

When  therefore  you  shall  see  the  abomination  of  des- 
olation, which  was  spoken  of  by  Daniel  the  prophet, 
standing  in  the  holy  place:  he  that  readeth  let  him 
understand. 

Then  they  that  are  in  Judea,  let  them  flee  to  the 
mountains: 

And  he  that  is  on  the  house-top,  let  him  not  come 
down  to  take  any  thing  out  of  his  house: 


Great  Holy  Monday  759 

And  he  that  is  in  the  field,  let  him  not  go  back  to  take 
his  coat. 

And  woe  to  them  that  are  with  child,  and  that  give 
suck  in  those  days. 

But  pray  that  your  flight  be  not  in  the  winter,  or  on 
the  sabbath. 

For  there  shall  be  then  great  tribulation,  such  as  hath 
not  been  from  the  beginning  of  the  world  until  now, 
neither  shall  be. 

And  unless  those  days  had  been  shortened,  no  flesh 
should  be  saved :  but  for  the  sake  of  the  elect  those  days 
shall  be  shortened. 

Then  if  any  man  shall  say  to  you :  Lo  here  is  Christ, 
or  there,  do  not  believe  him. 

For  there  shall  arise  false  Christs  and  false  prophets, 
and  shall  show  great  signs  and  wonders,  insomuch  as  to 
deceive  (if  possible)  even  the  elect. 

Behold  I  have  told  it  to  you,  beforehand. 

If  therefore  they  shall  say  to  you :  Behold  he  is  in  the 
desert,  go  ye  not  out:  Behold  he  is  in  the  closets,  believe 
it  not. 

For  as  lightning  cometh  out  of  the  east,  and  appeareth 
even  into  the  west:  so  shall  also  the  coming  of  the  Son 
of  man  be. 

Wheresoever  the  body  shall  be,  there  shall  the  eagles 
also  be  gathered  together. 

And  immediately  after  the  tribulation  of  those  days, 
the  sun  shall  be  darkened  and  the  moon  shall  not  give 
her  light,  and  the  stars  shall  fall  from  heaven,  and  the 
powers  of  heaven  shall  be  moved: 

And  then  shall  appear  the  sign  of  the  Son  of  man  in 
heaven:  and  then  shall  all  tribes  of  the  earth  mourn: 
and  they  shall  see  the  Son  of  man  coming  in  the  clouds 
of  heaven  with  much  power  and  majesty. 

And  he  shall  send  his  angels  with  a  trumpet,  and  a 
great  voice:  and  they  shall  gather  together  his  elect 
from  the  four  winds,  from  the  farthest  parts  of  the  hea- 
vens to  the  utmost  bounds  of  them. 


760  Passion  Week 

And  from  the  fig  tree  learn  a  parable:  When  the 
branch  thereof  is  now  tender,  and  the  leaves  come  forth, 
you  know  that  summer  is  nigh. 

So  you  also,  when  you  shall  see  all  these  things,  know 
ye  that  it  is  nigh,  even  at  the  doors. 

Amen  I  say  to  you,  that  this  generation  shall  not  pass, 
till  all  these  things  be  done. 

Heaven  and  earth  shall  pass,  but  my  words  shall  not 
pass.

^After  Great  Compline,  the  Bridegroom  Service  taketh  place,  after 
the  Order  for  the  evening  of  Palm  Sunday  (p.  747);  and  after, 
Behold  the  Bridegroom,  etc.  (p.  749),  chant  the  following  Kathis- 
mata,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

T  ET  us  admire  and  love  the  Bridegroom,  brethren, 
preparing  our  lamps  to  shine  with  virtues  and  the 
Orthodox  Faith,  that,  like  the  wise  virgins  of  the  Lord, 
we  may  be  ready  to  enter  with  him  to  the  wedding;  for 
the  Bridegroom,  being  God,  granteth  to  all  an  incor- 
ruptible crown. 

The  priests  and  scribes,  O  Christ,  through  great  envy, 
brought  against  thee  a  Council  deviating  from  the 
law,  moving  Judas  to  the  Betrayal.  Wherefore,  he  went 
out  with  audacity  and  spake  to  those  law-transgressing 
people,  saying.  What  will  ye  give  me,  and  I  will  deliver 
him  into  your  hands?  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  save  our 
souls  from  his  condemnation. 

CAnd  the  following,  in  the  Eighth  Tone  (repeated). 

JUDAS  that  evil  enemy,  was  moved  by  a  silver-loving 
mind.  He  planned  by  conspiracy,  the  Betrayal  of  the 
Master,  and  fell  from  the  light,  accepting  darkness.  And 
having  bargained  for  the  sale,  he  sold  the  priceless  One. 
Wherefore,  that  wretched  man  found  hanging  and  hor- 
rible death  a  reward  of  his  deed.  Save  us,  therefore,  O 
Christ,  from  his  company,  and  grant  forgiveness  of  sins 
to  those  who  eagerly  celebrate  thy  pure  Passion.

Great  Holy  Monday  761 

The  Gospel:    from  St.  Matthew 
(22:15  to  end;  23:1  to  end) 

AT  that  time:  The  Pharisees  took  counsel  how  they 

might  entangle  Christ  in  his  talk. 

And  they  sent  out  unto  him  their  disciples  with  the 

Herodians,  saying,  Master,  we  know  that  thou  art  true, 

and  teachest  the  way  of  God  in  truth,  neither  carest  thou 

for  any  man:  for  thou  regardest  not  the  person  of  men. 

Tell  us  therefore,  What  thinkest  thou?  Is  it  lawful  to 

give   tribute  unto  Caesar,  or  not? 

But  Jesus  perceived  their  wickedness,  and  said,  Why 
tempt  ye  me,  ye  hypocrites? 

Show  me  the  tribute  money.  And  they  brought  unto 
him  a  penny. 

And  he  saith  unto  them.  Whose  is  this  image  and 
superscription? 

They  say  unto  him,  Caesar's.  Then  saith  he  unto 
them.  Render  therefore  unto  Caesar  the  things  which  are 
Caesar's;  and  unto  God  the  things  that  are  God's. 

When  they  had  heard  these  words,  they  marveled, 
and  left  him,  and  went  their  way. 

The  same  day  came  to  him  the  Sadducees,  which 
say  that  there  is  no  resurrection,  and  asked  him. 

Saying,  Master,  Moses  said.  If  a  man  die,  having  no 
children,  his  brother  shall  marry  his  wife,  and  raise  up 
seed  unto  his  brother. 

Now  there  were  with  us  seven  brethren :  and  the  first, 
when  he  had  married  a  wife,  deceased,  and  having  no 
issue,  left  his  wife  unto  his  brother: 

Likewise  the  second  also,  and  the  third,  unto  the  sev- 
enth. 

And  last  of  all  the  woman  died  also. 
Therefore  in  the  resurrection,  whose  wife  shall  she 
be  of  the  seven?  for  they  all  had  her. 

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  them,  Ye  do  err,  not 
knowing  the  Scriptures,  nor  the  power  of  God. 

For  in  the  resurrection  they  neither  marry,  nor  are 
given  in  marriage,  but  are  as  the  angels  of  God  in  hea- 
ven. 


762  Passion  Week 

But  as  touching  the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  have  ye 
not  read  that  which  was  spoken  unto  you  by  God,  say- 
ing, 

I  am  the  God  of  Abraham,  and  the  God  of  Isaac,  and 
the  God  of  Jacob?  God  is  not  the  God  of  the  dead,  but 
of  the  living. 

And  when  the  multitude  heard  this,  they  were  aston- 
ished at  his  doctrine. 

But  when  the  Pharisees  had  heard  that  he  had  put 
the  Sadducees  to  silence,  they  were  gathered  together. 

Then  one  of  them,  which  was  a  lawyer,  asked  him  a 
question,  tempting  him,  and  saying. 

Master,  which  is  the  great  commandment  in  the  law? 

Jesus  said  unto  him.  Thou  shalt  love  the  Lord  thy 
God  with  all  thy  heart,  and  with  all  thy  soul,  and  with 
all  thy  mind. 

This  is  the  first  and  great  commandment. 

And  the  second  is  like  unto  it,  Thou  shalt  love  thy 
neighbour  as  thyself. 

On  these  two  commandments  hang  all  the  law  and  the 
prophets. 

While  the  Pharisees  were  gathered  together,  Jesus 
asked  them, 

Saying,  What  think  ye  of  Christ?  whose  son  is  he? 
They  say  unto  him.  The  son  of  David. 

He  saith  unto  them,  How  then  doth  David  in  spirit 
call  him  Lord,  saying. 

The  Lord  said  unto  my  Lord,  Sit  thou  on  my  right 
hand,  till  I  make  thine  enemies  thy  footstool? 

If  David  then  call  him  Lord,  how  is  he  his  son? 

And  no  man  was  able  to  answer  him  a  word,  neither 
durst  any  man  from  that  day  forth  ask  him  any  more 
questions. 

Then  spake  Jesus  to  the  multitude,  and  to  his  dis- 
ciples. 

Saying,  The  scribes  and  the  Pharisees  sit  in  Moses' 
seat : 


i 


Great  Holy  Monday  763 

All  therefore  whatsoever  they  bid  you  observe,  that 
observe  and  do ;  but  do  not  ye  after  their  works :  for  they 
say,  and  do  not. 

For  they  bind  heavy  burdens  and  grievous  to  be 
borne,  and  lay  them  on  men's  shoulders;  but  they  them- 
selves will  not  move  them  with  one  of  their  fingers. 

But  all  their  works  they  do  for  to  be  seen  of  men :  they 
make  broad  their  phylacteries,  and  enlarge  the  borders 
of  their  garments. 

And  love  the  uppermost  rooms  at  feasts,  and  the  chief 
seats  in  the  synagogues. 

And  greetings  in  the  markets,  and  to  be  called  of  men. 
Rabbi,  Rabbi. 

But  be  not  ye  called  Rabbi:  for  one  is  your  Master, 
even  Christ;  and  all  ye  are  brethren. 

And  call  no  man  your  father  upon  the  earth:  for  one 
is  your  Father,  which  is  in  heaven. 

Neither  be  ye  called  masters :  for  one  is  your  Master, 
even  Christ. 

But  he  that  is  greatest  among  you  shall  be  your  serv- 
ant. 

And  whosoever  shall  exalt  himself  shall  be  abased; 
and  he  that  shall  humble  himself  shall  be  exalted. 

But  woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
for  ye  shut  up  the  kingdom  of  heaven  against  men:  for 
ye  neither  go  in  yourselves,  neither  sufifer  ye  them  that 
are  entering  to  go  in. 

Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
for  ye  devour  widows'  houses,  and  for  a  pretense  make 
long  prayer :  therefore  ye  shall  receive  the  greater  dam- 
nation. 

Woe  unto  you  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites!  for 
ye  compass  sea  and  land  to  make  one  proselyte;  and 
when  he  is  made,  ye  make  him  twofold  more  the  child 
of  hell  than  yourselves. 

Woe  unto  you,  ye  blind  guides,  which  say.  Whosoever 
shall  swear  by  the  temple,  it  is  nothing;  but  whosoever 
shall  swear  by  the  gold  of  the  temple,  he  is  a  debtor! 


764  Passion  Week 

Ye  fools  and  blind :  for  whether  is  greater,  the  gold, 
or  the  temple  that  sanctifieth  the  gold? 

And,  Whosoever  shall  swear  by  the  altar,  it  is  no- 
thing; but  whosoever  sweareth  by  the  gift  that  is  upon 
it,  he  is  guilty. 

Ye  fools  and  blind :  for  whether  is  greater,  the  gift,  or 
the  altar  that  sanctifieth  the  gift? 

Whoso  therefore  shall  swear  by  the  altar,  sweareth 
by  it,  and  by  all  things  thereon. 

And  whoso  shall  swear  by  the  temple,  sweareth  by  it, 
and  by  him  that  dwelleth  therein. 

And  he  that  shall  swear  by  heaven,  sweareth  by  the 
throne  of  God,  and  by  him  that  sitteth  thereon. 

Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
for  ye  pay  tithe  of  mint  and  anise  and  cummin,  and  have 
omitted  the  weightier  matters  of  the  law,  judgment, 
mercy,  and  faith  :  these  ought  ye  to  have  done,  and  not  to 
leave  the  other  undone. 

Ye  blind  guides,  which  strain  at  a  gnat,  and  swallow 
a  camel. 

Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
for  ye  make  clean  the  outside  of  the  cup  and  of  the  plat- 
ter, but  within  they  are  full  of  extortion  and  excess. 

Thou  blind  Pharisees,  cleanse  first  that  which  is 
within  the  cup  and  platter,  that  the  outside  of  them  may 
be  clean  also. 

Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
for  ye  are  like  unto  whited  sepulchres,  which  indeed 
appear  beautiful  outwardly,  but  are  within  full  of  dead 
men's  bones,  and  of  all  uncleanness. 

Even  so  ye  also  outwardly  appear  righteous  unto  rrien, 
but  within  ye  are  full  of  hypocrisy  and  iniquity. 

Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites! 
because  ye  build  the  tombs  of  the  prophets,  and  garnish 
the  sepulchres  of  the  righteous. 

And  say,  If  we  had  been  in  the  days  of  our  fathers,  we 
would  not  have  been  partakers  with  them  in  the  blood 
of  the  prophets.

Wherefore  ye  be  witnesses  unto  yourselves,  that  ye 
are  the  children  of  them  which  killed  the  prophets. 

Fill  ye  up  then  the  measure  of  your  fathers.

cape the  damnation  of  hell? 

Wherefore,  behold,  I  send  unto  you  prophets,  and 
wise  men,  and  scribes:  and  some  of  them  ye  shall  kill 
and  crucify;  and  some  of  them  shall  ye  scourge  in  your 
synagogues,  and  persecute  them  from  city  to  city: 

That  upon  vou  may  come  all  the  righteous  blood  shed 
upon  the  earth,  from  the  blood  of  righteous  Abel  unto 
the  blood  of  Zacharias  son  of  Barachias,  whom  ye  slew 
between  the  temple  and  the  altar. 

Verily  I  say  unto  you,  All  these  things  shall  come 
upon  this  generation. 

O  Jerusalem,  Jerusalem,  thou  that  killest  the  pro- 
phets, and  stonest  them  which  are  sent  unto  thee,  how 
often  would  I  have  gathered  thy  children  together,  even 
as  a  hen  gathereth  her  chickens  under  her  wings,  and 
ye  would  not! 

Behold,  your  house  is  left  unto  you  desolate. 

For  I  sav  unto  you,  Ye  shall  not  see  me  henceforth, 
till  ve  shall  say.  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh  in  the  name  of

/^N  this  day  we  make  remembrance  of  the  Parable 
of  the  Ten  Virgins  which  Jesus  spake  along  with 
others  as  he  was  coming  to  the  Passion.  It  teaches  us 
not  to  rest  as  though  safe  in  virginity,  but  to  guard  it 
whenever  possible,  and  not  to  desist  from  any  virtues 
and  good  deeds,  especially  deeds  of  mercy,  which  make 
the  lamp  of  virginity  shine  brilliantly.  It  teaches  us 
also  to  be  ready  for  our  end,  not  knowing  when  our 
hour  is  coming,  as  the  wise  virgins  were  ready  to  meet 
the  bride,  lest  death  overtake  us  and  close  the  door  of

The  Gospel :    from  St.  Matthew 
(24:36  to  end;  25:1  to  end;  26:1-2) 

nPHE  Lord  saith  to  his  disciples:  That  day  and  hour 
no  one  knoweth,  not  the  angels  of  heaven,  but  the 
Father  alone. 

And  as  in  the  days  of  Noe,  so  shall  also  the  coming 
of  the  Son  of  man  be. 

For  as  in  the  days  before  the  flood,  they  were  eating 
and  drinking,  marrying  and  giving  in  marriage,  even 
till  that  day  in  which  Noe  entered  into  the  ark. 

And  they  knew  not  till  the  flood  came,  and  took  them 
all  away;  so  also  shall  the  coming  of  the  Son  of  man  be. 

Then  two  shall  be  in  the  field :  one  shall  be  taken,  and 
one  shall  be  left. 

Two  women  shall  be  grinding  at  the  mill:  one  shall 
be  taken,  and  one  shall  be  left. 

Watch  ye  therefore,  because  you  know  not  what  hour 
your  Lord  will  come. 

But  this  know  ye,  that  if  the  goodman  of  the  house 
knew  at  what  hour  the  thief  would  come,  he  would 
certainly  watch,  and  would  not  sufifer  his  house  to  be 
broken  open. 


770  Passion  Week 

Wherefore  be  you  also  ready,  because  at  what  hour 
you  know  not  the  Son  of  man  will  come. 

Who,  thinkest  thou,  is  a  faithful  and  wise  servant, 
whom  his  lord  hath  appointed  over  his  family,  to  give 
them  meat  in  season. 

Blessed  is  that  servant,  whom  when  his  lord  shall 
come  he  shall  find  so  doing. 

Amen  I  say  to  you,  he  shall  place  him  over  all  his 
goods. 

But  if  that  evil  servant  shall  say  in  his  heart:  My 
lord  is  long  a  coming: 

And  shall  begin  to  strike  his  fellow  servants,  and  shall 
eat  and  drink  with  drunkards: 

The  lord  of  that  servant  shall  come  in  a  day  that  he 
hoped  not,  and  at  an  hour  that  he  knoweth  not: 

And  shall  separate  him,  and  appoint  his  portion  with 
the  hypocrites.  There  shall  be  weeping  and  gnashing 
of  teeth. 

Then  shall  the  kingdom  of  heaven  be  like  to  ten  vir- 
gins, who  taking  their  lamps  went  out  to  meet  the  bride- 
groom and  the  bride. 

And  five  of  them  were  foolish,  and  five  wise. 

But  the  five  foolish,  having  taken  their  lamps,  did  not 
take  oil  with  them. 

But  the  wise  took  oil  in  their  vessels  with  the  lamps. 

And  the  bridegroom  tarrying,  they  all  slumbered  and 
slept. 

And  at  midnight  there  was  a  cry  made:  Behold  the 
bridegroom  cometh,  go  ye  forth  to  meet  him. 

Then  all  those  virgins  arose  and  trimmed  their  lamps. 

And  the  foolish  said  to  the  wise:  Give  us  of  your  oil, 
for  our  lamps  are  gone  out. 

The  wise  answered,  saying:  Lest  perhaps  there  be 
not  enough  for  us  and  for  you,  go  ye  rather  to  them  that 
sell,  and  buy  for  yourselves. 

Now  whilst  they  went  to  buv,  the  bridegroom  came: 
and  they  that  were  ready,  went  in  with  him  to  the  mar- 
riage, and  the  door  was  shut 


Great  Holy  Tuesday  771 

But  at  last  came  also  the  other  virgins,  saying:  Lord, 
Lord,  open  to  us. 

But  he  answering  said:  Amen  I  say  to  you,  I  know 
you  not. 

Watch  ye  therefore,  because  you  know  not  the  day 
nor  the  hour  the  Son  of  man  will  come.  Then  the  Lord 
saith  this  parable:  A  man  travelling  called  his  servants, 
and  delivered  unto  them  his  goods; 

And  to  one  he  gave  five  talents,  and  to  another  two, 
and  to  another  one,  to  every  one  according  to  his  proper 
ability:  and  immediately  he  took  his  journey. 

And  he  that  had  received  the  five  talents,  went  his 
way,  and  traded  with  the  same,  and  gained  other  five. 

And  in  like  manner  he  that  had  received  the  two, 
gained  other  two. 

But  he  that  had  received  the  one,  going  his  way 
digged  into  the  earth,  and  hid  his  lord's  money. 

But  after  a  long  time  the  lord  of  those  servants  came, 
and  reckoned  with  them. 

And  he  that  had  received  the  five  talents  coming, 
brought  other  five  talents,  saying:  Lord,  thou  didst  de- 
liver to  me  five  talents,  behold  I  have  gained  other  five 
over  and  above. 

His  lord  said  to  him:  Well  done,  good  and  faithful 
servant:  because  thou  hast  been  faithful  over  a  few 
things,  I  will  place  thee  over  many  things:  enter  thou 
into  the  joy  of  thy  lord. 

And  he  also  that  had  received  the  two  talents  came 
and  said :  Lord,  thou  deliveredst  two  talents  to  me :  be- 
hold I  have  gained  other  two. 

His  lord  said  to  him:  Well  done,  good  and  faithful 
servant:  because  thou  hast  been  faithful  over  a  few 
things,  I  will  place  thee  over  many  things:  enter  thou 
into  the  joy  of  thy  lord. 

But  he  that  had  received  the  one  talent,  came  and 
said  :  Lord,  I  know  that  thou  art  a  hard  man ;  thou  reap- 
est  where  thou  hast  not  sown,  and  gatherest  where  thou 
hast  not  strewed. 


772  Passion  Week 

And  being  afraid  I  went  and  hid  thy  talent  in  the 
earth :  behold  here  thou  hast  which  is  thine. 

And  his  lord  answering,  said  to  him':  Wicked  and 
slothful  servant,  thou  knewest  that  I  reap  where  I  sow 
not,  and  gather  where  I  have  not  strewed : 

Thou  oughtest  therefore  to  have  committed  my 
money  to  the  bankers,  and  at  my  coming  I  should  have 
received  my  own  with  usury. 

Take  ye  away  therefore  the  talent  from  him,  and  give 
it  him  that  hath  ten  talents. 

For  to  every  one  that  hath  shall  be  given,  and  he  shall 
abound:  but  from  him  that  hath  not,  that  also  which 
he  seemeth  to  have  shall  be  taken  away. 

And  the  unprofitable  servant  cast  ye  out  into  the  ex- 
terior darkness.  There  shall  be  weeping  and  gnashing 
of  teeth. 

And  when  the  Son  of  man  shall  come  in  his  majesty, 
and  all  the  angels  with  him,  then  shall  he  sit  upon  the 
seat  of  his  majesty: 

And  all  nations  shall  be  gathered  together  before 
him,  and  he  shall  separate  them  one  from  another,  as 
the  shepherd  separateth  the  sheep  from  the  goats: 

And  he  shall  set  the  sheep  on  his  right  hand,  but  the 
goats  on  his  left. 

Then  shall  the  king  say  to  them  that  shall  be  on  his 
right  hand :  Come,  ye  blessed  of  my  Father,  possess  you 
the  kingdom  prepared  for  you  from  the  foundation  of 
the  world. 

For  I  was  hungry,  and  you  gave  me  to  eat;  I  was 
thirsty,  and  you  gave  me  to  drink;  I  was  a  stranger,  and 
you  took  me  in : 

Naked,  and  you  covered  me:  sick,  and  you  visited 
me:  I  was  in  prison,  and  you  came  to  me. 

Then  shall  the  just  answer  him,  saying:  Lord,  when 
did  we  see  thee  hungry,  and  fed  thee;  thirsty,  and  gave 
thee  drink? 

And  when  did  we  see  thee  a  stranger,  and  took  thee 
in?  or  naked,  and  covered  thee? 


Great  Holy  Tuesday  773 

Or  when  did  we  see  thee  sick  or  in  prison,  and  came 
to  thee? 

And  the  king  answering,  shall  say  to  them :  Amen  I 
say  to  you,  as  long  as  you  did  it  to  one  of  these  my  least 
brethren,  you  did  it  to  me. 

Then  he  shall  say  to  them  also  that  shall  be  on  his 
left  hand  :  Depart  from  me,  you  cursed,  into  everlasting 
fire  which  was  prepared  for  the  devil  and  his  angels. 

For  I  was  hungry,  and  you  gave  me  not  to  eat:  I  was 
thirsty,  and  you  gave  me  not  to  drink. 

I  was  a  stranger,  and  you  took  me  not  in:  naked,  and 
you  covered  me  not:  sick  and  in  prison,  and  you  did  not 
visit  me. 

Then  they  also  shall  answer  him,  saying:  Lord,  when 
did  we  see  thee  hungry,  or  thirsty,  or  a  stranger,  or 
naked,  or  sick,  or  in  prison,  and  did  not  minister  to  thee? 

Then  he  shall  answer  them,  saying:  Amen  I  say  to 
you,  as  long  as  you  did  it  not  to  one  of  these  least,  nei- 
ther did  you  do  it  to  me. 

And  these  shall  go  into  everlasting  punishment:  but 
the  just,  into  life  everlasting. 

And  it  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  ended  all  these 
words,  he  said  to  his  disciples: 

You  know  that  after  two  days  shall  be  the  pasch,  and 
the  son  of  man  shall  be  delivered  up  to  be  crucified.

The  Gospel:    from  St.  John  (12:17  to  end) 

A  T  that  time :  The  people  that  was  with  Jesus  when 
he  called  Lazarus  out  of  his  grave,  and  raised  him 
from  the  dead,  bare  record. 

For  this  cause  the  people  also  met  him,  for  that  they 
heard  that  he  had  done  this  miracle. 

The  Pharisees  therefore  said  among  themselves.  Per- 
ceive ye  how  ye  prevail  nothing?  behold,  the  world 
is  gone  after  him. 

And  there  were  certain  Greeks  among  them  that  came 
up  to  worship  at  the  feast: 

The  same  came  therefore  to  Philip,  which  was  of 
Bethsaida  of  Galilee,  and  desired  him,  saying.  Sir,  we 
would  see  Jesus. 

Philip  Cometh  and  telleth  Andrew:  and  again  An- 
drew and  Philip  tell  Jesus. 

And  Jesus  answered  them,  saying,  The  hour  is  come, 
that  the  Son  of  man  should  be  glorified. 


Great  Holy  Tuesday  775. 

Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you,  Except  a  corn  of  wheat 
fall  into  the  ground  and  die,  it  abideth  alone:  but  if 
it  die,  it  bringeth  forth  much  fruit. 

He  that  loveth  his  life  shall  lose  it;  and  he  that  hateth 
his  life  in  this  world  shall  keep  it  unto  life  eternal. 

If  any  man  serve  me,  let  him  follow  me;  and  where  I 
am,  there  shall  also  my  servant  be :  if  any  man  serve  me, 
him  will  my  Father  honour. 

Now  is  my  soul  troubled;  and  what  shall  I  say? 
Father,  save  me  from  this  hour:  but  for  this  cause  came 
I  unto  this  hour. 

Father,  glorify  thy  name.  Then  came  there  a  voice 
from  heaven,  saying,  I  have  both  glorified  it,  and  will 
glorify  it  again. 

The  people  therefore  that  stood  by,  and  heard  it,  said 
that  it  thundered :  others  said,  An  angel  spake  to  him. 

Jesus  answered  and  said,  This  voice  came  not  be- 
cause of  me,  but  for  your  sakes. 

Now  is  the  judgment  of  this  world:  now  shall  the 
prince  of  this  world  be  cast  out. 

And  I,  if  I  be  lifted  up  from  the  earth,  will  draw  all 
men  unto  me. 

This  he  said,  signifying  what  death  he  should  die. 

The  people  answered  him.  We  have  heard  out  of  the 
law  that  Christ  abideth  for  ever:  and  how  sayest  thou, 
The  Son  of  man  must  be  lifted  up?  who  is  this  Son  of 
man? 

Then  Jesus  said  unto  them.  Yet  a  little  while  is  the 
light  with  you.  Walk  while  ye  have  the  light,  lest  dark- 
ness come  upon  you :  for  he  that  walketh  in  darkness 
knoweth  not  whither  he  goeth. 

While  ye  have  light,  believe  in  the  light,  that  ye  may 
be  the  children  of  light.  These  things  spake  Jesus,  and 
departed,  and  did  hide  himself  from  them. 

But  though  he  had  done  so  many  miracles  before 
them,  yet  they  believed  not  on  him: 

That  the  saying  of  Esaias  the  prophet  might  be  ful- 
filled, which  he  spake,  Lord,  who  hath  believed  our 


776  Passion  Week 

report?  and  to  whom  hath  the  arm  of  the  Lord  been 
revealed? 

Therefore  they  could  not  believe,  because  that  Esaias 
said  again, 

He  hath  blinded  their  eyes,  and  hardened  their  heart; 
that  they  should  not  see  with  their  eyes,  nor  understand 
with  their  hearts,  and  be  converted,  and  I  should  heal 
them. 

These  things  said  Esaias,  when  he  saw  his  glory,  and 
spake  of  him. 

Nevertheless  among  the  chief  rulers  also  many  be- 
lieved on  him;  but  because  of  the  Pharisees  they  did  not 
confess  him,  lest  they  should  be  put  out  of  the  syna- 
gogue : 

For  they  loved  the  praise  of  men  more  than  the  praise 
of  God. 

Jesus  cried  and  said,  He  that  believeth  on  me,  be- 
lieveth  not  on  me,  but  on  him  that  sent  me. 

And  he  that  seeth  me  seeth  him  that  sent  me. 

I  am  come  a  light  into  the  world,  that  whosoever 
believeth  on  me  should  not  abide  in  darkness. 

And  if  any  man  hear  my  words,  and  believe  not,  I 
judge  him  not:  for  I  came  not  to  judge  the  world,  but 
to  save  the  world. 

He  that  rejecteth  me,  and  receiveth  not  my  words, 
hath  one  that  judgeth  him :  the  word  that  I  have  spoken, 
the  same  shall  judge  him  in  the  last  day. 

For  I  have  not  spoken  of  myself;  but  the  Father 
which  sent  me,  he  gave  me  a  command,  what  I  should 
say,  and  what  I  should  speak. 

And  I  know  that  his  commandment  is  life  everlast-

Third  Ode — Hermos 

nPHOU  hast  established  me  upon  the  rock  of  faith, 
and  hast  enlarged  my  mouth  over  mine  enemies; 
for  my  soul  rejoiceth  in  her  own  singing.  There  is 
none  holy  as  the  Lord,  and  there  is  none  righteous  be- 
side thee,  O  Lord. 

Verily,  the  law-deviating  Council  is  false,  and  hath 
met  with  an  evil  mind,  to  show  thee  guilty,  O  Christ 
the  Rescuer,  to  whom  we  sing.  Thou  art  our  God,  and 
there  is  none  holy  beside  thee,  O  Lord. 

Verily,  the  wicked,  law-transgressing  Council,  since 
their  souls  are  wicked  and  God-contending,  conspired 
to  kill  Christ  the  Righteous  as  one  lacking  goodness. 
Wherefore,  to  him  we  sing.  Thou  art  our  God,  and 
there  is  none  holy  beside  thee,  O  Lord.

T  HAVE  sinned  against  thee,  O  good  One,  more  than 
the  adulterous  woman,  and  have  not  even  offered 
thee  a  flood  of  tears.  But  silently  and  calmly  I  kneel 
asking,  kissing  thy  pure  feet  with  longing,  that  thou 
mayest  grant  me,  O  Saviour,  since  thou  art  the  Master, 
remission  of  my  sins,  who  cry.  Deliver  me  from  the 
mire  of  my  deeds. 

Oikos:  The  shameless  woman  of  old  suddenly  ap- 
peared chaste,  despising  her  horrible  deeds  of  sin  and 
the  pleasures  of  the  body,  contemplating  her  great 
shame  and  the  condemnation  of  punishment  which  the 
adulterous  and  insolent,  of  whom  I  am  first,  endure.  I 
tremble  thereat;  yet  I  who  am  ignorant  am  confirmed 
in  my  evil  habits.  But  the  adulterous  woman  trembled 
with  fear,  and  hastened  to  her  Rescuer,  crying,  O  Lover 
of  mankind,  rescue  me  from  the  mire  of  my  deeds.

days  before.  One  0)f  these  was  a  harlot,  while  the  other 
was  a  chaste,  virtuous  woman.  On  this  day  the  Church 
commemorates  this  act  of  piety  and  righteousness  which 
proceeded  from  the  harlot,  contrasting  it  with  the 
treachery  of  Judas  aind  his  Betrayal  of  Christ.  Both  of 
these  acts  fell  on  Wednesday,  corresponding  to  the 
twenty-first  of  March,  two  days  before  the  Mosaic  pass- 
over,  as  it  appears  from  the  course  of  the  account  of  St. 
Matthew  the  Evangelist. 

The  above  mentioned  harlot  anointed  the  head  and 
feet  of  Jesus  with  spikenard,  and  wiped  them  with  the 
hair  of  her  head.  The  precious  ointment  was  worth 
three  hundred  dinars,  or  about  fifteen  pieces  of  Vene- 
tian gold.  When  the  Disciples  saw  this  they  stumbled, 
especially  Judas,  the  money-lover,  and  were  angry  be- 
cause of  the  wasting  of  such  an  amount  of  ointment. 
Jesus  rebuked  them,  lest  the  woman  be  embarrassed. 
Judas  was  wroth,  and  went  to  the  high  priests,  where 
they  were  gathered  in  the  house  of  Caiphas,  taking 
counsel  against  Jesus,  and  agreed  with  them  to  deliver 
the  Master  for  thirty  pieces  of  silver.  From  that  time 
Judas  sought  an  opportunity  to  deliver  him  (St.  Mt. 
26:2-16).  Because  of  this  the  fast  of  Wednesday  was 
instituted  from  the  days  of  the  apostolic  age  itself. 

Wherefore,  O  Christ  God,  anointed  with  the  super- 
sensuous  ointment,  deliver  us  from  suffering,  and  have 
mercy  upon  us. 

Eighth  Ode — Hermos 

^IT'ERILY,  the  furnace  of  old  was  heated  sevenfold 
by  the  usurper's  command,  and  in  it  the  youths  were 
not  burned,  but  they  trod  at  the  command  of  the  king, 
shouting,  Praise  the  Lord,  all  his  works;  exalt  him 
more  and  more  unto  the  ages. 

The  adulterous  woman,  O  Christ,  poured  precious 
ointment  on  thy  divine,  terrible,  lordly  head.  She  held 
thy  pure  feet  with  her  defiled  hands  and  cried,  Bless 
the  Lord,  all  his  works,  and  exalt  him  more  and  more 
unto  the  ages.

said  to  them,  What  will  ye  give  me  to  deliver  to  you  the 
Christ  whom  ye  seek,  exchanging  his  adoption  for  gold. 
Wherefore,  O  Christ  God,  have  pity  on  our  souls  and

the  Virgin,  she  shouted  with  tears,  imploring,  hav-

my  debt  as  I  have  loosed  my  braids.  Love  thou  her 
who  is  justly  hated,  that  I  may  make  a  vow  to  thee  with 
the  publicans,  O  Benefactor  and  Lover  of  mankind. 

When  the  adulteress  mixed  her  tears  with  ointment  of 
great  price  and  poured  it  over  thy  pure  feet,  kissing 
them,  immediately  thou  didst  justify  her.  Wherefore, 
grant  us  forgiveness,  O  thou  who  didst  suffer  for  us, 
and  save  us. 

When  the  sinful  woman  was  offering  her  spice,  the

price,  while  the  other  hastened  to  sell  the  priceless 
One.  The  one  knew  the  Lord,  the  other  was  separated 
from  the  Lord.  She  was  freed  and  Judas  became  a 
slave  to  the  enemy.  Indifference  is  evil,  and  repentance 
is  great,  which  last  grant  us,  O  Saviour,  who  didst  suf- 
fer for  us,  and  save  us. 

Ah  for  the  wretchedness  of  Judas!  For,  seeing  the 
adulteress  kiss  the  traces  of  his  feet,  he  was  thinking 
with  deceit  of  the  kiss  of  betrayal.  She  loosed  her  braids, 
and  he  was  bound  with  wrath,  offering  instead  of  spice, 
rotted  evil;  for  envy  knoweth  not  how  to  honour  the 
seemly.  Woe  to  the  wretchedness  of  Judas,  and  from

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Luke  (22:1-39) 

A  T  that  time:  The  feast  of  unleavened  bread,  which 
is  called  the  pasch,  was  at  hand. 

And  the  chief  priests  and  the  scribes  sought  how  they 
might  put  Jesus  to  death :  but  they  feared  the  people. 

And  Satan  entered  into  Judas,  who  was  surnamed 
Iscariot,  one  of  the  twelve. 

And  he  went,  and  discoursed  with  the  chief  priests 
and  the  magistrates,  how  he  might  betray  him  to  them^ 

And  they  were  glad,  and  covenanted  to  give  him 
money. 

And  he  promised.  And  he  sought  opportunity  to 
betray  him  in  the  absence  of  the  multitude. 

And  the  day  of  the  unleavened  bread  came,  on  which 
it  was  necessary  that  the  pasch  should  be  killed. 

And  he  sent  Peter  and  John,  saying:  Go,  and  pre- 
pare for  us  the  pasch,  that  we  may  eat. 

But  they  said :  Where  wilt  thou  that  we  prepare? 

And  he  said  to  them :  Behold,  as  you  go  into  the  city, 
there  shall  meet  you  a  man  carrying  a  pitcher  of  water : 
follow  him  into  the  house  where  he  entereth  in. 

And  you  shall  say  to  the  goodman  of  the  house :  The 
master  saith  to  thee.  Where  is  the  guest  chamber,  where 
I  may  eat  the  pasch  with  my  disciples? 

And  he  will  shew  you  a  large  dining  room,  furnished ; 
and  there  prepare. 

And  they  going,  found  asi  he  had  said  to  them,  and 
made  ready  the  pasch. 

And  when  the  hour  was  come,  he  sat  down,  and  the 
twelve  apostles  with  him. 

And  he  said  to  them:  With  desire  I  have  desired  to 
eat  this  pasch  with  you,  before  I  suffer. 

For  I  say  to  you,  that  from  this  time  I  will  not  eat 
it,  till  it  be  fulfilled  in  the  kingdom  of  God. 

And  having  taken  the  chalice,  he  gave  thanks,  and 
said :  Take,  and  divide  it  among  you : 

For  I  say  to  you,  that  I  will  not  drink  of  the  fruit  of 
the  vine,  till  the  kingdom  of  God  come. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  785 

And  taking  bread,  he  gave  thanks,  and  brake;  and 
gave  to  them,  saying:  This  is  my  body,  which  is  given 
for  you.    Do  this  for  a  commemoration  of  me. 

In  like  manner  the  chalice  also,  after  he  had  supped, 
saying:  This  is  the  chalice,  the  new^  testament  in  my 
blood,  which  shall  be  shed  for  you. 

But  yet  behold,  the  hand  of  him  that  betrayeth  me  is 
with  me  on  the  table. 

And  the  Son  of  man  indeed  goeth,  according  to  that 
which  is  determined :  but  yet,  woe  to  that  man  by  whom 
he  shall  be  betrayed. 

And  they  began  to  inquire  among  themselves,  which 
of  them  it  was  that  should  do  this  thing. 

And  there  was  also  a  strife  amongst  them,  which  of 
them  should  seem  to  be  the  greater. 

And  he  said  to  them :  The  kings  of  the  Gentiles  lord 
it  over  them;  and  they  that  have  power  over  them,  are 
called  beneficent. 

But  you  not  so :  but  he  that  is  the  greater  among  you, 
let  him  become  as  the  younger ;  and  he  that  is  the  leader, 
as  he  that  serveth. 

For  which  is  greater,  he  that  sitteth  at  table,  or  he 
that  serveth?  Is  not  he  that  sitteth  at  table?  But  I  am 
in  the  midst  of  you,  as  he  that  serveth: 

And  you  are  they  who  have  continued  with  me  in  my 
temptations : 

And  I  dispose  to  you,  as  my  Father  hath  disposed  to 
me,  a  kingdom; 

That  you  may  eat  and  drink  at  my  table,  in  my  king- 
dom:  and  may  sit  upon  thrones,  judging  the  twelve 
tribes  of  Israel. 

And  the  Lord  said :  Simon,  Simon,  behold  Satan  hath 
desired  to  have  you,  that  he  may  sift  you  as  wheat: 

But  I  have  prayed  for  thee,  that  thy  faith  fail  not: 
and  thou,  being  once  converted,  confirm  thy  brethren. 

Who  said  to  him:  Lord,  I  am  ready  to  go  with  thee, 
both  into  prison,  and  to  death.

And  he  said:  I  say  to  thee,  Peter,  the  cock  shall  not 
crow  this  day,  till  thou  thrice  deniest  that  thou  knowest 
me.    And  he  said  to  them : 

When  I  sent  you  without  purse,  and  scrip,  and  shoes, 
did  you  want  any  thing? 

But  they  said:  Nothing.  Then  said  he  unto  them: 
But  now  he  that  hath  a  purse,  let  him  take  it,  and  like- 
wise a  scrip;  and  he  that  hath  not,  let  him  sell  his  coat, 
and  buy  a  sword. 

For  I  say  to  you,  that  this  that  is  written  must  yet  be 
fulfilled  in  me:  And  with  the  wicked  was  he  reckoned. 
For  the  things  concerning  me  have  an  end. 

But  they  said :  Lord,  behold  here  are  two  swords. 
And  he  said  to  them.  It  is  enough.

JUDAS  the  deceitful  servant,  when  he  stretched  his 
hand  privily  and  took  bread,  did  therewith  take  the 
price  of  him  who  made  man  with  his  own  hands,  thus 
remaining  reprobate. 

Oikos:  Let  us  all  draw  near  in  fear  to  the  mystical 
table,  and  with  pure  souls  receive  the  bread.  Let  us 
stay  with  the  Master  and  behold  how  he  washeth  the 
feet  of  his  Disciples  and  wipeth  them  with  a  towel. 
Let  us  follow  the  example  of  what  we  behold,  submit- 
ting one  to  another,  and  washing  one  another's  feet;  for 
Christ  himself  did  so  command  his  Disciples,  having 
thus  spoken  to  them.  But  Judas,  the  deceitful  and 
treacherous  servant,  heard  not,  and  remained  reprobate.

Synaxarion 

C\^  the  evening  of  this  day,  corresponding  at  that 
^^^  time  to  the  twenty-second  of  the  month  of  March, 
on  the  eve  of  the  Feast  of  Unleavened  Bread,  or  the  eve 
of  the  Mosaic  Passover,  Jesus  ate  the  Supper  in  the 
city  of  Jerusalem  with  his  twelve  Disciples,  and  on  it 
he  blessed  Bread  and  Wine,  thus  instituting  the  Sacra- 
ment of  the  Eucharist.  He  also  washed  the  feet  of  the 
Disciples,  giving  them  a  great  example  of  humility, 
and  said  openly  that  one  of  them  was  about  to  betray 
and  surrender  him.  Then  he  pointed  out  his  betrayer, 
who  was  Judas,  by  giving  him  the  sop  dipped  in  the 
liquid  that  was  in  the  dish.  And  when  Judas  suddenly 
departed,  Jesus  delivered  to  his  Disciples  the  sublime 
last  teachings  contained  in  the  first  of  the  evangical 
chapters  known  as  tht  Passion  Gospels,  and  which  are 
recited  on  the  evening  of  this  day.  After  that,  Jesus 
went  to  the  Mount  of  Olives  and  began  to  sorrow  and 


788  Passion  Week 

grieve.  Then  he  drew  apart  from  the  Disciples,  knelt, 
and  prayed  fervently  till  his  sw^eat  fell  like  drops  of 
blood  on  the  earth.  He  had  not  finished  vs^ith  that 
prayer  and  strife  before  Judas  appeared  w^ith  armed 
soldiers,  and  with  a  great  multitude  of  people.  And 
Judas  greeted  Jesus  the  Master  and  kissed  him  with  a 
false  kiss  and  thus  delivered  him  up. 

And  when  the  soldiers  and  the  servants  of  the  Jews 
had  laid  hands  on  Jesus,  they  bound  him  and  went  with 
him  to  Ananias  and  Caiphas,  the  high  priests,  and  the 
Disciples  were  dispersed,  except  Peter  who  was  more 
zealous  than  the  rest  and  who  followed  him,  with  John, 
to  the  house  of  the  high  priest.  But  Peter  finally  denied 
that  he  was  one  of  his  Disciples.  Then  Jesus  was 
brought  before  the  wicked,  unjust  Council  where  he 
was  examined  and  asked  about  his  Disciples  and  teach- 
ings, and  where  he  was  asked  to  swear  by  God  whether 
he  were  truly  Christ.  And  when  he  explained  the  truth 
he  was  condemned  to  die,  as  though  he  had  deserved 
this  for  blasphemy.  His  face  was  spit  upon,  he  was 
smitten,  and  ridiculed  in  sundry  ways  all  that  night 
until  the  next  morning. 

Wherefore,  by  thine  ineffable  compassion,  O  Christ 
our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us.    Amen. 

7.  The  youths  in  Babylon  despaired  not  because  of 
the  fire  of  the  furnace.  But  when  they  were  cast  into 
the  midst  of  the  flames,  they  were  moistened  with  dew, 
singing,  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  fathers. 

8.  The  blessed  youths  endangered  themselves  in 
Babylon  for  their  fathers'  laws,  refusing  the  ignorant 
and  foolish  commands  of  him  who  considered  himself 
king.  And  being  united  in  the  fire  that  consumed  them 
not,  they  sang  a  seemly  song  to  him  who  helped  them, 
shouting.  Praise  the  Lord,  all  his  works;  exalt  him 
more  and  more  unto  the  ages.

nPHE  Council  of  the  Jews  cometh  together  to  deliver 
to  Pilate  the  Author  and  Creator  of  all.  Woe  to 
their  iniquity  and  infidelity!  For  him  that  cometh  to 
judge  the  living  and  the  dead  they  prepare  for  judg- 
ment; the  Healer  of  sufferings  they  make  ready  for  suf- 
fering, Wherefore,  O  long-suffering  Lord,  great  is  thy 
mercy,  glory  to  thee. 

The  law-transgressing  Judas,  O  Lord,  who  dipped 
his  hand  with  thee  in  the  plate  at  supper,  hath  put  forth 
his  hand  with  iniquity  to  take  silver ;  and  he  who  cal- 
culated the  price  of  the  spice,  did  not  shrink  from  sell- 
ing thee,  O  priceless  One.  And  he  who  put  forth  his 
feet  for  the  Master  to  wash,  deceitfully  kissed  him  to 
deliver  him  to  law-breakers.  Verily,  he  hath  been  cast 
away  with  his  thirty  pieces  of  silver,  without  beholding 
thy  third-day  Resurrection,  through  which,  have  mercy 
upon  us. 

Judas  the  traitor,  being  deceitful,  betrayed  the  Sav- 
iour Lord  with  a  lying  kiss;  and  he  sold  the  Master  of 
all  like  a  slave  to  the  transgressors  of  the  law.  But  the 
Lamb  of  God  followed  like  a  sheep  to  the  slaughter, 
who  is  the  only  Son  of  the  most  merciful  Father. 

Judas,  that  deceitful  and  cunning  slave,  assassinator 
of  the  righteous  One,  hath  been  revealed  through  his 
works;  for  he  followed  the  Master,  and  concealed  with- 
in himself  the  Betrayal.  He  would  say  to  himself,  I 
will  surrender  this  One  and  gain  the  accumulated 
wealth.  He  sought  to  sell  the  spice  and  maliciously 
hold  Jesus.  He  offered  a  kiss  and  surrendered  Christ 
who,  like  a  sheep,  followed  to  slaughter,  who  is  alone 
compassionate  and  the  Lover  of  mankind.

nnODAY  hath  the  wicked  Council  convened  and 
falsely  conspired  against  him,  to  deliver  the  Inno- 
cent to  Pilate  to  die.  Today  Judas  setteth  up  for  him- 
self the  gallows  of  wealth,  and  loseth  both  the  temporal 
and  the  divine  life.  Today  Caiphas  prophesieth  un- 
wittingly, saying.  It  is  better  that  one  die  for  the  people; 
for  he  came  to  suffer  for  our  sins,  that  he  may  deliver 
us  from  the  bondage  of  the  enemy,  since  he  is  good  and 
the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:  He  who  ate  my  bread,  hath  greatly  sup- 
planted me. 

Today  Judas  hath  hidden  the  veil  of  the  love  of  the 
poor,  and  uncovered  the  likeness  of  greed,  not  caring 
for  the  poor.  No  longer  he  selleth  the  spice  of  the  sin- 
ful woman,  but  the  heavenly  Spice,  and  through  it  he 
stealeth  the  silver  and  cometh  to  the  law-transgressing 
Jews  and  saith  to  them.  What  will  you  give  me,  and  I 
will  deliver  him  to  you?  Wherefore,  woe  to  the  trait- 
or's love  of  silver;  for  he  hath  lowered  the  price  of  the 
sale,  and  bargained  over  him  that  is  sold,  after  the  man- 
ner of  traders;  nor  did  he  ask  a  high  price.  Nay,  like 
a  runaway  slave  he  sold  him;  for  it  is  the  custom  of 
robbers  not  to  regard  the  price  of  precious  things;  and 
the  Disciple  cast  holy  things  to  the  dogs;  for  the  rabies 
of  the  love  of  money  hath  made  him  howl  madly 
against  his  Master.  Let  us,  therefore,  flee  this  tempta- 
tion, crying,  O  long-suffering  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

Stichos:    He  went  out  and  spake  to  the  multitude. 

Thy  way,  O  law-breaking  Judas,  is  full  of  deceit; 
for  because  of  thine  infatuation  thou  didst  gain  the  con- 
tempt of  humanity;  for  if  thou  wert  a  lover  of  wealth, 
why  didst  thou  become  a  Disciple  to  him  who  taught

poverty?  And  if  thou  didst  love  the  priceless  One,  why 
didst  thou  sell  and  deliver  him  to  the  violation  of  the 
oppressor?  Wherefore,  O  sun,  dread,  and  O  earth,  sigh 
and  cry  with  trembling.  O  long-suffering  Lord,  glory 
to  thee, 

Stichos:  They  determined  an  unjust  word  against 
me. 

Let  no  one,  O  believers,  remain  uninitiated  in  the 
Lord's  Supper;  let  no  one  at  all  approach  the  table,  like 
Judas,  with  deceit;  for  he  received  a  mouthful,  and 
turned  around  an  assassin  of  the  Bread.  In  appearance, 
verily,  he  was  a  Disciple;  but  in  truth  he  was  a  mur- 
derer. With  the  Jews  he  was  happy,  but  with  the  Dis- 
ciples he  made  his  abode.  He  loved  with  hatred,  and 
with  a  kiss  he  sold  God  who  bought  us  from  the  curse,

Therefore  whosoever  shall  eat  this  bread,  or  drink 
the  chalice  of  the  Lord  unworthily,  shall  be  guilty  of 
the  body  and  of  the  blood  of  the  Lord. 

But  let  a  man  prove  himself:  and  so  let  him  eat  of 
that  bread,  and  drink  of  the  chalice. 

For  he  that  eateth  and  drinketh  unworthily,  eateth 
and  drinketh  judgment  to  himself,  not  discerning  the 
body  of  the  Lord. 

Therefore  are  there  many  infirm  and  weak  among 
you,  and  many  sleep. 

But  if  we  would  judge  ourselves,  we  should  not  be 
judged. 

But  whilst  we  are  judged,  we  are  chastised  by  the 
Lord,  that  we  be  not  condemned  with  this  world.

npHE  Lord  saith  to  his  disciples:  You  know  that 
after  two  days  shall  be  pasch,  and  the  Son  of  man 
shall  be  delivered  up  to  be  crucified: 

Then  were  gathered  together  the  chief  priests  and 
ancients  of  the  people  into  the  court  of  the  high  priest, 
who  was  called  Caiphas: 

And  they  consulted  together,  that  by  subtility  they 
might  apprehend  Jesus,  and  put  him  to  death. 

But  they  said:  Not  on  the  festival  day,  lest  perhaps 
there  should  be  a  tumult  among  the  people. 

And  when  Jesus  was  in  Bethania,  in  the  house  of 
Simon  the  leper. 

There  came  to  him  a  woman  having  an  alabaster  box 
of  precious  ointment,  and  poured  it  on  his  head  as  he 
was  at  table. 

And  the  disciples  seeing  it,  had  indignation,  saying: 
To  what  purpose  is  this  waste? 

For  this  might  have  been  sold  for  much,  and  given 
to  the  poor.

And  Jesus  knowing  it,  said  to  them:  Why  do  you 
trouble  this  woman?  for  she  hath  wrought  a  good  work 
upon  me. 

For  the  poor  you  have  always  with  you :  but  me  you 
have  not  always. 

For  she  in  pouring  this  ointment  upon  my  body,  hath 
done  it  for  my  burial. 

Amen  I  say  to  you,  wheresoever  this  gospel  shall  be 
preached  in  the  whole  world,  that  also  which  she  hath 
done,  shall  be  told  for  a  memory  of  her. 

Then  went  one  of  the  twelve,  who  was  called  Judas 
Iscariot,  to  the  chief  priests. 

And  said  to  them :  What  will  you  give  me,  and  I  will 
deliver  him  unto  you?  But  they  appointed  him  thirty 
pieces  of  silver. 

And  from  thenceforth  he  sought  opportunity  to  be- 
tray him. 

And  on  the  first  day  of  the  Azymes,  the  disciples 
came  to  Jesus,  saying:  Where  wilt  thou  that  we  prepare 
for  thee  to  eat  the  pasch? 

But  Jesus  said :  Go  ye  into  the  city  to  a  certain  man, 
and  say  to  him:  The  master  saith.  My  time  is  near  at 
hand,  with  thee  I  make  the  pasch  with  my  disciples. 

And  the  disciples  did  as  Jesus  appointed  to  them, 
and  they  prepared  the  pasch. 

But  when  it  was  evening,  he  sat  down  with  his  twelve 
disciples. 

Knowing  that  the  Father  had  given  him  all  things 
into  his  hands,  and  that  he  came  from  God,  and  goeth 
to  God; 

He  riseth  from  supper,  and  layeth  aside  his  garments, 
and  having  taken  a  towel,  girded  himself. 

After  that,  he  putteth  water  into  a  basin,  and  began 
to  wash  the  feet  of  the  disciples,  and  to  wipe  them  with 
the  towel  wherewith  he  was  girded. 

He  cometh  therefore  to  Simon  Peter.  And  Peter 
saith  to  him :  Lord,  dost  thou  wash  my  feet? 

Jesus  answered,  and  said  to  him:  What  I  do  thou 
knowest  not  now;  but  thou  shalt  know  hereafter. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  .     795 

Peter  saith  to  him:  Thou  shalt  never  wash  my  feet. 
Jesus  answered  him :  If  I  wash  thee  not,  thou  shalt  have 
no  part  with  me. 

Simon  Peter  saith  to  him:  Lord,  not  only  my  feet, 
but  also  my  hands  and  my  head. 

Jesus  saith  to  him:  He  that  is  washed,  needeth  not 
but  to  wash  his  feet,  but  is  clean  wholly.  And  you  are 
clean,  but  not  all. 

For  he  knew  who  he  was  that  would  betray  him; 
therefore  he  said:  You  are  not  all  clean. 

Then  after  he  had  washed  their  feet,  and  taken  his 
garments,  being  set  down  again,  he  said  to  them :  Know 
you  what  I  have  done  to  you? 

You  call  me  Master,  and  Lord;  and  you  say  well,  for 
so  I  am. 

If  then  I  being  your  Lord  and  Master,  have  washed 
your  feet;  you  also  ought  to  wash  one  another's  feet. 

For  I  have  given  you  an  example,  that  as  I  have  done 
to  you,  so  you  do  also. 

Amen,  amen  I  say  to  you :  The  servant  is  not  greater 
than  his  lord;  neither  is  the  apostle  greater  than  he  that 
sent  him. 

If  you  know  these  things,  you  shall  be  blessed  if  you 
do  them. 

And  whilst  they  were  eating,  he  said :  Amen  I  say  to 
you,  that  one  of  you  is  about  to  betray  me. 

And  they  being  very  much  troubled,  began  every  one 
to  say:  Is  it  I,  Lord? 

But  he  answering,  said:  He  that  dippeth  his  hand 
with  me  in  the  dish,  he  shall  betray  me. 

The  Son  of  man  indeed  goeth,  as  it  is  written  of  him : 
but  woe  to  that  man  by  whom  the  Son  of  man  shall  be 
betrayed :  it  were  better  for  him,  if  that  man  had  not 
been  born. 

And  Judas  that  betrayed  him,  answering,  said :  Is  it  I, 
Rabbi  ?    He  saith  to  him  :  Thou  hast  said  it. 

And  whilst  they  were  at  supper,  Jesus  took  bread, 
and  blessed,  and  broke:  and  gave  to  his  disciples,  and 
said :  Take  ye,  and  eat.    This  is  my  body.

And  taking  the  chalice,  he  gave  thanks,  and  gave  to 
them,  saying:  Drink  ye  all  of  this. 

For  this  is  my  blood  of  the  new  testament,  vv^hich  shall 
be  shed  for  many  unto  remission  of  sins. 

And  I  say  to  you,  I  w^ill  not  drink  from  henceforth 
of  this  fruit  of  the  vine,  until  that  day  when  I  shall 
drink  it  with  you  new  in  the  kingdom  of  my  Father. 

And  a  hymn  said,  they  went  out  unto  mount  Olivet. 

Then  Jesus  saith  to  them:  All  you  shall  be  scandal- 
ized in  me  this  night.  For  it  is  written:  I  will  strike 
the  shepherd,  and  the  sheep  of  the  flock  shall  be  dis- 
persed. 

But  after  I  shall  be  risen  again,  I  will  go  before  you 
into  Galilee. 

And  Peter  answering,  said  to  him :  Although  all  shall 
be  scandalized  in  thee,  I  will  never  be  scandalized. 

Jesus  said  to  him :  Amen  I  say  to  thee,  that  in  this 
night  before  the  cock  crow,  thou  wilt  deny  me  thrice. 

Peter  saith  to  him:  Yea,  though  I  should  die  with 
thee,  I  will  not  deny  thee.  And  in  like  manner  said  all 
the  disciples. 

Then  Jesus  came  with  them  into  a  country  place 
which  is  called  Gethsemani;  and  he  said  to  his  dis- 
ciples: Sit  you  here,  till  I  go  yonder  and  pray. 

And  taking  with  him  Peter  and  the  two  sons  of  Zebe- 
dee,  he  began  to  grow  sorrowful  and  to  be  sad. 

Then  he  saith  to  them:  My  soul  is  sorrowful  even 
unto  death :  stay  you  here,  and  watch  with  me. 

And  going  a  little  further,  he  fell  upon  his  face,  pray- 
ing, and  saying:  My  Father,  if  it  be  possible,  let  this 
chalice  pass  from  me.  Nevertheless  not  as  I  will,  but 
as  thou  wilt. 

And  there  appeared  to  him  an  angel  from  heaven, 
strengthening  him.  And  being  in  an  agony,  he  prayed 
the  longer. 

And  his  sweat  became  as  drops  of  blood,  trickling 
down  upon  the  ground. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  797 

Then  he  ariseth  from  praying  and  cometh  to  his  dis- 
ciples, and  findeth  them  asleep,  and  he  saith  to  Peter: 
What?  Could  you  not  watch  one  hour  with  me? 

Watch  ye,  and  pray  that  ye  enter  not  into  temptation. 
The  spirit  indeed  is  willing,  but  the  flesh  weak. 

Again  the  second  time,  he  went  and  prayed,  saying: 
My  Father,  if  this  chalicd  may  not  pass  away,  but  I 
must  drink  it,  thy  will  be  done. 

And  he  cometh  again,  and  findeth  them  sleeping:  for 
their  eyes  were  heavy. 

And  leaving  them,  he  went  again:  and  he  prayed  the 
third  time,  saying  the  selfsame  word. 

Then  he  cometh  to  his  disciples,  and  saith  to  them: 
Sleep  ye  now  and  take  your  rest;  behold  the  hour  is  at 
hand,  and  the  Son  of  man  shall  be  betrayed  into  the 
hands  of  sinners. 

Rise,  let  us  go:  behold  he  is  at  hand  that  will  betray 
me. 

As  he  yet  spoke,  behold  Judas,  one  of  the  twelve, 
came,  and  with  him  a  ^reat  multitude  with  swords  and 
clubs,  sent  from  the  chief  priests  and  the  ancients  of 
the  people. 

And  he  that  betrayed  him,  gave  them  a  sign,  saying: 
Whomsoever  I  shall  kiss,  that  is  he,  hold  him  fast. 

And  forthwith  coming  to  Jesus,  he  said:  Hail  Rabbi. 
And  he  kissed  him. 

And  Jesus  said  to  him:  Friend,  whereto  art  thou 
come?  Then  they  came  up,  and  laid  hands  on  Jesus, 
and  held  him. 

And  behold  one  of  them  that  were  with  Jesus,  stretch- 
ing forth  his  hand,  drew  out  his  sword:  and  striking 
the  servant  of  the  high  priest,  cut  off  his  ear. 

Then  Jesus  saith  to  him :  Put  up  again  thy  sword  into 
its  place:  for  all  that  take  the  sword  shall  perish  with 
the  sword. 

Thinkest  thou  that  I  cannot  ask  my  Father,  and  he 
will  give  me  presently  more  than  twelve  legions  of 
angels?

How  then  shall  the  scriptures  be  fulfilled,  that  so 
it  must  be  done? 

In  that  same  hour  Jesus  said  to  the  multitudes:  You 
are  come  out  as  it  were  to  a  robber  with  swords  and 
clubs  to  apprehend  me.  I  sat  daily  with  you,  teaching 
in  the  temple,  and  you  laid  not  hands  on  me. 

Now  all  this  was  done,  that  the  scriptures  of  the 
prophets  might  be  fulfilled.  Then  the  disciples  all 
leaving  him,  fled. 

But  they  holding  Jesus  led  him  to  Caiphas  the  high 
priest,  where  the  scribes  and  the  ancients  were  as- 
sembled. 

And  Peter  followed  him  afar  off,  even  to  the  court 
of  the  high  priest.  And  going  in,  he  sat  with  the  serv- 
ants, that  he  might  see  the  end. 

And  the  chief  priests  and  the  whole  council  sought 
false  witness  against  Jesus,  that  they  might  put  him  to 
death : 

And  they  found  not,  whereas  many  false  witnesses 
had  come  in.  And  last  of  all  there  came  two  false 
witnesses : 

And  they  said:  This  man  said,  I  am  able  to  destroy 
the  temple  of  God,  and  after  three  days  to  rebuild  it. 

And  the  high  priest  rising  up,  said  to  him :  Answerest 
thou  nothing  to  the  things  which  these  witness  against 
thee? 

But  Jesus  held  his  peace.  And  the  high  priest  said 
to  him :  I  adjure  thee  by  the  living  God,  that  thou  tell 
us  if  thou  be  the  Christ  the  Son  of  God. 

Jesus  saith  to  him:  Thou  hast  said  it.  Nevertheless 
I  say  to  you,  hereafter  you  shall  see  the  Son  of  man 
sitting  on  the  right  hand  of  the  power  of  God,  and  com- 
ing in  the  clouds  of  heaven. 

Then  the  high  priest  rent  his  garments,  saying:  He 
hath  blasphemed;  what  further  need  have  we  of  wit- 
nesses?   Behold,  now  you  have  heard  the  blasphemy : 

What  think  you?  But  they  answering,  said:  He  is 
guilty  of  death. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  799 

Then  did  they  spit  in  his  face,  and  buffeted  him :  and 
others  struck  his  face  with  the  palms  of  their  hands, 

Saying:  Prophesy  unto  us,  O  Christ,  who  is  he  that 
struck  thee? 

But  Peter  sat  without  in  the  court:  and  there  came  to 
him  a  servant  maid,  saying:  Thou  also  wast  with  Jesus 
the  Galilean. 

But  he  denied  before  them  all,  saying:  I  know  not 
what  thou  sayest. 

And  as  he  went  out  of  the  gate,  another  maid  saw 
him,  and  she  saith  to  them  that  were  there:  This  man 
also  was  with  Jesus  of  Nazareth. 

And  again  he  denied  with  an  oath :  I  know  not  the 
man. 

And  after  a  little  while  they  came  that  stood  by,  and 
said  to  Peter :  Surely  thou  also  art  one  of  them ;  for  even 
thy  speech  doth  discover  thee. 

Then  he  began  to  curse  and  to  swear  that  he  knew 
not  the  man.    And  immediately  the  cock  crew. 

And  Peter  remembered  the  word  of  Jesus  which  he 
had  said:  Before  the  cock  crow,  thou  wilt  deny  me 
thrice.    And  going  forth,  he  wept  bitterly. 

And  when  morning  was  come,  all  the  chief  priests 
and  ancients  of  the  people  took  counsel  against  Jesus, 
that  they  might  put  him  to  death. 

And  they  brought  him  bound,  and  delivered  him  to 
Pontius  Pilate  the  governor.

If  God  be  glorified  in  him,  God  shall  also  glorify  him 
in  himself,  and  shall  straightway  glorify  him. 

Little  children,  yet  a  little  while  I  am  with  you.  Ye 
shall  seek  me;  and  as  I  said  unto  the  Jews,  Whither  I 
go,  ye  cannot  come;  so  now  I  say  to  you. 

A  new  commandment  I  give  unto  you.  That  ye  love 
one  another;  as  I  have  loved  you,  that  ye  also  love  one 
another. 

By  this  shall  all  men  know  that  ye  are  my  disciples, 
if  ye  have  love  one  to  another. 

Simon  Peter  said  unto  him.  Lord,  whither  goest  thou? 

Jesus  answered  him.  Whither  I  go,  thou  canst  not  fol- 
low me  now;  but  thou  shalt  follow  me  afterward. 

Peter  said  unto  him.  Lord,  why  cannot  I  follow  thee 
now?    I  will  lay  down  my  life  for  thy  sake. 

Jesus  answered  him.  Wilt  thou  lay  down  thy  life  for 
my  sake?  Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  thee,  The  cock 
shall  not  crow,  till  thou  hast  denied  me  thrice. 

Let  not  your  heart  be  troubled :  ye  believe  in  God, 
believe  also  in  me.

I 


Great  Holy  Thursday  801 

In  my  Father's  house  are  many  mansions :  if  it  were 
not  so,  I  would  have  told  you.  I  go  to  prepare  a  place 
for  you. 

And  if  I  go  and  prepare  a  place  for  you,  I  will  come 
again,  and  receive  you  unto  myself ;  that  where  I  am, 
there  ye  may  be  also. 

And  whither  I  go  ye  know,  and  the  way  ye  know. 

Thomas  saith  unto  him.  Lord,  we  know  not  whither 
thou  goest;  and  how  can  we  know  the  way? 

Jesus  saith  unto  him,  I  am  the  way,  the  truth,  and 
the  life:  no  man  cometh  unto  the  Father,  but  by  me. 

If  ye  had  known  me,  ye  should  have  known  my 
Father  also:  and  from  henceforth  ye  know  him,  and 
have  seen  him. 

Philip  saith  unto  him.  Lord,  show  us  the  Father,  and 
it  is  enough  for  us. 

Jesus  saith  unto  him.  Have  I  been  so  long  time  with 
you,  and  yet  hast  thou  not  known  me,  Philip?  he  that 
hath  seen  me  hath  seen  the  Father;  and  how  sayest  thou 
then,  Show  us  the  Father? 

Believest  thou  not  that  I  am  in  the  Father,  and  the 
Father  in  me?  the  words  that  I  speak  unto  you  I  speak 
not  of  myself :  but  the  Father  that  dwelleth  in  me,  he 
doeth  the  works. 

Believe  me  that  I  am  in  the  Father,  and  the  Father 
in  me:  or  else  believe  me  for  the  very  works'  sake. 

Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you.  He  that  believeth  on 
me,  the  works  that  I  do  shall  he  do  also;  and  greater 
works  than  these  shall  he  do;  because  I  go  unto  my 
Father. 

And  whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  in  my  name,  that  will 
I  do,  that  the  Father  may  be  glorified  in  the  Son. 

If  ye  shall  ask  any  thing  in  my  name,  I  will  do  it. 

If  ye  love  me,  keep  my  commandments. 

And  I  will  pray  the  Father,  and  he  shall  give  you 
another  Comforter,  that  he  may  abide  with  you  for 
ever; 

Even  the  Spirit  of  truth;  whom  the  world  cannot 
receive,  because  it  seeth  him  not,  neither  knoweth  him: 


802  Passion  Week 

but  ye  know  him;  for  he  dwelleth  with  you,  and  shall 
be  in  you. 

I  will  not  leave  you  comfortless:  I  will  come  to  you. 

Yet  a  little  while,  and  the  world  seeth  me  no  more ; 
but  ye  see  me:  because  I  live,  ye  shall  live  also. 

At  that  day  ye  shall  know  that  I  am  in  my  Father, 
and  ye  in  me,  and  I  in  you. 

He  that  hath  my  commandments,  and  keepeth  them, 
he  it  is  that  loveth  me:  and  he  that  loveth  me  shall  be 
loved  of  my  Father,  and  I  will  love  him,  and  will 
manifest  myself  to  him. 

Judas  saith  unto  him,  not  Iscariot,  Lord,  how  is  it 
that  thou  wilt  manifest  thyself  unto  us,  and  not  unto 
the  world? 

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  him,  If  a  man  love  me, 
he  will  keep  my  words:  and  my  Father  will  love  him, 
and  we  will  come  unto  him,  and  make  our  abode  with 
him.  '-^^r| 

He  that  loveth  me  not  keepeth  not  my  sayings:  and 
the  word  which  ye  hear  is  not  mine,  but  the  Father's 
which  sent  me. 

These  things  have  I  spoken  unto  you,  being  yet  pres- 
ent with  you. 

But  the  Comforter,  which  is  the  Holy  Spirit,  whom 
the  Father  will  send  in  my  name,  he  shall  teach  you  all 
things,  and  bring  all  thines  to  your  remembrance,  what- 
soever I  have  said  unto  you. 

Peace  I  leave  with  you,  my  peace  I  give  unto  you : 
not  as  the  world  giveth,  give  I  unto  you.  Let  not  your 
heart  be  troubled,  neither  let  it  be  afraid. 

Ye  have  heard  how  I  said  unto  you,  I  go  away,  and 
come  again  unto  you.  If  ye  loved  me,  ye  would  rejoice, 
because  I  said,  I  go  unto  the  Father:  for  my  Father  is 
greater  than  I. 

And  now  I  have  told  you  before  it  come  to  pass,  that, 
when  it  is  come  to  pass,  ye  might  believe. 

Hereafter  I  will  not  talk  much  with  you :  for  the 
prince  of  this  world  cometh,  and  hath  nothing  in  me. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  803 

But  that  the  world  may  know  that  I  love  the  Father; 
and  as  the  Father  gave  me  commandment,  even  so  I  do. 
Arise,  let  us  go  hence. 

I  am  the  true  vine,  and  my  Father  is  the  husbandman. 

Every  branch  in  me  that  beareth  not  fruit  he  taketh 
away:  and  every  branch  that  beareth  fruit,  he  purgeth 
it,  that  it  may  bring  forth  more  fruit. 

Now  ye  are  clean  through  the  word  which  I  have 
spoken  unto  you. 

Abide  in  me,  and  I  in  you.  As  the  branch  cannot  bear 
fruit  of  itself,  except  it  abide  in  the  vine;  no  more  can 
ye,  except  ye  abide  in  me. 

I  am  the  vine,  ye  are  the  branches.  He  that  abideth 
in  me,  and  I  in  him,  the  same  bringeth  forth  much  fruit; 
for  without  me  ye  can  do  nothing. 

If  a  man  abide  not  in  me,  he  is  cast  forth  as  a  branch, 
and  is  withered;  and  men  gather  them,  and  cast  them 
into  the  fire,  and  they  are  burned. 

If  ye  abide  in  me,  and  my  words  abide  in  you,  ye  shall 
ask  what  ye  will  and  it  shall  be  done  unto  you. 

Herein  is  my  Father  glorified,  that  ye  bear  much 
fruit;  so  shall  ye  be  my  disciples. 

As  the  Father  hath  loved  me,  so  have  I  loved  you : 
continue  ye  in  my  love. 

If  ye  keep  my  commandments,  ye  shall  abide  in  my 
love;  even  as  I  have  kept  my  Father's  commandments, 
and  abide  in  his  love. 

These  things  have  I  spoken  unto  you,  that  my  joy 
mig:ht  remain  in  you,  and  that  your  joy  might  be  full. 

This  is  my  commandment.  That  ye  love  one  another, 
as  I  have  loved  you. 

Greater  love  hath  no  man  than  this,  that  a  man  lay 
down  his  life  for  his  friends. 

Ye  are  my  friends,  if  ye  do  whatsoever  I  command 
you. 

Henceforth  I  call  you  not  servants;  for  the  servant 
knoweth  not  what  his  lord  doeth :  but  I  have  called  you 
friends;  for  all  things  that  I  have  heard  of  my  Father 
I  have  made  known  unto  you. 


804  Passion  Week 

Ye  have  not  chosen  me,  but  I  have  chosen  you,  and 
ordained  you,  that  ye  should  go  and  bring  forth  fruit, 
and  that  your  fruit  should  remain;  that  whatsoever  ye 
shall  ask  of  the  Father  in  my  name,  he  may  give  it  you. 

These  things  I  command  you,  that  ye  love  one  an- 
other. 

If  the  world  hate  you,  ye  know  that  it  hated  me  before 
it  hated  you. 

If  ye  were  of  the  world,  the  world  would  love  his 
own;  but  because  ye  are  not  of  the  world,  but  I  have 
chosen  you  out  of  the  world,  therefore  the  world  hateth 
you. 

Remember  the  word  that  I  said  unto  you.  The  ser- 
vant is  not  greater  than  his  lord.  If  they  have  perse- 
cuted me,  they  will  also  persecute  you;  if  they  have 
kept  my  saying,  they  will  keep  yours  also. 

But  all  these  things  will  they  do  unto  you  for  my 
name's  sake,  because  they  know  not  him  that  sent  me. 

If  I  had  not  come  and  spoken  unto  them,  they  had 
not  had  sin;  but  now  they  have  no  cloak  for  their  sin. 

He  that  hateth  me,  hateth  my  Father  also. 

If  I  had  not  done  among  them  the  works  which  none 
other  man  did,  they  had  not  had  sin :  but  now  have  they 
both  seen  and  hated  both  me  and  my  Father. 

But  this  cometh  to  pass,  that  the  word  might  be  ful- 
filled that  is  written  in  their  law.  They  hated  me  with- 
out a  cause.  But  when  the  Comforter  is  come,  whom  I 
will  send  unto  you  from  the  Father,  even  the  Spirit  of 
truth,  which  proceedeth  from  the  Father,  he  shall  tes- 
tify of  me: 

And  ye  also  shall  bear  witness,  because  ye  have  been 
with  me  from  the  beginning. 

These  things  have  I  spoken  unto  you,  that  ye  should 
not  be  offended. 

They  shall  put  you  out  of  the  synagogues:  yea,  the 
time  cometh,  that  whosoever  killeth  you  will  think  that 
he  doeth  God  service. 

And  these  things  will  they  do  unto  you,  because  they 
have  not  known  the  Father,  nor  me. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  805 

But  these  things  have  I  told  you,  that  when  the  time 
shall  come,  ye  may  remember  that  I  told  you  of  them. 
And  these  things  I  said  not  unto  you  at  the  beginning, 
because  I  was  with  you. 

But  now  I  go  my  way  to  him  that  sent  me;  and  none 
of  you  asketh  me,  Whither  goest  thou? 

But  because  I  have  said  these  things  unto  you,  sorrow 
hath  filled  your  heart. 

Nevertheless  I  told  you  the  truth;  It  is  expedient  for 
you  that  I  go  away:  for  if  I  go  not  away,  the  Comforter 
will  not^ome  unto  you;  but  if  I  depart,  I  will  send  him 
unto  you. 

And  when  he  is  come,  he  will  reprove  the  world  of 
sin,  and  of  righteousness,  and  of  judgment: 

Of  sin,  becasue  they  believe  not  on  me; 

Of  righteousness,  because  I  go  to  my  Father,  and  ye 
see  me  no  more; 

Of  judgment,  because  the  prince  of  this  world  is 
judged. 

I  have  yet  many  things  to  say  unto  you,  but  ye  cannot 
bear  them  now. 

Howbeit  when  he,  the  Spirit  of  truth,  is  come,  he  will 
guide  you  into  all  truth :  for  he  shall  not  speak  of  him- 
self;  but  whatsoever  he  shall  hear,  that  shall  he  speak: 
and  he  will  show  you  things  to  come. 

He  shall  glorify  me:  for  he  shall  receive  of  mine, 
and  shall  show  it  unto  you. 

All  things  that  the  Father  hath  are  mine:  therefore 
said  I,  that  he  shall  take  of  mine,  and  shall  show  it  unto 
you. 

A  little  while,  and  ye  shall  not  see  me:  and  again,  a 
little  while,  and  ye  shall  see  me,  because  I  go  to  the 
Father. 

Then  said  some  of  his  disciples  among  themselves. 
What  is  this  that  he  saith  unto  us,  A  little  while,  and 
ye  shall  not  see  me:  and  again,  a  little  while,  and  ye 
shall  see  me:  and,  Because  I  go  to  the  Father? 

They  said  therefore.  What  is  this  that  he  saith,  A  little 
while?  we  cannot  tell  what  he  saith. 


806  Passion  Week 

Now  Jesus  knew  that  they  were  desirous  to  ask  him, 
and  said  unto  them,  Do  ye  inquire  among  yourselves  of 
that  I  said,  A  little  while,  and  ye  shall  not  see  me:  and 
again,  a  little  while,  and  ye  shall  see  me? 

Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you.  That  ye  shall  weep  and 
lament,  but  the  world  shall  rejoice;  and  ye  shall  be  sor- 
rowful, but  your  sorrow  shall  be  turned  into  joy. 

A  woman  when  she  is  in  travail  hath  sorrow,  because 
her  hour  is  come:  but  as  soon  as  she  is  delivered  of  the 
child,  she  remembereth  no  more  the  anguish,  for  joy 
that  a  man  is  born  into  the  world.  ^ 

And  ye  now  therefore  have  sorrow :  but  I  will  see  you 
again,  and  your  heart  shall  rejoice,  and  your  joy  no  man 
taketh  from  you. 

And  in  that  day  ye  shall  ask  me  nothing.  Verily,  ver- 
ily, I  say  unto  you,  Whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  the  Father 
in  my  name,  he  will  give  it  you. 

Hitherto  have  ye  asked  nothing  in  my  name :  ask,  and 
ye  shall  receive,  that  your  joy  may  be  full. 

These  things  have  I  spoken  unto  you  in  proverbs: 
but  the  time  cometh,  when  I  shall  no  more  speak  unto 
you  in  proverbs,  but  I  shall  show  you  plainly  of  the 
Father. 

At  that  day  ye  shall  ask  in  my  name :  and  I  say  not 
unto  you,  that  I  will  pray  the  Father  for  you : 

For  the  Father  himself  loveth  you,  because  ye  have 
loved  me,  and  have  believed  that  I  came  out  from  God. 

I  came  forth  from  the  Father,  and  am  come  into  the 
world :  again, I  leave  the  world,  and  go  to  the  Father. 

His  disciples  said  unto  him,  Lo,  now  speakest  thou 
plainly,  and  speakest  no  proverb. 

Now  are  we  sure  that  thou  knowest  all  things,  and 
needest  not  that  any  man  should  ask  thee:  by  this  we 
believe  that  thou  camest  forth  from  God. 

Jesus  answered  them.  Do  ye  now  believe? 

Behold,  the  hour  cometh,  yea,  is  now  come,  that  ye 
shall  be  scattered,  every  man  to  his  own,  and  shall  leave 
me  alone:  and  yet  I  am  not  alone,  because  the  Father  is 
with  me.

These  things  I  have  spoken  unto  you,  that  in  me  ye 
might  have  peace.  In  the  v^orld  ye  shall  have  tribula- 
tion: but  be  of  good  cheer,  I  have  overcome  the  world. 

These  words  spake  Jesus,  and  lifted  up  his  eyes  to 
heaven,  and  said.  Father,  the  hour  is  come;  glorify  thy 
Son,  that  thy  Son  also  may  glorify  thee: 

As  thou  hast  given  him  power  over  all  flesh,  that  he 
should  give  eternal  life  to  as  many  as  thou  hast  given 
him. 

And  this  is  life  eternal,  that  they  might  know  thee 
the  only  true  God,  and  Jesus  Christ,  whom  thou  hast 
sent. 

I  have  glorified  thee  on  the  earth :  I  have  finished  the 
work  which  thou  gavest  me  to  do. 

And  now,  O  Father,  glorify  thou  me  with  thine  own 
self  with  the  glory  which  I  had  with  thee  before  the 
world  was. 

I  have  manifested  thy  name  unto  the  men  which  thou 
gavest  me  out  of  the  world :  thine  they  were,  and  thou 
gavest  them  me;  and  they  have  kept  thy  word. 

Now  they  have  known  that  all  things  whatsoever  thou 
hast  given  me  are  of  thee. 

For  I  have  given  unto  them  the  words  which  thou 
gavest  me;  and  they  have  received  them,  and  have 
known  surely  that  I  came  out  from  thee,  and  they  have 
believed  that  thou  didst  send  me. 

I  pray  for  them:  I  pray  not  for  the  world,  but  for 
them  which  thou  hast  given  me;  for  they  are  thine. 

And  all  mine  are  thine,  and  thine  are  mine;  and  I 
am  glorified  in  them. 

And  now  I  am  no  more  in  the  world,  but  these  are 
in  the  world,  and  I  come  to  thee.  Holy  Father,  keep 
through  thine  own  name  those  whom  thou  hast  given 
me,  that  they  may  be  one,  as  we  are. 

While  I  was  with  them  in  the  world,  I  kept  them  in 
thy  name:  those  that  thou  gavest  me  I  have  kept,  and 
none  of  them  is  lost,  but  the  son  of  perdition;  that  the 
Scripture  might  be  fulfilled.

And  now  come  I  to  thee;  and  these  things  I  speak  in 
the  world,  that  they  might  have  my  joy  fulfilled  in 
themselves. 

I  have  given  them  thy  word;  and  the  world  hath 
hated  them,  because  they  are  not  of  the  world,  even  as 
I  am  not  of  the  world. 

I  pray  not  that  thou  shouldest  take  them  out  of  the 
world,  but  that  thou  shouldest  keep  them  from  the  evil. 

They  are  not  of  the  world,  even  as  I  am  not  of  the 
world. 

Sanctify  them  through  thy  truth:  thy  w^ord  is  truth. 

As  thou  hast  sent  me  into  the  world,  even  so  have  I 
also  sent  them  into  the  world. 

And  for  their  sakes  I  sanctify  myself,  that  they  also 
might  be  sanctified  through  the  truth. 

Neither  pray  I  for  these  alone,  but  for  them  also 
which  shall  believe  on  me  through  their  w^ord; 

That  they  all  may  be  one;  as  thou.  Father,  art  in  me, 
and  I  in  thee,  that  they  also  may  be  one  in  us :  that  the 
world  may  believe  that  thou  hast  sent  me. 

And  the  glory  which  thou  gavest  me  I  have  given 
them;  that  they  may  be  one,  even  as  we  are  one: 

I  in  them,  and  thou  in  me,  that  they  may  be  made 
perfect  in  one;  and  that  the  world  may  know  that  thou 
hast  sent  me,  and  hast  loved  them,  as  thou  hast  loved  me. 

Father,  I  will  that  they  also,  whom  thou  hast  given 
me,  be  wnth  me  where  I  am;  that  they  may  behold  my 
glory,  which  thou  hast  given  me:  for  thou  lovedst  me 
before  the  foundation  of  the  world. 

O  righteous  Father,  the  world  hath  not  known  thee : 
but  I  have  known  thee,  and  these  have  known  that  thou 
hast  sent  me. 

And  I  have  declared  unto  them  thy  name,  and  will 
declare  it;  that  the  love  wherewith  thou  hast  loved  me 
mav  be  in  them,  and  I  in  them. 

When  Jesus  had  spoken  these  words,  he  went  forth 
with  his  discinles  over  the  brook  Cedron,  where  was  a 
garden,  into  the  which  he  entered,  and  his  disciples.

First  Antiphony,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

I  '  I  ''HE  rulers  of  the  nations  took  counsel  against  the 
Lord  and  against  his  Anointed. 
Words  contrary  to  the  law  they  contrived  against  me. 
I  Wherefore,  Lord,  O  Lord,  forsake  me  not. 

Let  us  direct  our  senses  undefiled  towards  Christ; 
and  as  his  lovers  let  us  sacrifice  ourselves  for  him,  nor 
be  choked,  like  Judas,  with  worldly  anxieties.  Let  us, 
contrariwise,  cry  in  our  chambers,  O  Father  who  art 
in  heaven,  deliver  us  from  evil. 

Glory  and  Now:  Thou,  who  knewest  not  wedlock, 
hast  given  birth  while  still  a  Virgin,  and  didst  remain  a 
Virgin.  Wherefore,  O  Mary,  the  Theotokos,  the 
Mother  without  groom,  beseech  Christ  our  God  to 
save  us. 

Second  Antiphony,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

nnOWARDS  the  law-transgressing  Scribes  Judas 
hastened,  saying.  What  will  you  give  me,  and  I  will 
deliver  him  to  you.  Invisibly  thou  hast  stood,  O  Christ, 
among  the  conspirators,  being  plotted  against.  Where- 
fore, thou  who  knowest  the  contents  of  our  hearts,  have 
pity  on  our  souls. 

Let  us  serve  the  Lord  with  mercy,  like  Mary  at  Sup- 
per. And  let  us  not  be  possessed  of  the  love  of  silver, 
like  Judas;  that  we  may  be  always  with  Christ. 

Glory  and  Now:  Cease  not,  O  Virgin,  to  implore 
him  whom  thou  didst  bear  ineffably,  that  he  may  save 
from  tribulations  those  who  take  refuge  in  thee;  for  he 
is  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Third  Antiphony,  in  the  Second  Tone 

nPHE  Hebrew  youths,  O  Lord,  for  the  resurrection 
of  Lazarus,  hailed  thee,  saying,  Hosanna,  O  Lover 
of  mankind!   But  law-breaking  Judas  refused  to  under- 
stand.

Thou  didst  foretell  it  at  thy  Supper,  O  Christ  God, 
and  saidst  to  thy  Disciples,  Verily,  one  of  you  shall  be- 
tray me.  But  law-breaking  Judas  refused  to  under- 
stand. 

When  John  asked  thee,  O  Lord,  who  shall  betray 
thee,  thou  didst  point  him  out  to  him  by  means  of  the 
bread.  But  the  law-breaking  Judas  refused  to  under- 
stand. 

The  Jews  sought  thy  death  with  thirty  pieces  of  sil- 
ver and  a  kiss  of  deceit.  But  the  law-breaking  Judas 
refused  to  understand. 

At  the  washing  of  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ  God,  thou 
didst  urge  them  saying,  As  ye  have  seen,  so  do  ye.  But 
the  law-breaking  Judas  refused  to  understand. 

Thou  didst  tell  thy  Disciples,  O  God,  Watch  and 
pray,  lest  ye  be  tempted.  But  the  law-breaking  Judas 
refused  to  understand. 

Glory  and  Now:  Deliver  thy  servants  from  tribula- 
tion, O  Theotokos;  for  we  all,  after  God,  seek  refuge 
in  thee,  since  thou  art  an  impregnable  fortress  and  an 
intercessor. 

Kathisma,  in  the  Seventh  Tone 

\X/^HEN  thou  didst  help  thy  Disciples  at  the  Supper 
and  knewest  the  intent  to  betray,  thou  didst  re- 
proach Judas  for  it,  knowing  the  while  that  he  was 
incorrigible;  but  preferring  to  make  all  know  that  thou 
wast  betrayed  of  thine  own  will,  that  thou  mightest 
snatch  the  world  from  the  stranger.  Wherefore,  O 
long-suffering  One,  glory  be  to  thee. 

The  Second  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (18:1-28) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  went  forth  with  his  disciples 
over  the  brook  Cedron,  where  was  a  garden  into 
the  which  he  entered,  and  his  disciples. 

And  Judas  also,  which  betrayed  him,  knew  the  place: 
for  Jesus  ofttimes  resorted  thither  with  his  disciples. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  811 

Judas  then,  having  received  a  band  of  men  and  of- 
ficers from  the  chief  priests  and  Pharisees,  cometh 
thither  with  lanterns  and  torches  and  weapons. 

Jesus  therefore,  knowing  all  things  that  should  come 
upon  him,  went  forth,  and  said  unto  them.  Whom  seek 
ye? 

They  answered  him,  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  Jesus  saith 
unto  them,  I  am  he.  And  Judas  also,  which  betrayed 
him,  stood  with  them. 

As  soon  then  as  he  had  said  unto  them,  I  am  he,  they 
went  backward,  and  fell  to  the  ground. 

Then  asked  he  them  again.  Whom  seek  ye?  And 
they  said,  Jesus  of  Nazareth. 

Jesus  answered,  I  have  told  you  that  I  am  he:  if 
therefore  ye  seek  me,  let  these  go  their. way: 

That  the  saying  might  be  fulfilled,  which  he  spake, 
Of  them  which  thou  gavest  me  have  I  lost  none. 

Then  Simon  Peter  having  a  sword  drew  it,  and  smote 
the  high  priest's  servant,  and  cut  ofif  his  right  ear.  The 
servant's  name  was  Malchus. 

Then  said  Jesus  unto  Peter,  Put  up  thy  sword  into 
the  sheath :  the  cup  which  my  Father  hath  given  me, 
shall  I  not  drink  it? 

Then  the  band  and  the  captain  and  officers  of  the 
Jews  took  Jesus,  and  bound  him, 

And  led  him  away  to  Annas  first;  for  he  was  father- 
in-law  to  Caiaphas,  which  was  the  high  priest  that 
same  year. 

Now  Caiaphas  was  he,  which  gave  counsel  to  the 
Jews,  that  it  was  expedient  that  one  man  should  die 
for  the  people. 

And  Simon  Peter  followed  Jesus,  and  so  did  another 
disciple:  that  disciple  was  known  unto  the  high  priest, 
and  went  in  with  Jesus  into  the  palace  of  the  high  priest. 

But  Peter  stood  at  the  door  without.  Then  went  out 
that  other  disciple,  which  was  known  unto  the  high 
priest,  and  spake  unto  her  that  kept  the  door,  and 
brought  in  Peter.

Then  saith  the  damsel  that  kept  the  daar  unto  Peter, 
Art  not  thou  also  one  of  this  man's  disciples?  He  saith, 
I  am  not. 

And  the  servants  and  officers  stood  there,  who  had 
made  a  fire  of  coals,  for  it  was  cold;  and  they  warmed 
themselves:  and  Peter  stood  with  them,  and  warmed 
himself. 

The  high  priest  then  asked  Jesus  of  his  disciples,  and 
of  his  doctrine. 

Jesus  answered  him,  I  spake  openly  to  the  world;  I 
ever  taught  in  the  synagogue,  and  in  the  temple,  whither 
the  Jews  always  resort;  and  in  secret  have  I  said 
nothing. 

Why  askest  thou  me?  ask  them  which  heard  me,  what 
I  have  said  unto  them :  behold,  they  know  what  I  said. 

And  when  he  had  thus  spoken,  one  of  the  officers 
which  stood  by  struck  Jesus  with  the  palm  of  his  hand, 
saying,  Answerest  thou  the  high  priest  so? 

Jesus  answered  him,  If  I  have  spoken  evil,  bear  wit- 
ness of  the  evil :  but  if  well,  why  smitest  thou  me? 

Now  Annas  had  sent  him  bound  unto  Caiphas  the 
high  priest. 

And  Simon  Peter  stood  and  warmed  himself.  They 
said  therefore  unto  him.  Art  not  thou  also  one  of  his 
disciples?    He  denied  it,  and  said,  I  am  not. 

One  of  the  servants  of  the  high  priest,  being  his  kins- 
man whose  ear  Peter  cut  ofif,  saith,  Did  not  I  see  thee 
in  the  garden  with  him? 

Peter  then  denied  again;  and  immediately  the  cock 
crew. 

Then  led  they  Jesus  from  Caiphas  unto  the  hall  of 
judgment:  and  it  was  early;  and  they  themselves  went 
not  into  the  judgment  hall,  lest  they  should  be  defiled; 
but  that  they  might  eat  the  passover.

Great  Holy  Thursday  813 

for  how  can  he  see  who  sold  the  Star  for  thirty  pieces  of 
silver.  But  he  who  suffered  for  our  sake  hath  shone 
forth  upon  us.  Wherefore,  let  us  hail  him,  saying,  O 
thou  who  didst  suffer  in  pity  for  mankind,  glory  be 
to  thee. 

Today  doth  Judas  adulterate  the  worship  of  God, 
and  becometh  estranged  from  the  Gift.  He  was  a  Dis- 
ciple, and  became  a  betrayer.  He  covered  deceit  with 
the  semblance  of  friendship,  and  preferred  thirty  pieces 
of  silver  to  the  love  of  the  Master,  becoming  a  guide 
to  the  Council  of  law-transgressors.  But  having  Christ 
as  our  Salvation,  let  us  glorify  him. 

O  brethren,  let  us  take  possession  of  brotherly  love, 
as  brethren  of  Christ,  not  mercilessness  towards  our 
neighbours,  lest  we  be  condemned  as  that  merciless  serv- 
ant for  the  sake  of  money;  nor  repent,  like  Judas,  when 
such  repentance  availeth  us  not. 

Glory  and  Now:  Glorious  things  have  been  spoken 
of  thee  every^vhere,  O  Mary,  Theotokos,  who  didst  give

with  a  deceitful  kiss  he  delivered  him  to  those  who  are 
without  law  to  kill  him. 

Today  the  Creator  of  heaven  and  earth  said  to  his

trayer approacheth.  Wherefore,  let  no  one  deny  me 
when  he  seeth  me  on  the  Cross  between  two  thieves;  for 
as  Man  I  shall  suffer  and  save  those  who  believe  in  me; 
for  I  am  the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Glory  and  Now:  O  thou  who,  in  the  last  days,  didst 
conceive  ineffably,  and  didst  give  birth  to  thy  Creator, 
save,  O  Virgin,  those  who  magnify  thee.

T'^ODAY  Judas  watcheth  the  night  to  deliver  the 
eternal  Lord,  the  Saviour  of  the  World,  who  satis- 
fied the  multitudes  with  five  loaves.  Today  that  law- 
less one  denieth  his  Master.  A  Disciple  he  was,  yet 
delivered  the  Master,  selling  for  silver  him  who  fed 
man  with  manna. 

Today  the  Jews  nail  on  the  Cross  him  who  did  cleave 
the  sea  with  a  rod,  and  made  them  to  pass  through  the 
wilderness.  Today  they  pierce  with  a  spear  the  side  of 
him  who  scourged  Egypt  with  curses  for  their  sake; 
and  will  give  him  bitterness  to  drink  who  rained  down 
manna  for  their  nourishment. 

When  thou  camest  to  thy  suffering,  willingly,  O 
Lord,  thou  didst  cry  out  to  thy  Disciples :  If  ye  cannot 
watch  with  me  one  hour,  why  then  promised  ye  that 
ye  would  die  for  me?  Rather  see  ye  how  Judas  sleeo- 
eth  not,  but  hasteneth  to  deliver  me  to  those  who  dis- 
obey the  law.  Arise  and  pray,  and  let  no  one  deny  me 
when  he  seeth  me  on  the  Cross.  Wherefore,  O  long- 
sufifering  One,  glory  be  to  thee. 

Glory  and  Now:  Rejoice,  O  Theotokos,  who  didst 
hold  in  thy  womb  him  whom  the  heavens  hold  not. 
Rejoice,  O  Virgin,  whom  the  Prophets  preached,  from 
whom  Immanuel  shone  forth  upon  us.  Rejoice,  O 
Mother  of  Christ  God. 

Kathisma,  in  the  Seventh  Tone 

Vt/^HAT  caused  thee,  O  Judas,  to  betray  the  Saviour? 
Did  he  set  thee  aside  from  the  Disciples?  Did 
he  deny  thee  the  gift  of  healing?  Did  he  take  supper 
with  the  others  and  send  thee  away  from  the  table? 
Did  he  wash  the  feet  of  the  rest  and  pass  thee  by?  Of 
how  much  goodness  hast  thou  become  forgetful?  Yea, 
thine  unpraiseworthy  mind  hath  been  exposed.  But

Great  Holy  Thursday  815 

The  Third  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (26:57  to  end) 
AT  that  time:  The  soldiers  had  laid  hold  on  Jesus 
^^^  and  led  him  away  to  Caiphas  the  high  priest,  where 
the  Scribes  and  the  elders  were  assembled. 

But  Peter  followed  him  afar  off  unto  the  high  priest's 
palace,  and  went  in,  and  sat  with  the  servants,  to  see 
the  end. 

Now  the  chief  priests,  and  elders  and  all  the  council, 
sought  false  witness  against  Jesus,  to  put  him  to  death; 

But  found  none:  yea,  though  many  false  witnesses 
came,  yet  found  they  none.  At  the  last  came  two  false 
witnesses. 

And  said.  This  fellow  said,  I  am  able  to  destroy  the 
temple  of  God,  and  to  build  it  in  three  days. 

And  the  high  priest  arose,  and  said  unto  him,  An- 
swerest  thou  nothing?  what  is  it  which  these  witness 
against  thee? 

But  Jesus  held  his  peace.  And  the  high  priest  an- 
swered and  said  unto  him,  I  adjure  thee  by  the  living 
God,  that  thou  tell  us  whether  thou  be  the  Christ,  the 
Son  of  God. 

Jesus  saith  unto  him,  Thou  hast  said :  nevertheless  I 
say  unto  you.  Hereafter  shall  ye  see  the  Son  of  man 
sitting  on  the  right  hand  of  power,  and  coming  in  the 
clouds  of  heaven. 

Then  the  high  priest  rent  his  clothes,  saying.  He  hath 
spoken  blasphemy;  what  further  need  have  we  of  wit- 
nesses? behold,  now  ye  have  heard  his  blasphemy. 

What  think  ye?  They  answered  and  said.  He  is  guilty 
of  death. 

Then  did  they  spit  in  his  face,  and  bufifeted  him;  and 
others  smote  him  with  the  palms  of  their  hands, 

Saying,  Prophesy  unto  us,  thou  Christ,  Who  is  he 
that  smote  thee? 

Now  Peter  sat  without  in  the  palace:  and  a  damsel 
came  unto  him,  saying,  Thou  also  wast  with  Jesus  of 
Galilee. 

But  he  denied  before  them  all,  saying,  I  know  not 
what  thou  sayest.

And  when  he  was  gone  out  into  the  porch,  another 
maid  saw  him,  and  said  unto  them  that  were  there,  This 
fellow  was  also  with  Jesus  of  Nazareth. 

And  again  he  denied  with  an  oath,  I  do  not  know  the 
man. 

And  after  a  while  came  unto  him  they  that  stood  by, 
and  said  to  Peter,  Surely  thou  also  art  one  of  them;  for 
thy  speech  betrayeth  thee. 

Then  began  he  to  curse  and  to  swear,  saying,  I  know 
not  the  man.    And  immediately  the  cock  crew. 

And  Peter  remembered  the  word  of  Jesus,  which  said 
unto  him,  Before  the  cock  crow,  thou  shalt  deny  me 
thrice.    And  he  went  out,  and  wept  bitterly. 

Seventh  Antiphony,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

T\/TTH  patience  and  forbearance  thou  didst  cry  out, 
O  Lord,  to  the  law-violators  who  laid  hold  upon 
thee,  saying.  If  ye  have  stricken  the  Shepherd  and  dis- 
persed my  Disciples,  those  twelve  sheep,  I  am  able  to 
bring  more  than  twelve  ranks  of  angels.  But  suffer  ye 
long  that  that  may  be  fulfilled  which  I  have  revealed  to 
you  through  my  Prophets  of  mysteries  and  hidden 
things.    Wherefore,  Lord,  glory  be  to  thee. 

Three  times  did  Peter  deny.  And  perceiving  im- 
mediately what  was  told  him,  he  offered  thee  tears  of 
repentance,  saying,  God_,  forgive  me  and  save  me.

CAY  ye,  O  transgressors  of  the  law,  what  heard  ye 
from  our  Saviour?  Is  it  not  that  he  appointed  a  law 
and  the  teachings  of  the  Prophets?  How  then  did  ye 
think  to  deliver  to  Pilate  the  Word,  God  of  God,  and 
the  Deliverer  of  our  souls. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  817 

They  who  benefited  always  by  thy  gifts,  O  Christ, 
were  crying,  Let  him  be  crucified.  And  the  killers  of 
the  righteous  sought  to  free  an  evil-doer  in  place  of  "the 
Benefactor.  But  thou  wast  silent,  enduring  their  arro- 
gance, wishing  to  suffer  and  to  save  us,  since  thou  art 
the  Lover  of  mankind. 

Glory  and  Now:  For  verily,  we  have  no  favour,  for 
the  multitude  of  our  sins.  Therefore,  O  virgin  Theo- 
tokos,  plead  with  him  who  was  born  of  thee;  for  the 
pleadings  of  the  Mother  are  greatly  effective  in  win- 
ning the  favour  of  the  Master.  Turn  thou  not  away 
therefore,  from  the  pleadings  of  sinners,  O  most  vener- 
able; for  he  who  was  willing  to  suffer  for  our  sins  is 
merciful  and  able  to  save  us.

"\/ERILY,  they  set  the  thirty  pieces  of  silver,  the

enter  into  temptation;  for  the  spirit  is  ready,  but  the 
flesh  is  weak.    Wherefore,  watch  ye. 

They  gave  me  gall  in  my  meat;  and  in  my  thirst  they 
gave  me  vinegar  to  drink.  But  thou,  O  Lord,  raise  me, 
that  I  may  reward  them. 

Glory  and  Now:  We  who  are  of  the  Gentiles  praise 
thee,  O  undefiled  Theotokos;  for  thou  didst  bear  Christ 
our  God,  who  through  thee  delivered  mankind  from 
the  curse.

He  supped  with  thee  in  deceit,  that  unrighteous  assas- 
sin; then  went  to  the  priests,  saying.  What  will  ye  give 
me  to  deliver  unto  you  him  who  loosed  the  law  and 
profaned  the  sabbath?  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  glory  be  to 
thy  long-suffering. 


818  Passion  Week 

The  Fourth  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (18:28  to  end; 
19:1-16) 

AT  that  time:  They  led  Jesus  from  Caiphas  to  the 
governor's  hall.  And  it  was  morning;  and  they 
went  not  into  the  hall,  that  they  might  not  be  defiled, 
but  that  they  might  eat  the  pasch. 

Pilate  then  went  out  unto  them,  and  said,  What  accu- 
sation bring  ye  against  this  man? 

They  answered  and  said  unto  him,  If  he  were  not  a 
malefactor,  we  would  not  have  delivered  him  up  unto 
thee. 

Then  said  Pilate  unto  them.  Take  ye  him,  and  judge 
him  according  to  your  law.  The  Jews  therefore  said 
unto  him.  It  is  not  lawful  for  us  to  put  any  man  to 
death  : 

That  the  saying  of  Jesus  might  be  fulfilled,  which  he 
spake,  signifying  what  death  he  should  die. 

Then  Pilate  entered  into  the  judgment  hall  again, 
and  called  Jesus,  and  said  unto  him.  Art  thou  the  King 
of  the  Jews? 

Jesus  answered  him,  Sayest  thou  this  thing  of  thy- 
self, or  did  others  tell  it  thee  of  me? 

Pilate  answered.  Am  I  a  Jew?  Thine  own  nation 
and  the  chief  priests  have  delivered  thee  unto  me :  what 
hast  thou  done? 

Jesus  answered.  My  kingdom  is  not  of  this  world:  if 
my  kingdom  were  of  this  world,  then  would  my  serv- 
ants fight,  that  I  should  not  be  delivered  to  the  Jews : 
but  now  is  my  kingdom  not  from  hence. 

Pilate  therefore  said  unto  him.  Art  thou  a  king  then? 
Jesus  answered,  Thou  sayest  that  I  am  a  king.  To 
this  end  was  I  born,  and  for  this  cause  came  I  into  the 
world,  that  I  should  bear  witness  unto  the  truth.  Every 
one  that  is  of  the  truth  heareth  my  voice. 

Pilate  saith  unto  him.  What  is  truth?  And  when  he 
had  said  this,  he  went  out  again  unto  the  Jews,  and  saith 
unto  them,  I  find  in  him  no  fault  at  all. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  819 

But  ye  have  a  custom,  that  I  should  release  unto  you 
one  at  the  passover:  will  ye  therefore  that  I  release  unto 
you  the  King  of  the  Jews? 

Then  cried  they  all  again,  saying,  Not  this  man,  but 
Barabbas.    Now  Barabbas  was  a  robber. 

Then  Pilate  therefore  took  Jesus,  and  scourged  him. 

And  the  soldiers  platted  a  crown  of  thorns,  and  put 
it  on  his  head,  and  they  put  on  him  a  purple  robe, 

And  said.  Hail,  King  of  the  Jews!  and  they  smote 
him  with  their  hands. 

Pilate  therefore  went  forth  again,  and  saith  unto 
them.  Behold,  I  bring  him  forth  to  you,  that  ye  may 
know  that  I  find  no  fault  in  him. 

Then  came  Jesus  forth,  wearing  the  crown  of  thorns, 
and  the  purple  robe.  And  Pilate  saith  unto  them.  Be- 
hold the  man! 

When  the  chief  priests  therefore  and  officers  saw 
him,  they  cried  out,  saying,  Crucify  him,  crucify  him. 
Pilate  saith  unto  them,  Take  ye  him,  and  crucify  him: 
for  I  find  no  fault  in  him. 

The  Jews  answered  him.  We  have  a  law,  and  by  our 
law  he  ought  to  die,  because  he  made  himself  the  Son 
of  God. 

When  Pilate  therefore  heard  that  saying,  he  was  the 
more  afraid; 

And  went  again  into  the  judgment  hall,  and  saith 
unto  Jesus,  Whence  art  thou?  But  Jesus  gave  him  no 
answer. 

Then  saith  Pilate  unto  him,  Speakest  thou  not  unto 
me?  knowest  thou  not  that  I  have  power  to  crucify 
thee,  and  have  power  to  release  thee? 

Jesus  answered,  Thou  couldest  have  no  power  at  all 
against  me,  except  it  were  given  thee  from  above :  there- 
fore he  that  delivered  me  unto  thee  hath  the  greater  sin. 

And  from  thenceforth  Pilate  sought  to  release  him: 
but  the  Jews  cried  out.  sayine.  Tf  thou  let  this  man  go, 
thou  art  not  Caesar's  friend :  whosoever  maketh  himself 
a  king  speaketh  against  Caesar. 


820  Passion<  Week 

When  Pilate  therefore  heard  that  saying,  he  brought 
Jesus  forth,  and  sat  down  in  the  judgment  seat  in  a 
place  that  is  called  the  Pavement,  but  in  the  Hebrew, 
Gabbatha. 

And  it  was  the  preparation  of  the  passover,  and  about 
the  sixth  hour:  and  he  saith  unto  the  Jews,  Behold  your 
King! 

But  they  cried  out.  Away  with  him,  away  with  him, 
crucify  him.  Pilate  saith  unto  them.  Shall  I  crucify 
your  King?  The  chief  priests  answered.  We  have  no 
kins:  but  Caesar. 

Then  delivered  he  him  therefore  unto  them  to  be 
crucified.

Verily,  the  Disciple  denied,  like  an  ingrate;  and  the

heads,  heaping  upon  thee  ridicule  and  reproach.  But 
thou,  O  Lord,  reward  them  according  to  their  deeds; 
for  they  ridiculed  thee  falsely. 

Neither  the  earth  in  its  quaking,  the  rocks  when  they

O  my  people,  what  have  I  done  unto  thee,  and  where- 
with hast  thou  rewarded  me?  Instead  of  manna,  gall; 
and  in  place  of  water,  vinegar;  and  instead  of  loving 
me,  thou  didst  nail  me  to  the  Cross.  I  can  endure  no 
more.  I  will  call  the  Gentiles,  and  they  shall  glorify 
me  with  the  Father,  and  the  Spirit.  And  I  will  grant 
them  everlasting  life.

Ye  Jews  and  Pharisees  who  lay  down  the  law  for 
Israel,  verily,  the  assembly  of  the  Disciples  cry  out  to 
you.  Behold  the  Temple  which  ye  destroyed!  Behold 
the  Lamb  whom  ye  crucified!  Ye  delivered  him  to  the 
grave,  but  he  arose  by  his  own  power.  Do  not  err,  O 
Jews ;  for  it  is  he  who  saved  you  in  the  sea  and  nourished

Wherefore,  O  long-suffering  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

The  Fifth  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (27:3-32) 

/\  T  that  time:  Judas,  which  had  betrayed  him,  when 
he  saw  that  he  was  condemned,  relented  himself, 
and  brought  again  the  thirty  pieces  of  silver  to  the  chief 
priests  and  elders. 

Saying,  I  have  sinned  in  that  I  have  betrayed  the 
innocent  blood.  And  they  said.  What  is  that  to  us? 
see  thou  to  that. 

And  he  cast  down  the  pieces  of  silver  in  the  temple, 
and  departed,  and  went  and  hanged  himself. 

And  the  chief  priests  took  the  silver  pieces,  and  said, 
It  is  not  lawful  for  to  put  them  into  the  treasury,  be- 
cause it  is  the  price  of  blood. 

And  they  took  counsel,  and  bought  with  them  the 
potter's  field,  to  bury  strangers  in. 

Wherefore  that  field  was  called,  the  field  of  blood, 
unto  this  day. 

Then  was  fulfilled  that  which  was  spoken  by  Jeremy 
the  prophet,  saying,  And  they  took  the  thirty  pieces  of 
silver,  the  price  of  him  that  was  valued,  whom  they  of 
the  children  of  Israel  did  value; 

And  gave  them  for  the  potter's  field,  as  the  Lord 
appointed  me. 

And  Jesus  stood  before  the  governor :  and  the  gover-

And  Jesus  said  unto  him.  Thou  sayest.

And  when  he  was  accused  of  the  chief  priests  and 
elders,  he  answered  nothing. 

Then  said  Pilate  unto  him,  Hearest  thou  not  how 
many  things  they  witness  against  thee? 

And  he  answered  him  to  never  a  ward;  insomuch, 
that  the  governor  marveled  greatly; 

Now  at  that  feast  the  governor  was  wont  to-  release- 
unto  the  people  a  prisoner,  whom  they  would. 

And  they  had  then  a  notable  prisoner,  called  Bar- 
abbas. 

Therefore  when  they  were  gathered  together,  Pilate 
said  unto  them,  Whom  will  ye  that  I  release  unto  you? 
Barabbas,  or  Jesus  which  is  called  Christ? 

For  he  knew  that  for  envy  they  had  delivered  him. 

When  he  was  set  down  on  the  judgment  seat,  his  wife 
sent  unto  him,  saying,  Have  thou  nothing  to  do  with 
that  just  man:  for  I  have  suffered  many  things  this  day 
in  a  dream  because  of  him. 

But  the  chief  priests  and  elders  persuaded  the  multi- 
tude that  they  should  ask  Barabbas,  and  destroy  Jesus. 

The  governor  answered  and  said  unto  them,  Whether 
of  the  twain  will  ye  that  I  release  unto  you?  They  said, 
Barabbas. 

Pilate  saith  unto  them.  What  shall  I  do  then  with 
Jesus  which  is  called  Christ?  They  all  say  unto  him, 
Let  him  be  crucified. 

And  the  governor  said,  Why,  what  evil  hath  he  done? 
But  they  cried  out  the  more,  saying.  Let  him  be  cruci- 
fied. 

When  Pilate  saw  that  he  could  prevail  nothing,  but 
that  rather  a  tumult  was  made,  he  took  water,  and 
washed  his  hands  before  the  multitude,  saying,  I  am 
innocent  of  the  blood  of  this  just  person:  see  ye  to  it. 

Then  answered  all  the  people,  and  said,  His  blood 
be  on  us,  and  on  our  children. 

Then  released  he  Barabbas  unto  them:  and  when  he 
had  scourged  Jesus,  he  delivered  him  to  be  crucified.

Then  the  soldiers  of  the  governor  took  Jesus  into  the 
common  hall,  and  gathered  unto  him  the  whole  band  of 
soldiers. 

And  they  stripped  him,  and  put  on  him  a  scarlet  robe. 

And  when  they  had  platted  a  crown  of  thorns,  they 
put  it  upon  his  head,  and  a  reed  in  his  right  hand:  and 
they  bowed  the  knee  before  him,  and  mocked  him,  say- 
ing, Hail,  King  of  the  Jews! 

And  they  spit  upon  him,  and  took  the  reed,  and  smote 
him  on  the  head. 

And  after  that  they  had  mocked  him,  they  took  the 
robe  off  from  him,  and  put  his  own  raiment  on  him,  and 
led  him  away  to  crucify  him. 

And  as  they  came  out,  they  found  a  man  of  Cyrene, 
Simon  by  name:  him  they  compelled  to  bear  his  cross.

1  It  has  been  the  custom,  since  the  middle  of  the  past  century,  in  Greek 
churches,  and  particularlyi  Syrian,  for  the  Arch'priest  to  carry  the  crucifix, 
and,  after  circling  the  holy  Altar,  to  come  out  through  the  left  door,  and  to 
carry  it  in  procession  in  the  church,  as  he  sings.  Today  is  suspended  on  a 
Tree,  etc.,  in  the  intonation  of  the  Gospel  reading.  Then  he  plants  the  cruci'

A  T  that  time :  The  soldiers  led  Jesus  away  into  the 
^^^  hall,  called  Praetorium;  and  they  call  together  the

And  they  clothed  him  with  purple,  and  platted  a

And  when  they  had  mocked  him,  they  took  off  the 
purple  from  him,  and  put  his  own  clothes  on  him,  and

And  when  they  had  crucified  him,  they  parted  his

should  take.

And  it  was  the  third  hour,  and  they  crucified  him. 

And  the  superscription  of  his  accusation  was  written 
over,  The  King  of  the  Jews. 

And  with  him  they  crucify  two  thieves;  the  one  on 
his  right  hand,  and  the  other  on  his  left. 

And  the  Scripture  was  fulfilled,  which  saith,  And  he 
was  numbered  with  the  transgressors. 

And  they  that  passed  by  railed  on  him,  wagging  their 
heads,  and  saying.  Ah,  thou  that  destroyest  the  temple, 
and  buildest  it  in  three  days. 

Save  thyself,  and  come  down  from  the  cross. 

Likewise  also  the  chief  priests  mocking  said  among 
themselves  with  the  scribes,  He  saved  others;  himself 
he  cannot  save. 

Let  Christ  the  King  of  Israel  descend  now  from  the 
cross,  that  we  may  see  and  believe. 

^Then  sing  the  Makarizmoi,  on  Eight  Stichoi,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

In  thy  kingdom,  remember  us,  O  Lord,  when  thou 
comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit;  for  theirs  is  the  king- 
dom of  heaven. 

Blessed  are  they  that  mourn;  for  they  shall  be  com- 
forted. 

Blessed  are  the  meek;  for  they  shall  inherit  the  earth. 

T)  ECAUSE  of  a  tree,  Adam  was  estranged  from  par- 
^  adise;  and  the  thief  because  of  the  tree  of  the  Cross 
abode  in  paradise;  for  the  former  in  tasting,  disobeyed 
the  commandment  of  the  Creator;  but  the  latter,  who 
was  crucified  with  thee,  confessed,  admitting  to  thee 
that  thou  art  a  hidden  God.  Wherefore,  O  Saviour, 
remember  him  and  us  in  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  they  that  hunger  and  thirst  after  right- 
eousness; for  they  shall  be  filled. 

The  law-transgressors  verily  did  buy  the  Ordainer 
of  the  law  from  a  Disciple.  And  as  a  law-breaker 
they  brought  him  before  Pilate,  crying  out  that  he  who

gave  them  manna  in  the  wilderness  be  crucified.  But 
we,  emulating  the  righteous  thief,  cry  out  in  faith, 
Remember  him  and  us,  O  Saviour,  in  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  merciful;  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy. 

The  assembly  of  the  Jews,  that  wicked,  God-attack- 
ing nation,  madly  cried  to  Pilate,  saying.  Crucify  Christ 
the  innocent;  pleading  that  Barabbas  be  rather  released. 
But  we  cry  in  the  voice  of  the  grateful  thief.  Remember 
him  and  us,  O  Saviour,  in  thy  kingdom. 

Blessed  are  the  pure  in  heart;  for  they  shall  see  God. 

Thy  life-bearing  side,  O  Christ,  overfloweth  like  a 
spring  from  Eden,  watering  thy  Church  as  a  paradise 
endowed  with  speech;  and  thence  divideth  the  glad  tid- 
ings into  four  Gospels,  as  into  four  heads,  watering  the 
world,  gladdening  creation,  and  teaching  the  Gentiles  to 
adore  thy  kingdom  in  faith. 

Blessed  are  the  peacemakers;  for  they  shall  be  called 
the  children  of  God. 

Thou  wast  crucified,  O  Christ,  for  my  sake,  that  thou 
mightest  pour  forth  salvation  for  me.  And  thy  side 
was  pierced  with  a  spear,  that  it  might  cause  rivers  of 
life  to  flow  for  me.  Thou  wast  fastened  with  the  nails; 
and  so  realizing  the  depth  of  thy  Passion  and  the  height 
of  thy  might,  I  will  cry  unto  thee.  Glory  to  thy  Passion 
and  to  thy  Crucifixion,  O  life-giving  Saviour. 

Blessed  are  they  which  are  persecuted  for  righteous- 
ness' sake;  for  theirs  is  the  kingdom  of  heaven. 

The  whole  creation,  O  Christ,  beholding  thy  Cruci- 
fixion, trembled;  the  foundations  of  the  earth  were 
shaken  for  dread  of  thy  might;  the  two  luminaries  went 
into  hiding;  the  veil  of  the  Temple  was  rent;  the  moun- 
tains quaked ;  and  the  rocks  burst  asunder,  as  the  be- 
lieving thief  cried  with  us  unto  thee.  Saviour,  remem- 
ber me. 

Blessed  are  ye  when  men  shall  revile  you,  and  perse- 
cute you,  and  say  all  manner  of  evil  against  you  falsely 
for  my  sake. 

Thou  hast  torn  with  the  spear,  O  Lord,  the  hand- 
writing of  ordinances  that  were  against  us,  and  thou 


Great  Holy  Thursday  829 

wast  numbered  among  the  dead,  binding  there  the 
usurper,  and  delivering  all  from  the  bonds  of  death  by 
thy  Resurrection,  by  which  we  have  been  enlightened. 
Wherefore,  we  cry  to  thee,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  to 
remember  us  in  thy  kingdom. 

Rejoice  and  be  glad,  for  great  is  your  reward  in 
heaven. 

O  Lord,  who  wast  elevated  on  the  Cross,  and  who, 
being  God,  loosed  the  bonds  of  death  and  blotted  out 
the  handwriting  of  ordinances  against  us,  grant  us  and 
the  thief  his  repentance,  O  thou  who  art  alone  the  Lover 
of  mankind,  us  who  worship  thee  in  faith,  O  Christ  our 
God,  and  who  cry  to  thee,  Remember  him  and  us  in  thy 
kin2:dom. 

Glory :  Come,  all  ye  believers,  let  us  with  one  mind 
beseech,  glorifying  as  is  meet,  the  Father,  Son,  and 
Holy  Spirit,  the  one  Godhead  in  three  Persons,  perma- 
nent without  confusion,  simple,  indivisible,  and  un- 
approachable, through  whom  we  escape  the  fire  of 
punishment. 

Now:  We  offer  thee  for  intercession,  O  most  merci- 
ful Christ  Lord,  thv  Mother,  the  true  Virgin,  who  with- 
out seed,  gave  thee  birth  in  the  body  and  remained  with- 
out corruption  after  her  birth-giving,  that  thou  might-

constantly.  Remember  him  and  us,  O  Saviour,  in  thy 
kingdom.

They  parted  my  garments  among  them,  and  upon 
my  vesture  did  they  cast  lots.  My  God,  my  God,  be- 
hold, why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 

The  Seventh  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (27:3354) 

A  T  that  time  :  The  soldiers  brought  Jesus  unto  a  place 
^  ^  called  Golgotha,  that  is  to  say,  a  place  of  a  skull. 
They  gave  him  vinegar  to  drink  mingled  with  gall: 
and  when  he  had  tasted  thereof,  he  would  not  drink. 


830  Passion  Week 

And  they  crucified  him,  and  parted  his  garments, 
casting  lots :  that  it  might  be  fulfilled  which  was  spoken 
by  the  prophet.  They  parted  my  garments  among  them, 
and  upon  my  vesture  did  they  cast  lots. 

And  sitting  down  they  watched  him  there; 

And  set  up  over  his  head  his  accusation  written,  This 
is  Jesus  the  King  of  the  Jews. 

Then  were  there  two  thieves  crucified  with  him ;  one 
on  the  right  hand,  and  another  on  the  left. 

And  they  that  passed  by  reviled  him,  wagging  their 
heads. 

And  saying,  Thou  that  destroyest  the  temple,  and 
buildest  it  in  three  days,  save  thyself.  If  thou  be  the 
Son  of  God,  come  down  from  the  cross. 

Likewise  also  the  chief  priests  mocking  him,  with 
the  scribes  and  elders,  said. 

He  saved  others;  himself  he  cannot  save.  If  he  be 
the  King  of  Israel,  let  him  now  come  down  from  the 
cross,  and  we  will  believe  him. 

He  trusted  in  God;  let  him  deliver  him  now,  if  he 
will  have  him:  for  he  said,  I  am  the  Son  of  God. 

The  thieves  also,  which  were  crucified  with  him,  cast 
the  same  in  his  teeth. 

Now  from  the  sixth  hour  there  was  darkness  over  all 
the  land  unto  the  ninth  hour. 

And  about  the  ninth  hour  Jesus  cried  with  a  loud 
voice,  saying,  Eli,  Eli,  lamasabachthani?  that  is  to  say. 
My  God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 

Some  of  them  that  stood  there,  when  they  heard  that, 
said,  This  man  calleth  for  Elias. 

And  straightway  one  of  them  ran,  and  took  a  sponge, 
and  filled  it  with  vinegar,  and  put  it  on  a  reed,  and  gave 
him  to  drink. 

The  rest  said.  Let  be,  let  us  see  whether  Elias  will 
come  to  save  him. 

Jesus,  when  he  had  cried  again  with  a  loud  voice, 
yielded  up  the  ghost. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  831 

And,  behold,  the  veil  of  the  temple  was  rent  in  twain 
from  top  to  the  bottom;  and  the  earth  did  quake,  and 
the  rocks  rent; 

And  the  graves  were  opened ;  and  many  bodies  of  the 
saints  which  slept  arose, 

And  came  out  of  the  graves  after  his  resurrection, 
and  went  into  the  holy  city,  and  appeared  unto  many. 

Now  when  the  centurion,  and  they  that  were  with 
him,  watching  Jesus,  saw  the  earthquake,  and  those 
things  that  were  done,  they  feared  greatly,  saying.  Truly 
this  was  the  Son  of  God. 

^Then  read  Psalm  50  {p.  82) ;  and  immediately : 

The  Eighth  Gospel:  from  St,  Luke  (23:32-49) 

\  T  that  time :  There  were  also  two  other,  malef  a.c- 
tors,  led  with  him  to  be  put  to  death. 

And  when  they  were  come  to  the  place,  which  is 
called  Calvary,  there  they  crucified  him,  and  the  male- 
factors, one  on  the  right  hand,  and  the  other  on  the  left. 

Then  said  Jesus,  Father,  forgive  them;  for  they  know 
not  what  they  do.  And  they  parted  his  raiment,  and  cast 
lots. 

And  the  people  stood  beholding.  And  the  rulers  also 
with  them  derided  him,  saying,  He  saved  others;  let  him 
save  himself,  if  he  be  Christ,  the  chosen  of  God. 

And  the  soldiers  also  mocked  him,  coming  to  him, 
and  offering  him  vinegar, 

And  saying,  If  thou  be  the  King  of  the  Jews,  save  thy- 
self. 

And  a  superscription  also  was  written  over  him  in 
letters  of  Greek,  and  Latin,  and  Hebrew,  This  is  the 
King  of  the  Jews. 

And  one  of  the  malefactors  which  were  hanged  railed 
on  him,  saying,  If  thou  be  the  Christ,  save  thyself  and 
us. 

But  the  other  answering  rebuked  him,  saying,  Dost 
not  thou  fear  God,  seeing  thou  art  in  the  same  condem- 
nation?

And  we  indeed  justly;  for  we  receive  the  due  reward 
of  our  deeds:  but  this  man  hath  done  nothing  amiss. 

And  he  said  unto  Jesus,  Lord,  remember  me  when 
thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 

And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Verily  I  say  unto  thee,  To- 
day shalt  thou  be  with  me  in  paradise. 

And  it  was  about  the  sixth  hour,  and  there  was  a  dark- 
ness over  all  the  earth  until  the  ninth  hour. 

And  the  sun  was  darkened,  and  the  veil  of  the  temple 
was  rent  in  the  midst. 

And  when  Jesus  had  cried  with  a  loud  voice,  he  said. 
Father,  into  thy  hands  I  commend  my  spirit:  and  hav- 
ing said  thus,  he  gave  up  the  ghost. 

Now  when  the  centurion  saw  what  was  done,  he  glori- 
fied God,  saying,  Certainly  this  was  a  righteous  man. 

And  all  the  people  that  came  together  to  that  sight, 
beholding  the  things  which  were  done,  smote  their 
breasts,  and  returned. 

And  all  his  acquaintance,  and  the  women  that  fol- 
lowed him  from  Galilee,  stood  afar  off,  beholding  these 
things.

'  I  ^HE  thief  hath  opened  the  closed  gates  of  Eden  by 
a  sign  from  thy  might. 
When  using  as 'a  key  this  saying,   Remember  me, 
Lord,  in  thy  kingdom. 

At  the  dawn  of  day  on  a  Friday  that  fell  on  the 
twenty-third  of  March,  Jesus,  bound  by  Caiphas,  was 
sent  to  Pontius  Pilate,  the  governor  of  Judaea,  who 
investigated  him  carefully.  And  finding  no  fault  with 
him  he  twice  confessed  his  innocence.  Nevertheless,  he 
condemned  him  to  death  to  please  the  Jews.  And  the 
Lord  of  all,  having  been  scourged,  like  a  runaway  slave, 
was  delivered  to  be  crucified.  The  soldiers  then  took 
him,  stripped  him  and  put  on  a  scarlet  robe.  They  put 
on  his  head  a  crown  of  thorns,  and  in  his  right  hand  a 
reed  instead  of  a  sceptre.  And  they  began  to  kneel  be- 
fore him  mockingly,  and  spat  upon  him,  and  smote  him, 
and  struck  him  on  the  head.  Then  they  put  on  him  his 
clothes,  made  him  carry  the  Cross  and  took  him  to  Gol- 
gotha, the  place  for  the  execution  of  his  sentence,  and 
there  they  crucified  him,  about  the  third  hour  of  the  day, 
between  two  thieves.  Those  who  passed  by  blasphemed 
against  him,  and  the  high  priests  mocked  him.  Then 
the  soldiers  gave  him  to  drink  vinegar  mixed  with 
wormwood.  And  in  the  ninth  hour  Jesus,  the  Lamb  of 
God,  who  took  away  the  sins  of  the  world  (St.  Jn.  1 :29) , 
cried  with  a  loud  voice.  It  is  finished,  and  gave  up  the 
ghost,  at  the  very  hour  in  which  the  Lamb  of  the  Mo- 
saic Passover  was  being  slaughtered,  which  the  Jews 
had  been  commanded  to  sacrifice  every  year  as  a  symbol 
of  him  1642  years  previously.  The  moon  on  that  night 
was  full  (Ex.  12). 

And  when  mute  creation  looked  upon  the  Master's 
Death  it  grieved,  trembling  and  fearful.  Then  after  the 
Maker  of  all  creation  p^ave  up  the  ghost  his  side  was 
pierced,  and  from  it  flowed  blood  and  water.  Then 
Joseph  of  Arimathea  came  at  the  setting  of  the  sun,  and 
with  him  was  Nicodemus,  both  of  whom  were  secretly

Cross,  wound  it  with  linens  and  spices  and  laid  him  in 
a  new  sepulchre,  and  over  its  door  they  rolled  a  great 
stone. 

In  memory,  therefore,  of  this  fearful  redemptive  Pas- 
sion of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  we  celebrate  today;  and 
at  that  time  it  was  delivered  to  us  by  an  apostolic  com-

Eighth  Ode 

TPHE  divine  youths  exposed  the  God-contending  pil- 
lar of  wickedness;  and  the  assembly  of  the  wicked, 
roaring  at  Christ,  conspired  falsely,  studying  how  to 
kill  him  who  holdeth  life  in  his  grasp,  whom  all  crea- 
tion doth  bless,  glorifying  me  unto  all  ages. 

Thou  didst  say  to  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ,  Drive  away 
sleep  from  your  eyelids;  watch  in  prayer  lest  ye  fall; 
and  especially  thou,  Simon;  for  the  haughty  sufifereth 
greater  trial.  Know  thou  me,  O  Peter,  whom  all  crea- 
tion doth  bless,  glorifying  me  unto  all  ages. 

Verily,  Peter  cried,  saying.  No  evil  words,  O  Master, 
shall  come  out  of  my  lips,  but,  as  one  of  true  loyalty,  I 
will  die  with  thee,  even  though  all  deny  thee;  for  flesh 
and  blood  hath  not  revealed  thee  unto  me,  but  the 
Father  whom  all  creation  blesseth,  glorifying  him  unto 
all  ages. 

And  the  Lord  said,  Thou  dost  not  comprehend,  O 
man,  the  depth  of  the  divine  wisdom  and  knowledge; 
thou  hast  not  fathomed  my  decrees;  for  since  thou  art 
flesh,  vaunt  not  boastfully;  for  thou  shalt  deny  me 
thrice,  whom  all  creation  doth  bless,  glorifying  unto  all 
ages. 

O  Simon  Peter,  said  the  Lord,  Thou  shalt  presently 
deny  what  thou  hast  been  convinced  of,  as  it  hath  been 
said;  for  a  maiden  shall  suddenly  appear  and  frighten

thee.  Then  thou  shalt  weep  bitterly,  but  thou  shalt  find 
nie  forgiving,  whom  all  creation  doth  bless,  glorifying 
unto  all  ages. 

Ninth  Ode 

f^  THOU  who  art  more  honourable  than  the  cher- 
ubim, and  beyond  compare  more  glorious  than  the 
seraphim,  who  without  corruption  didst  bear  the  Word 
of  God;  truly,  thou  art  the  Theotokos,  and  thee  do  we 
magnify. 

The  corrupting  soldiers,  despised  of  God,  and  the 
band  of  God-killing  wicked  hastened  to  thee,  O  Christ, 
and  led  thee  away  as  an  unrighteous  one,  thou  Creator 
of  all  whom  we  magnify. 

The  impious,  for  their  ignorance  of  the  law  and  their 
false  study  of  the  sayings  of  the  Prophets,  have  unjust- 
ly led  thee  like  a  sheep  to  slaughter,  O  Lord  of  all, 
whom  we  magnify. 

The  priests  with  the  scribes,  wounded  by  the  evil  of 
their  utter  envy,  delivered  Life  to  the  Gentiles  to  be 
killed;  thee,  O  natural  Source  of  life,  whom  we  mag- 
nify. 

They  have  surrounded  thee  like  many  dogs,  O  King, 
and  smitten  thee  on  the  cheeks,  questioning  thee  and 
bearing  false  witness  against  thee ;  and  thou  hast  borne  it 
all,  delivering  all. 

Exaposteilarion,  in  the  Third  Tone  (three  times) 

Thou  made  the  thief  worthy  of  paradise  on  the  same 
day,  O  Lord.  Wherefore,  illuminate  me  too  by  the 
tree  of  thy  Cross  and  save  me. 

The  Ninth  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (19:25-37) 

AT  that  time:  There  stood  by  the  Cross  of  Jesus  his 
mother  and  his  mother's  sister  Mary  the  wife  of 
Cleophas,  and  Mary  Magdalene. 


Great  Holy  Thursday  8.^7 

When  Jesus  therefore  saw  his  mother,  and  the  dis- 
ciple standing  hy,  whom  he  loved,  he  saith  unto  his  mo- 
ther. Woman,  hehold  thy  son! 

Then  saith  he  to  the  disciple,  Behold  thy  mother! 
And  from  that  hour  that  disciple  took  her  unto  his  own 
home. 

After  this,  Jesus  knowing  that  all  things  were  now 
accomplished,  that  the  Scripture  might  be  fulfilled, 
saith,  I  thirst. 

Now  there  was  set  a  vessel  full  of  vinegar:  and  they 
filled  a  sponge  with  vinegar,  and  put  it  upon  hyssop,  and 
put  it  to  his  mouth. 

When  Jesus  therefore  had  received  the  vinegar,  he 
said,  It  is  finished:  and  he  bowed  his  head,  and  gave  up 
the  ghost. 

The  Jews  therefore,  because  it  was  the  preparation, 
that  the  bodies  should  not  remain  upon  the  cr6ss  on  the 
sabbath  day,  (for  that  sabbath  day  was  a  high  day,)  be- 
sought Pilate  that  their  legs  might  be  broken,  and  that 
they  might  be  taken  away. 

Then  came  the  soldiers,  and  brake  the  legs  of  the 
first,  and  of  the  other  which  was  crucified  with  him. 

But  when  they  came  to  Jesus,  and  saw  that  he  was 
dead  already,  they  brake  not  his  legs: 

But  one  of  the  soldiers  with  a  spear  pierced  his  side, 
and  forthwith  came  there  out  blood  and  water. 

And  he  that  saw  it  bare  record,  and  his  record  is  true; 
and  he  knoweth  that  he  saith  true,  that  ye  might  believe. 

For  these  things  were  done,  that  the  Scripture  should 
be  fulfilled,  A  bone  of  him  shall  not  be  broken. 

And  again  another  Scripture  saith.  They  shall  look 
on  him  whom  they  pierced.

And  thou,,  O  Israel,  refrained  not,  but  delivered  me

Every  merhber  of  thy  holy  body,  O  Saviour,  hath 
endured  humiliation  for  our  sakes;  the  head  with 
thorns,  the  face  with  spitting,  the  cheeks  with  blows, 
the  mouth  with  the  taste  of  vinegar  mixed  with  gall, 
the  ears  with  blasphemies  replete  with  infidelity,  the

from  suffering,  condescending  to  us  for  thy  love  of  man-

us. 

The  whole  creation,  O  Christ,  beholding  thee  cruci- 
fied, trembled;  and  the  foundations  of  the  earth  shook 
for  dread  of  thy  might;  for  by  thine  elevation  today 
the  Hebrew  race  perished,  and  the  veil  of  the  Temple 
was  rent  in  twain,  the  graves  were  opened,  and  the  dead 
rose  from  their  tombs,  as  the  centurion,  beholding  this 
miracle,  was  frightened.  As  for  thy  Mother,  she  stood 
by  wailing  and  moaning  as  mothers  do,  saying.  How 
shall  I  not  wail,  and  smite  my  breast  as  I  see  thee  naked 
and  elevated  on  a  Tree,  as  one  condemned?  Wherefore,

counsellors  who  were  also  awaiting  the  kingdom 
of  God,  came,  and  went  in  boldly  unto  Pilate,  and 
craved  the  body  of  Jesus. 

And  Pilate  marvelled  if  he  were  already  dead:  and 
calling  unto  him  the  centurion,  he  asked  him  whether 
he  had  been  any  while  dead. 

And  when  he  knew  it  of  the  centurion,  he  gave  the 
body  to  Joseph. 

And  he  bought  fine  linen,  and  took  him  down,  and 
wrapped  him  in  the  linen,  and  laid  him  in  a  sepulchre 
which  was  hewn  out  of  a  rock,  and  rolled  a  stone  unto

besought  Pilate  that  he  might  take  away  the  body  of 
Jesus.    And  Pilate  gave  him  leave.    He  came  therefore, 
and  took  the  body  of  Jesus!

And  there  came  also  Nicodcmus,  which  at  the  first 
came  to  Jesus  by  night,  and  brought  a  mixture  of  myrrli 
and  aloes,  about  a  hundred  pound  weight. 

Then  took  they  the  body  of  Jesus,  and  wound  it  in 
linen  clothes  with  the  spices,  as  the  manner  of  the  Jews 
is  to  bury. 

Now  in  the  place  where  he  was  crucified  there  was  a 
garden:  and  in  the  garden  a  new  sepulchre,  wherein 
was  never  man  yet  laid. 

There  laid  they  Jesus  therefore  because  of  the  Jews'

0  my  God,  I  shall  cry  by  day,  and  thou  wilt  not  hear : 
and  by  night,  and  it  shall  not  be  reputed  as  folly  in  me. 

But  thou  dwellest  in  the  holy  place,  the  praise  of 
Israel. 

In  thee  have  our  fathers  hoped  :  they  have  hoped,  and 
thou  hast  delivered  them. 

They  cried  to  thee,  and  they  were  saved :  they  trusted 
in  thee,  and  were  not  confounded. 

But  I  am  a  worm,  and  no  man:  the  reproach  of  men, 
and  the  outcast  of  the  people. 

All  they  that  saw  me  have  laughed  me  to  scorn :  they 
have  spoken  with  the  lips,  and  wagged  the  head. 

He  hoped  in  the  Lord,  let  him  deliver  him:  let  him 
save  him  seeing  he  delighteth  in  him. 

For  thou  art  he  that  hast  drawn  me  out  of  the  womb : 
my  hope  from  the  breasts  of  my  mother.  I  was  cast 
upon  thee  from  the  womb. 

From  my  mother's  womb  thou  art  my  God,  depart  not 
from  me. 

For  tribulation  is  very  near:  for  there  is  none  to  help

For  many  dogs  have  encompassed  me:  the  council  of 
the  malignant  hath  besieged  me. 

They  have  dug  my  hands  and  feet.  They  have  num-

And  they  have  looked  and  stared  upon  me.  They 
parted  my  garments  amongst  them:  and  upon  my  ves-

Ye  that  fear  the  Lord,  praise  him:  all  ye  the  seed  of 
Jacob,  glorify  him. 

Let  all  the  seed  of  Israel  fear  him:  because  he  hath 
not  slighted  nor  despised  the  supplication  of  the  poor 
man. 

Neither  hath  he  turned  away  his  face  from  me:  and 
when  I  cried  to  him  he  heard  me. 

With  thee  is  my  praise  in  a  great  church :  I  will  pay 
my  vows  in  the  sight  of  them  that  fear  him. 

The  poor  shall  eat  and  shall  be  filled :  and  they  shall 
praise  the  Lord  that  seek  him:  their  hearts  shall  live 
for  ever  and  ever. 

All  the  ends  of  the  earth  shall  remember,  and  shall 
be  converted  to  the  Lord : 

And  all  the  kindreds  of  the  Gentiles  shall  adore  in  his 
sight. 

For  the  kingdom  is  the  Lord's;  and  he  shall  have 
dominion  over  the  nations. 

All  the  fat  ones  of  the  earth  have  eaten  and  have 
adored:  all  they  that  go  down  to  the  earth  shall  fall  be- 
fore him. 

And  to  him  my  soul  shall  live:  and  my  seed  shall 
serve  him. 

There  shall  be  declared  to  the  Lord  a  generation  to 
come:  and  the  heavens  shall  shew  forth  his  justice  to  a

world. 

For  in  Christ  Jesus  neither  circumcision  availeth  any 
thing,  nor  uncircumcision,  but  a  new  creature. 

And  whosoever  shall  follow  this  rule,  peace  on  them,

A  T  that  time :  When  morning  was  come,  all  the  chief 
priests  and  ancients  of  the  people  took  counsel 
against  Jesus,  that  they  might  put  him  to  death. 

And  they  brought  him  bound,  and  delivered  him  to 
Pontius  Pilate  the  governor. 

Then  Judas,  who  betrayed  him,  seeing  that  he  was 
condemned,  repenting  himself,  brought  back  the  thirty 
pieces  of  silver  to  the  chief  priests  and  ancients,  saying: 
I  have  sinned  in  betraying  innocent  blood.  But  they 
said :  What  is  that  to  us?  Look  thou  to  it. 

And  casting  down  the  pieces  of  silver  in  the  temple, 
he  departed :  and  went  and  hanged  himself  with  an 
halter. 

But  the  chief  priest  having  taken  the  pieces  of  silver, 
said:  It  is  not  lawful  to  put  them  into  the  corbona,  be- 
cause it  is  the  price  of  blood.

And  after  they  had  consulted  together,  they  bought 
with  them  the  potter's  field,  to  be  a  burying  place  for 
strangers. 

For  this  cause  that  field  was  called  Haceldama,  that 
is,  the  field  of  blood,  even  to  this  day. 

Then  was  fulfilled  that  which  was  spoken  byjeremias 
the  prophet,  saying:  And  they  took  the  thirty  pieces  of 
silver,  the  price  of  him  that  was  valued,  whom  they 
prized  of  the  children  of  Israel. 

And  they  gave  them  unto  the  potter's  field,  as  the 
Lord  appointed  to  me. 

And  Jesus  stood  before  the  governor,  and  the  govern- 
or asked  him,  saying:  Art  thou  the  king  of  the  Jews? 
Jesus  saith  to  him  :  Thou  sayest  it. 

And  when  he  was  accused  by  the  chief  priests  and 
ancients,  he  answered    nothing. 

Then  Pilate  saith  to  him:  Dost  not  thou  hear  how 
great  testimonies  they  allege  against  thee? 

And  he  answered  him  to  never  a  word;  so  that  the 
governor  wondered  exceedingly. 

Now  upon  the  solemn  day  the  governor  was  accus- 
tomed to  release  to  the  people  one  prisoner,  whom  they 
would. 

And  he  had  then  a  notorious  prisoner,  that  was  called 
Barabbas. 

They  therefore  being  gathered  together,  Pilate  said : 
Whom  will  you  that  I  release  to  you,  Barabbas,  or  Jesus 
that  is  called  Christ? 

For  he  knew  that  for  envy  they  had  delivered  him. 

And  as  he  was  sitting  in  the  place  of  judgment,  his 
wife  sent  to  him,  saving:  Have  thou  nothing  to  do  with 
that  just  man;  for  I  have  suffered  many  things  this  day 
in  a  dream  because  of  him. 

But  the  chief  priests  and  ancients  persuaded  the 
people,  that  they  should  ask  Barabbas,  and  take  Jesus 
away. 

And  the  governor  answering,  said  to  them:  Whether 
will  you  of  the  two  to  be  released  unto  you?  But  they 
said,  Barabbas.

Pilate  saith  to  them :  What  shall  I  do  then  with  Jesus

The  governor  said  to  them :  Why,  what  evil  hath  he 
done?  But  they  cried  out  the  more,  saying:  Let  him  be 
crucified. 

And  Pilate  seeing  that  he  prevailed  nothing,  but  that 
rather  a  tumult  was  made;  taking  water  washed  his 
hands  before  the  people,  saying:  I  am  innocent  of  the 
blood  of  this  just  man;  look  you  to  it. 

And  the  whole  people  answering,  said:  His  blood 
be  upon  us  and  upon  our  children. 

Then  he  released  to  them  Barabbas,  and  having 
scourged  Jesus,  delivered  him  unto  them  to  be  cruci- 
fied. 

Then  the  soldiers  of  the  governor  taking  Jesus  into 
the  hall,  gathered  together  unto  him  the  whole  band ; 

And  stripping  him,  they  put  a  scarlet  cloak  about 
him. 

And  platting  a  crown  of  thorns,  they  put  it  upon  his 
head,  and  a  reed  in  his  right  hand.  And  bowing  the 
knee  before  him,  they  mocked  him,  saying:  Hail  king 
of  the  Jews. 

And  spitting  upon  him,  they  took  the  reed,  and  struck 
his  head. 

And  after  they  had  mocked  him,  they  took  ofi  the 
cloak  from  him,  and  put  on  him  his  own  garments,  and 
led  him  away  to  crucify  him. 

And  going  out,  they  found  a  man  of  Cyrene,  named 
Simon:  him  they  forced  to  take  up  his  cross. 

And  they  came  to  the  place  that  is  called  Golgotha, 
which  is  the  place  of  Calvary. 

And  they  gave  him  wine  to  drink  mingled  with  gall. 
And  when  he  had  tasted,  he  would  not  drink. 
And  after  they  had  crucified  him.  they  divided  his 
garments,  casting  lots;  that  it  might  be  fulfilled  which 
was  spoken  by  the  prophet,  saying:  They  divided  mv 
garments  among  them;  and  upon  my  vesture  they  cast 
lots. 

And  they  sat  and  watched  him. 


Good  Friday  Morning  849 

And  they  put  over  his  head  his  cause  written:  This 
is  Jesus  the  King  of  the  Jews. 

Then  were  crucified  with  him  two  thieves:  one  on 
the  right  hand,  and  one  on  the  left. 

And  they  that  passed  by,  blasphemed  him,  wagging 
their  heads. 

And  saying:  Vah,  thou  that  destroyest  the  temple  of 
God,  and  in  three  days  dost  rebuild  it:  save  thy  own 
self:  if  thou  be  the  Son  of  God,  come  down  from  the 
cross. 

In  like  manner  also  the  chief  priests,  with  the  scribes 
and  ancients,  mocking,  said  : 

He  saved  others;  himself  he  cannot  save.  If  he  be  the 
king  of  Israel,  let  him  now  come  down  from  the  cross, 
and  we  will  believe  him. 

He  trusted  in  God ;  let  him  now  deliver  him  if  he  will 
have  him;  for  he  said:  I  am  the  Son  of  God. 

And  the  selfsame  thing  the  thieves  also,  that  were 
crucified  with  him,  reproached  him  with. 

Now  from  the  sixth  hour  there  was  darkness  over  the 
whole  earth,  until  the  ninth  hour. 

And  about  the  ninth  hour  Jesus  cried  with  a  loud 
voice,  saying:  Eli,  Eli,  lamma  sabacthani?  that  is.  My 
God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 

And  some  that  stood  there  and  heard,  said :  This  man 
calleth  Elias. 

And  immediately  one  of  them  running  took  a  sponge, 
and  filled  it  with  vinegar ;  and  put  it  on  a  reed,  and  gave 
him  to  drink. 

And  the  others  said:  Let  be,  let  us  see  whether  Elias 
will  come  to  deliver  him. 

And  Jesus  again  crying  with  a  loud  voice,  yielded  up 
the  ghost. 

And  behold  the  veil  of  the  temple  was  rent  in  two 
from  the  top  even  to  the  bottom,  and  the  earth  quaked, 
and  the  rocks  were  rent. 

And  the  graves  were  opened :  and  many  bodies  of  the 
saints  that  had  slept  arose,

And  coming  out  of  the  tombs  after  his  resurrection, 
came  into  the  holy  city,  and  appeared  to  many. 

Now  the  centurion  and  they  that  were  with  him 
watching  Jesus,  having  seen  the  earthquake,  and  the 
things  that  were  done,  were  sore  afraid,  saying:  Indeed 
this  was  the  Son  of  God. 

And  there  were  there  many  women  afar  off,  who  had 
followed  Jesus  from  Galilee,  ministering  unto  him : 

Among  whom  was  Mary  Magdalen,  and  Mary  the 
mother  of  James  and  Joseph,  and  the  mother  of  the 
sons  of  Zebedee.

C^Jfter  O  come,  let  us  worship,  etc.  (three  times),  the  following 
Psalms. 

Psalm  34 

JUDGE  thou,  O  Lord,  them  that  wrong  me:  over- 
throw them  that  fight  against  me. 
Take  hold  of  arms  and  shield:  and  rise  up  to  help 
me. 

Bring  out  the  sword,  and  shut  up  the  way  against 
them  that  persecute  me :  say  to  my  soul :  I  am  thy  salva- 
tion. 

Let  them  be  confounded  and  ashamed  that  seek  after 
my  soul. 


Good  Friday  Morning  851 

Let  them  be  turned  back  and  be  confounded  that  de- 
vise evil  against  me. 

Let  them  become  as  dust  before  the  wind:  and  let 
the  angel  of  the  Lord  straiten  them. 

Let  their  way  become  dark  and  slippery;  and  let  the 
angel  of  the  Lord  pursue  them. 

For  without  cause  they  have  hidden  their  net  for  me 
unto  destruction :  without  cause  they  have  upbraided 
my  soul. 

Let  the  snare  which  he  knoweth  not  come  upon  him : 
and  let  the  net  which  he  hath  hidden  catch  him:  and 
into  that  very  snare  let  them  fall. 

But  my  soul  shall  rejoice  in  the  Lord;  and  shall  be 
delighted  in  his  salvation. 

All  my  bones  shall  say:  Lord,  who  is  like  to  thee? 

Who  deliverest  the  poor  from  the  hand  of  them  that 
are  stronger  than  he;  the  needy  and  the  poor  from  them 
that  strip  him. 

Unjust  witnesses  rising  up  have  asked  me  things  I 
knew  not. 

They  repaid  me  evil  for  good :  to  the  depriving  me 
of  my  soul. 

But  as  for  me,  when  they  were  troublesome  to  me, 
T  was  clothed  with  haircloth. 

T  humbled  my  soul  with  fasting;  and  my  prayer  shall 
be  turned  into  my  bosom. 

As  a  neighbour  and  as  an  own  brother,  so  did  I 
please:  as  one  mourning  and  sorrowful  so  was  I  hum- 
bled. 

But  they  rejoiced  against  me,  and  came  tos^ether: 
scourges  were  gathered  together  upon  me,  and  I  knew 
not. 

They  were  separated,  and  repented  not:  they  tempted 
me,  they  scofifed  at  me  with  scorn:  they  gnashed  upon 
me  with  their  teeth. 

Lord,  when  wilt  thou  look  upon  me?  rescue  thou  my 
soul  from  their  malice:  my   only  one  from  the  lions. 

T  will  give  thanks  to  thee  in  a  great  church;  I  will 
praise  thee  in  a  strong  people. 


852  Passion  Week 

Let  not  them  that  are  my  enemies  wrongfully  rejoice 
over  me:  who  have  hated  me  without  cause,  and  wink 
with  the  eyes. 

For  they  spoke  indeed  peaceably  to  me;  and  speak- 
ing in  the  anger  of  the  earth  they  devised  guile. 

And  they  opened  their  mouth  wide  against  me;  they 
said:  Well  done,  well  done,  our  eyes  have  seen  it. 

Thou  hast  seen,  O  Lord,  be  not  thou  silent:  O  Lord, 
depart  not  from  me. 

Arise,  and  be  attentive  to  my  judgment:  to  my  cause, 
my  God,  and  my  Lord. 

Judge  me,  O  Lord  my  God  according  to  thy  justice, 
and  let  them  not  rejoice  over  me. 

Let  them  not  say  in  their  hearts:  Tt  is  well,  it  is  well 
to  our  mind  :  neither  let  them  say:  We  have  swallowed 
him  up. 

Let  them  blush  :  and  be  ashamed  together,  who  rejoice 
at  my  evils. 

Let  them  be  clothed  with  confusion  and  shame,  who 
speak  great  things  against  me. 

Let  them  rejoice  and  be  glad,  who  are  well  pleased 
with  my  justice,  and  let  them  say  always:  The  Lord  b'^ 
ma^rnified,  who  deliehts  in  the  p^ace  of  his  servant-. 

And  mv  t^ongue  shall  meditate  thy  justice,  thy  praise 
all  the  day  long. 

Psalm  108 

/^  GOD,  be  not  thou  silent  in  my  praise:  for  the 
^^^  mouth  of  the  wicked  and  the  mouth  of  the  deceit- 
ful man  is  opened  against  me. 

They  have  spoken  against  me  with  deceitful  tongues, 
and  they  have  compassed  me  about  with  words  of  ha- 
tred;  and  have  fought  against  me  without  cause. 

Instead  of  making  me  a  return  of  love,  they  detracted 
me:  but  I  gave  myself  to  prayer. 

And  they  repaid  me  evil  for  good  :  and  hatred  for  my 
love. 

Set  thou  the  sinner  over  him  :  and  may  the  devil  stand 
at  his  right  hand. 


Good   Friday  Morning  853 

When  he  is  judged,  may  he  go  out  condemned;  and 
may  his  prayer  be  turned  to  sin. 

May  his  days  he  few;  and  his  bishopric  let  another 
take. 

May  his  children  be  fatherless,  and  his  wife  a  widow. 

Let  his  children  be  carried  about  vagabonds,  and 
beg;  let  them  be  cast  out  of  their  dwellings. 

May  the  usurer  search  all  his  substance:  and  let 
strangers   plunder  his  labours. 

May  there  be  none  to  help  him:  nor  none  to  pity  his 
fatherless  offspring. 

May  his  posterity  be  cut  off;  in  one  generation  may 
his  name  be  blotted  out. 

May  the  iniquity  of  his  fathers  be  remembered  in  the 
sight  of  the  Lord:  and  let  not  the  sin  of  his  mother  be 
blotted  out. 

May  they  be  before  the  Lord  continually,  and  let 
the  memory  of  them  perish  from  the  earth :  because  he 
remembered  not  to  shew  mercy. 

But  persecuted  the  poor  man  and  the  beggar;  and 
the  broken  in  heart,  to  put  him  to  death. 

And  he  loved  cursing,  and  it  shall  come  unto  him: 
and  he  would  not  have  blessing,  and  it  shall  be  far  from 
him. 

And  he  put  on  cursing,  like  a  garment:  and  it  went 
in  like  water  into  his  entrails,  and  like  oil  in  his  bones. 

May  it  be  unto  him  like  a  garment  which  covereth 
him;  and  like  a  girdle  with  which  he  is  girded  con- 
tinually. 

This  is  the  work  of  them  who  detract  me  before  the 
Lord  :  and  who  speak  evils  against  my  soul. 

But  thou,  O  Lord,  do  with  me  for  thy  name's  sake: 
because  thy  mercy  is  sweet. 

Do  thou  deliver  me,  for  T  am  poor  and  needy,  and 
my  heart  is  troubled  within  me. 

I  am  taken  away  like  the  shadow  when  it  declineth, 
and  T  am  shaken  ofT  as  locusts. 

My  knees  are  weakened  through  fasting  :  and  my  flesh 
is  changed  for  oil. 


854  Passion  Week 

And  I  am  become  a  reproach  to  them :  they  saw  me 
and  they  shaked  their  heads. 

Help  me,  O  Lord  my  God ;  save  me  according  to  thy 
mercy. 

And  let  them  know  that  this  is  thy  hand,  and  that 
thou,  O  Lord,  hast  done  it. 

They  will  curse  and  thou  wilt  bless:  let  them  that 
rise  up  against  me  be  confounded:  but  thy  servant  shall 
rejoice. 

Let  them  that  detract  me  be  clothed  with  shame :  and 
let  them  be  covered  with  their  confusion  as  with  a 
double  cloak. 

I  will  give  great  thanks  to  the  Lord  with  my  mouth : 
and  in  the  midst  of  many  I  will  praise  him. 

Because  he  hath  stood  at  the  right  hand  of  the  poor, 
to  save  my  soul  frorn  persecutors.

Good  Friday  Morning  855 

At  thy  venerable  Cross,  O  Lord,  when  the  soldiers 
were  mocking  thee,  the  hosts  of  angels  were  dazzled; 
for  thou  didst  wear  the  crown  of  slander,  thou  who  didst 
adorn  the  earth  with  flowers.  Thou  didst  wear  the  robe 
of  revilement,  O  thou  who  didst  clothe  the  firmament 
with  clouds.  In  this  dispensation,  therefore,  was  known 
thy  compassion,  O  Christ  of  great  mercy.  Glory  to  thee. 

Glory  and  NoWj  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

YVTHE'N  thou  wast  led  to  the  Cross,  O  Lord,  thou 
didst  say.  For  what  act  do  ye  wish,  O  Jews,  to 
crucify  me?  Is  it  because  I  have  strengthened  your 
cripples?  Is  it  because  I  raised  your  dead  as  from 
sleep,  healed  the  woman  with  an  issue  of  blood,  and 
showed  mercy  upon  the  Canaanitish  woman?  For  what 
act,  O  ye  Jews,  desire  ye  my  death?  But  ye  shall  be- 
hold him  whom  ye  have  pierced,  O  law-transgressors, 
and  know  that  he  is  Christ.

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Isaiah  (50:4  to  end) 

'  I  ^HE  Lord  hath  given  me  a  learned  tongue,  that  I 
^  should  know  how  to  uphold  by  word  him  that  is 
weary:  he  wakeneth  in  the  morning,  in  the  morning  he 
wakeneth  my  ear,  that  I  may  hear  him  as  a  master. 

The  Lord  God  hath  opened  my  ear,  and  I  do  not  re- 
sist :  I  have  not  gone  back. 

I  have  given  my  body  to  the  strikers,  and  my  cheeks 
to  them  that  plucked  them:  I  have  not  turned  away 
my  face  from  them  that  rebuked  me,  and  spit  upon  me. 

The  Lord  God  is  my  helper,  therefore  am  I  not  con- 
founded :  therefore  have  I  set  my  face  as  a  most  hard 
rock,  and  I  know  that  I  shall  not  be  confounded. 

He  is  near  that  justifieth  me,  who  will  contend  with 
me?  let  us  stand  together,  who  is  my  adversary?  let  him 
come  near  to  me.

Who  is  there  among  you  that  feareth  the  Lord,  that 
heareth  the  voice  of  his  servant,  that  hath  walked  in 
darkness,  and  hath  no  light?  let  him  hope  in  the  name

Behold  all  you  that  kindle  a  fire,  encompassed  with

which  you  have  kindled :  this  is  done  to  you  by  my 
hand,  you  shall  sleep  in  sorrows. 

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Romans 

(5:640) 

VT'E  brethren:  For  Christ,  when  as  yet  we  were  weak, 
^    according  to  the  time,  died  for  the  ungodly. 

For  scarce  for  a  just  man  will  one  die;  yet  perhaps 
for  a  good  man  some  one  would  dare  to  die. 

But  God  commendeth  his  charity  towards  us;  be- 
cause when  as  yet  we  were  sinners,  according  to  the 
time, 

Christ  died  for  us;  much  more  therefore,  being  now 
justified  by  his  blood,  shall  we  be  saved  from  wrath 
through  him. 

For  if,  when  we  were  enemies,  we  were  reconciled  to 
God  by  the  death  of  his  Son;  much  more,  being  recon- 
ciled, shall  we  be  saved  by  his  life. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (15:16-41) 

AT  that  time:  The  soldiers  led  Christ  away  into  the 
court  of  the  palace,  and  they  called  together  the 
whole  band: 

And  they  clothe  him  with  purple,  and  platting  a 
crown  of  thorns,  they  put  it  upon  him. 

And  they  began  to  salute  him :  Hail,  king  of  the  Jews. 

And  they  struck  his  head  with  a  reed:  and  they  did 

spit  on  him.    And  bowing  their  knees,  they  adored  him. 


Good  Friday  Morning  857 

And  after  they  had  mocked  him,  they  took  off  the 
purple  from  him,  and  put  his  own  garments  on  him, 
and  they  led  him  out  to  crucify  him. 

And  they  forced  one  Simon  a  Cyrenian  who  passed 
by,  coming  out  of  the  country,  the  father  of  Alexander 
and  of  Rufus,  to  take  up  his  cross. 

And  they  bring  him  into  the  place  called  Golgotha, 
which  being  interpreted  is.  The  place  of  Calvary. 

And  they  gave  him  to  drink  wine  mingled  with 
myrrh ;  but  he  took  it  not. 

And  crucifying  him,  they  divided  his  garments,  cast- 
ing lots  upon  them,  what  every  man  should  take. 

And  it  was  the  third  hour,  and  they  crucified  him. 

And  the  inscription  of  his  cause  was  written  over: 
The  King  of  the  Jews. 

And  with  him  they  crucify  two  thieves ;  the  one  on  his 
right  hand,  and  the  other  on  his  left. 

And  the  scripture  was  fulfilled,  which  saith :  And 
with  the  wicked  he  was  reputed. 

And  they  that  passed  by  blasphemed  him,  wagging 
their  heads,  and  saying:  Vah,  thou  that  destroyest  the 
temple  of  God,  and  in  three  days  buildest  it  up  again; 

Save  thyself,  coming  down  from  the  cross. 

In  like  manner  also  the  chief  priests  mocking,  said 
with  the  scribes  one  to  another:  He  saved  others;  him- 
self he  cannot  save. 

Let  Christ  the  king  of  Israel  come  down  now  from 
the  cross,  that  we  may  see  and  believe.  And  they  that 
were  crucified  with  him  reviled  him. 

And  when  the  sixth  hour  was  come,  there  was  dark- 
ness over  the  whole  earth  until  the  ninth  hour. 

And  at  the  ninth  hour,  Jesus  cried  out  with  a  loud 
voice,  saying:  Eloi,  Eloi,  lamma  sabacthani?  Which 
is,  being  interpreted.  My  God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou 
forsaken  me? 

And  some  of  the  standers  by  hearing,  said  :  Behold  he 
calleth  Elias.

And  one  running  and  filling  a  sponge  with  vinegar, 
and  putting  it  upon  a  reed,  gave  him  to  drink,  saying: 
Stay,  let  us  see  if  Elias  come  to  take  him  down. 

And  Jesus  having  cried  out  with  a  loud  voice,  gave 
up  the  ghost. 

And  the  veil  of  the  temple  was  rent  in  two,  from  the 
top  to  the  bottom. 

And  the  centurion  who  stood  over  against  him,  see- 
ing that  crying  out  in  this  manner  he  had  given  up  the 
ghost,  said :  Indeed  this  man  was  the  son  of  God. 

And  there  were  also  women  looking  on  afar  ofif: 
among  whom  was  Mary  Magdalen,  and  Mary  the 
mother  of  James  the  less  and  of  Joseph,  and  Salome: 

Who  also  when  he  was  in  Galilee  followed  him,  and 
ministered  to  him,  and  many  other  women  that  came 
up  with  him  to  Jerusalem.

For  strangers  have  risen  up  against  me;  and  the 
mighty  have  sought  after  my  soul :  and  they  have  not 
set  God  before  their  eyes. 

For  behold  God  is  my  helper :  and  the  Lord  is.  the 
protector  of  my  soul. 

Turn  back  the  evils  upon  my  enemies;  and  cut  them 
off  in  thy  truth. 

1  will  freely  sacrifice  to  thee,  and  will  give  praise,  O 
God,  to  thy  name:  because  it  is  good: 


Good  Friday  Morning  859 

For  thou  hast  delivered  me  out  of  all  trouble:  and 
my  eye  hath  looked  down  upon  my  enemies. 

Psalm  139 

TAELIVER  me,  O  Lord,  from  the  evil  man:  rescue 
^'^^  me  from  the  unjust  man. 

Who  have  devised  iniquities  in  their  hearts:  all  the 
day  long  they  designed  battles. 

They  have  sharpened  their  tongues  like  a  serpent: 
the  venom  of  asps  is  under  their  lips. 

Keep  me,  O  Lord,  from  the  hand  of  the  wicked :  and 
from  unjust  men  deliver  me. 

Who  have  proposed  to  supplant  my  steps :  the  proud 
have  hidden  a  net  for  me. 

And  they  have  stretched  out  cords  for  a  snare:  they 
have  laid  for  me  a  stumblingblock  by  the  wayside. 

I  said  to  the  Lord :  Thou  art  my  God :  hear,  O  Lord, 
the  voice  of  my  supplication. 

0  Lord,  Lord,  the  strength  of  my  salvation :  thou  hast 
overshadowed  my  head  in  the  day  of  battle. 

Give  me  not  up,  O  Lord,  from  my  desire  to  the 
wicked:  they  have  plotted  against  me;  do  not  thou  for- 
sake me,  lest  they  should  triumph. 

The  head  of  them  compassing  me  about:  the  labour 
of  their  lips  shall  overwhelm  them. 

Burning  coals  shall  fall  upon  them;  thou  wilt  cast 
them  down  into  the  fire:  in  miseries  they  shall  not  be 
able  to  stand. 

A  man  full  of  tongue  shall  not  be  established  in  the 
earth :  evil  shall  catch  the  unjust  man  unto  destruction. 

1  know  that  the  Lord  will  do  justice  to  the  needy, 
and  will  revenge  the  poor. 

But  as  for  the  just,  they  shall  give  glory  to  thy  name: 
and  the  upright  shall  dwell  with  thy  countenance.

tolled, and  shall  be  exceeding  high. 

As  many  have  been  astonished  at  thee,  so  shall  his 
visage  be  inglorious  among  men,  and  his  form  among 
the  sons  of  men. 


Good  Friday  Morning  861 

He  shall  sprinkle  many  nations,  kings  shall  shut  their 
mouth  at  him :  for  they  to  whom  it  was  not  told  of  him, 
have  seen:  and  they  that  heard  not,  have  beheld. 

Who  hath  believed  our  report?  and  to  whom  is  the 
arm  of  the  Lord  revealed? 

And  he  shall  grow  up  as  a  tender  plant  before  him, 
and  as  a  root  out  of  a  thirsty  ground :  there  is  no  beauty 
in  him,  nor  comeliness;  and  we  have  seen  him,  and 
there  was  no  sightliness,  that  we  should  be  desirous  of 
him: 

Despised,  and  the  most  abject  of  men,  a  man  of  sor- 
rows, and  acquainted  with  infirmity:  and  his  look  was 
as  it  were  hidden  and  despised,  whereupon  we  es- 
teemed him  not. 

Surely  he  hath  borne  our  infirmities  and  carried  our 
sorrows:  and  we  have  thought  him  as  it  were  a  leper, 
and  as  one  struck  by  God  and  afflicted. 

But  he  was  wounded  for  our  iniquities,  he  was 
bruised  for  our  sins:  the  chastisement  of  our  peace  was 
upon  him,  and  by  his  bruises  we  are  healed. 

All  we  like  sheep  have  gone  astray,  every  one  hath 
turned  aside  into  his  own  way:  and  the  Lord  hath  laid 
on  him  the  iniquity  of  us  all. 

He  was  ofifered  because  it  was  his  own  will,  and  he 
opened  not  his  mouth :  he  shall  be  led  as  a  sheep  to  the 
slaughter,  and  shall  be  dumb  as  a  lamb  before  his 
shearer,  and  he  shall  not  open  his  mouth. 

He  was  taken  away  from  distress,  and  from  judg- 
ment: who  shall  declare  his  generation?  Because  he  is 
cut  off  out  of  the  land  of  the  living:  for  the  wickedness 
of  my  people  have  I  struck  him. 

And  he  shall  give  the  ungodly  for  his  burial,  and  the 
rich  for  his  death:  because  he  hath  done  no  iniquity, 
neither  was  there  deceit  in  his  mouth. 

And  the  Lord  was  pleased  to  bruise  him  in  infirmity: 
if  he  shall  lay  down  his  life  for  sin,  he  shall  see  a  long- 
lived  seed,  and  the  will  of  the  T>ord  shall  be  prospcrou'^. 
in  his  hand.

filled :  by  his  knowledge  shall  this  my  just  servant  jus-

Therefore  will  I  distribute  to  him  very  many,  and 
he  shall  divide  the  spoils  of  the  strong,  because  he  hath 
delivered  his  soul  unto  death,  and  was  reputed  with  the 
wicked :  and  he  hath  borne  the  sins  of  many,  and  hath 
prayed  for  the  transgressors. 

Give  praise,  O  thou  barren,  that  bearest  not:  sin^ 
forth  praise,  and  make  a  joyful  noise,  thou  that  didst

unto  my  soul. 
I  stick  fast  in  the  mire  of  the  deep:  and  there  is  no 
sure  standing. 

I  am  come  into  the  depth  of  the  sea :  and  a  tempest 
hath  overwhelmed  me. 

I  have  laboured  with  crying;  my  jaws  are  become 
hoarse:  my  eyes  have  failed,  whilst  I  hope  in  my  God. 


Good  Friday  Morning  863 

They  are  multiplied  above  the  hairs  of  my  head,  who 
hate  me  without  cause.  My  enemies  are  grown  strong 
who  have  wTongfully  persecuted  me :  then  did  I  pay 
that  which  I  took  not  away. 

0  God,  thou  knowest  my  foolishness;  and  my  of- 
fences are  not  hidden  from  thee : 

Let  not  them  be  ashamed  for  me,  who  look  for  thee  O 
Lord,  the  Lord  of  hosts. 

Let  them  not  be  confounded  on  my  account,  who  seek 
thee,  O  God  of  Israel. 

Because  for  thy  sake  I  have  borne  reproach,  shame 
hath  covered  my  face. 

1  am  become  a  stranger  to  my  brethren,  and  an  alien 
to  the  sons  of  my  mother. 

For  the  zeal  of  thy  house  hath  eaten  me  up:  and  the 
reproaches  of  them  that  reproached  thee  are  fallen  upon 
me. 

And  I  covered  my  soul  in  fasting:  and  it  was  made  a 
reproach  to  me. 

And  I  made  haircloth  my  garment:  and  I  became  a 
byword  to  them. 

They  that  sat  in  the  gate  spoke  against  me :  and  they 
that  drank  wine  made  me  their  song. 

But  as  for  me,  my  prayer  is  to  thee,  O  Lord;  for  the 
time  of  thy  good  pleasure,  O  God.  In  the  multitude  of 
thv  mercy  hear  me,  in  the  truth  of  thy  salvation. 

Draw  me  out  of  the  mire,  that  I  may  not  stick  fast: 
deliver  me  from  them  that  hate  me,  and  out  of  the  deep 
waters. 

Let  not  the  tempest  of  water  drown  me,  nor  the  deep 
swallow  me  up :  and  let  not  the  pit  shut  her  mouth  upon 
me. 

Hear  me,  O  Lord,  for  thy  mercy  is  kind;  look  upon 
me  according  to  the  multitude  of  thy  tender  mercies. 

And  turn  not  away  thy  face  from  thy  servant:  for  I 
am  in  trouble,  hear  me  speedily. 

Attend  to  my  soul,  and  deliver  it:  save  me  because 
of  my  enemies.

Thou  knowest  my  reproach,  and  my  confusion  and 
my  shame. 

In  thy  sight  are  all  they  that  afflict  me ;  my  heart  hath 
expected  reproach  and  misery. 

And  I  looked  for  one  that  would  grieve  together  with 
me,  but  there  was  none :  and  for  one  that  would  comfort 
me,  and  I  found  none. 

And  they  gave  me  gall  for  my  food,  and  in  my  thirst 
they  gave  me  vinegar  to  drink. 

Let  their  table  become  as  a  snare  before  them,  and  a 
recompense,  and  a  stumblingblock. 

Let  their  eyes  be  darkened  that  they  see  not;  and  their 
back  bend  thou  down  always. 

Pour  out  thy  indignation  upon  them:  and  let  thy 
wrathful  anger  take  hold  of  them. 

Let  their  habitation  be  made  desolate:  and  let  there 
be  none  to  dwell  in  their  tabernacles. 

Because  they  have  persecuted  him  whom  thou  hast 
smitten ;  and  they  have  added  to  the  grief  of  my  wounds. 

Add  thou  iniquity  upon  their  iniquity:  and  let  them 
not  come  into  thy  justice. 

Let  them  be  blotted  out  of  the  book  of  the  living  and 
with  the  just  let  them  not  be  written. 

But  I  am  poor  and  sorrowful :  thy  salvation,  O  God, 
hath  set  me  up. 

I  will  praise  the  name  of  God  with  a  canticle;  and  I 
will  magnify  him  with  praise. 

And  it  shall  please  God  better  than  a  young  calf,  that 
bringeth  forth  horns  and  hoofs. 

Let  the  poor  see  and  rejoice:  seek  ye  God,  and  your 
soul  shall  live. 

For  the  Lord  hath  heard  the  poor;  and  hath  not  de- 
spised his  prisoners. 

Let  the  heavens  and  the  earth  praise  him;  the  sea, 
and  every  thing  that  creepeth  therein. 

For  God  will  save  Sion,  and  the  cities  of  Juda  shall 
be  built  up. 

And  they  shall  dwell  there,  and  acquire  it  by  inherit- 
ance.

And  who  before  me  delivered  you  from  sorrow?  And

Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Jeremiah  the  Prophet 
(11:18  to  end;  12:1-5,  9-10,  14-15) 

OUT  thou,  O  Lord,  hast  shown  me,  and  I  have 
known:  then  thou  showedst  me  their  doings. 

And  I  was  as  a  meek  lamb,  that  is  carried  to  be  a 
victim :  and  I  knew  not  that  they  had  devised  counsels 
against  me,  saying:  Let  us  put  wood  on  his  bread,  and 
cut  him  off  from  the  land  of  the  living,  and  let  his  name 
be  remembered  no  more. 

But  thou,  O  Lord  of  Sabaoth,  who  judgest  justly,  and 
triest  the  reins  and  the  hearts,  let  me  see  thy  revenge  on 
them :  for  to  thee  have  I  revealed  my  cause. 

Therefore  thus  saith  the  Lord  to  the  men  of  Ana- 
thoth,  who  seek  thy  life,  and  say:  Thou  shalt  not 
prophesy  in  the  name  of  the  Lord,  and  thou  shalt  not 
die  in  our  hands. 

Therefore  thus  saith  the  Lord  of  hosts:  behold  I  will 
visit  upon  them  :  their  young  men  shall  die  by  the  sword, 
their  sons  and  their  daughters  shall  die  by  famine. 

And  there  shall  be  no  remains  of  them:  for  I  will 
bring  in  evil  upon  the  men  of  Anathoth,  the  year  of 
their  visitation. 

Thou  indeed,  O  Lord,  art  just,  if  I  plead  with  thee, 
but  yet  I  will  speak  what  is  just  to  thee:  Why  doth  the 
way  of  the  wicked  prosper  :  why  is  it  well  with  all  them 
that  transgress,  and  do  wickedly? 


Good  Friday  Morning  867 

Thou  hast  planted  them,  and  they  have  taken  root; 
they  prosper  and  bring  forth  fruit :  thou  art  near  in  their 
mouth,  and  far  from  their  reins. 

And  thou,  O  Lord,  hast  known  me,  thou  hast  seen  me, 
and  proved  my  heart  with  thee :  gather  them  together  as 
sheep  for  a  sacrifice,  and  prepare  them  for  the  day  of 
slaughter. 

How  long  shall  the  land  mourn,  and  the  herb  of 
every  field  wither  for  the  wickedness  of  them  that  dwell 
therein?  The  beasts  and  the  birds  are  consumed:  be- 
cause they  have  said:  He  shall  not  see  our  last  end. 

If  thou  hast  been  wearied  with  running  with  foot- 
men, how  canst  thou  contend  with  horses?  and  if  thou 
hast  been  secure  in  a  land  of  peace,  what  wilt  thou  do 
in  the  swelling  of  the  Jordan? 

Is  my  inheritance  to  me  as  a  speckled  bird?  is  it  as  a 
bird  dyed  throughout?  come  ye,  assemble  yourselves,  all 
ye  beasts  of  the  earth,  make  haste  to  devour. 

Many  pastors  have  destroyed  my  vineyard,  they  have 
trodden  my  portion  under  foot:  they  have  changed  my 
delightful  portion  into  a  desolate  wilderness. 

They  have  laid  it  waste,  and  it  hath  mourned  for  me. 
With  desolation  is  all  the  land  made  desolate. 

Thus  saith  the  Lord  against  all  my  wicked  neigh- 
bours, that  touch  the  inheritance  that  I  have  shared  out 
to  my  people  Israel:  Behold  I  will  pluck  them  out  of 
their  land,  and  I  will  pluck  the  house  of  Juda  out  of 
the  midst  of  them. 

And  when  I  shall  have  plucked  them  out,  I  will  re- 
turn, and  have  mercy  on  them:  and  I  will  bring  them 
back,  every  man  to  his  inheritance,  and  every  man  into 
his  land.

entering  into  the  holies  by  the  blood  of  Christ;

868  Passion  Week 

And  a  high  priest  over  the  house  of  God  : 

Let  us  draw  near  with  a  true  heart  in  fulness  of  faith, 
having  our  hearts  sprinkled  from  an  evil  conscience, 
and  our  bodies  washed  with  clean  water. 

Let  us  hold  fast  the  confession  of  our  hope  without 
wavering  (for  he  is  faithful  that  hath  promised). 

And  let  us  consider  one  another,  to  provoke  unto 
charity  and  to  good  works : 

Not  forsaking  our  assembly,  as  some  are  accustomed; 
but  comforting  one  another,  and  so  much  the  more  as 
you  see  the  day  approaching. 

For  if  we  sin  wilfully  after  having  the  knowledge 
of  the  truth,  there  is  now  left  no  sacrifice  for  sins, 

But  a  certain  dreadful  expectation  of  judgment,  and 
the  rage  of  a  fire  which  shall  consume  the  adversaries. 

A  man  making  void  the  law  of  Moses,  dieth  without 
any  mercy  under  two  or  three  witnesses  : 

How  much  more,  do  you  think  he  deserveth  worse 
punishments,  who  hath  trodden  under  foot  the  Son  of 
God,  and  hath  esteemed  the  blood  of  the  testament  un- 
clean, by  which  he  was  sanctified,  and  hath  oflfered  an 
affront  to  the  Spirit  of  grace? 

For  we  know  him  that  hath  said :  Vengeance  belong- 
eth  to  me,  and  T  will  repay.  And  again :  The  Lord  shall 
judge  his  people. 

It  is  a  fearful  thing  to  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  living 
God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (19:23-37) 

AT  that  time:  When  they  had  crucified  Jesus,  they 
took  his  garments,   (and  they  made  four  parts,  to 
every  soMier  a  part,)  and  also  his  coat.    Now  the  coat 
was  without  seam,  woven  from  the  top  throughout. 

They  said  then  one  to  another:  Let  us  not  cut  it,  but 
let  us  cast  lots  for  it,  whose  it  shall  be:  that  the  scrip- 
ture might  be  fulfilled,  saying:  They  have  parted  my 
garments  among  them,  nnd  upon  my  vesture  they  have 
cast  lots.    And  the  soldiers  indeed  did  these  things.

disciple  standing  whom  he  loved,  he  saith  to  his  mother  : 
Woman,  behold  thy  son. 

After  that,  he  saith  to  the  disciple :  Behold  thy 
mother.  And  from  that  hour,  the  disciple  took  her  to 
his  own. 

Afterwards,  Jesus  knowing  that  all  things  were  now 
accomplished,  that  the  scripture  might  be  fulfilled, 
said:     I  thirst. 

Now  there  was  a  vessel  set  there,  full  of  vinegar.  And 
they,  putting  a  sponge  full  of  vinegar  about  hyssop, 
put  it  to  his  mouth. 

When  Jesus,  therefore,  had  taken  the  vinegar,  he 
said:  It  is  consummated.  And  bowing  his  head,  he 
gave  up  the  ghost. 

Then  the  Jews,  (because  it  was  the  parasceve,)  that 
the  bodies  should  not  remain  upon  the  cross  on  the  sab- 
bath day,  (for  that  was  a  great  sabbath  day,)  besought 
Pilate  that  their  legs  might  be  broken,  and  that  they 
might  be  taken  away. 

The  soldiers  therefore  came;  and  they  broke  the  legs 
of  the  first,  and  of  the  other  that  was  crucified  with  him. 

But  after  they  were  come  to  Jesus,  when  they  saw 
that  he  was  already  dead,  they  did  not  break  his  legs. 

But  one  of  the  soldiers  with  a  spear  opened  his  side, 
and  immediately  there  came  out  blood  and  water. 

And  he  that  saw  it,  hath  given  testimony  and  his  tes- 
timony is  true.  And  he  knoweth  that  he  saith  true; 
that  you  also  may  believe. 

For  these  things  were  done,  that  the  Scripture  might 
be  fulfilled ;  You  shall  not  break  a  bone  of  him. 

And  again  another  scripture  saith:  They  shall  look 
on  him  whom  they  pierced.

They  parted  my  garments  among  them,  and  upon  my 
vesture,  did  they  cast  lots. 

Mv  God,  my  God,  look  upon  me.  Why  hast  thou 
forsaken  me? 

Reading :  from  the  Book  of  Exodus  (33 :11  to  end) 

A  ND  the  Lord  spoke  unto  Moses  face  to  face,  as  a 
man   speaketh   unto   his   friend.     And   he   turned 
again  into  the  camp;  but  his  servant  Joshua,  the  son 
of  Nun,  a  young  man,  departed  not  out  of  the  taber- 
nacle. 

And  Moses  said  unto  the  Lord,  See  thou  sayest  unto 
me.  Bring  up  this  people :  and  thou  hast  not  let  me  know 
whom  thou  wilt  send  with  me.  Yet  thou  hast  said,  I 
know  thee  by  name,  and  thou  hast  also  found  grace  in 
my  sight.

Now  therefore,  I  pray  thee,  if  I  have  found  grace  in 
thy  sight,  show  me  now  thy  way,  that  I  may  know  thee, 
that  I  may  find  grace  in  thy  sight:  and  consider  that 
this  nation  is  thy  people. 

And  he  said,  My  presence  shall  go  with  thee,  and  I 
will  give  thee  rest. 

And  he  said  unto  him,  If  thy  presence  go  not  with 
me,  carry  us  not  up  hence. 

For  wherein  shall  it  be  known  here  that  I  and  thy 
people  have  found  grace  in  thy  sight?  is  it  not  in  that 
thou  goest  with  us?  So  shall  we  be  separated,  I  and 
thy  people,  from  all  the  people  that  are  upon  the  face 
of  the  earth. 

And  the  Lord  said  unto  Moses,  I  will  do  this  thing 
also  that  thou  hast  spoken:  for  thou  hast  found  grace 
in  my  sight,  and  I  know  thee  by  name. 

And  he  said,  I  beseech  thee,  show  me  thy  glory. 

And  he  said,  I  will  make  all  my  goodness  pass  before 
thee,  and  I  will  proclaim  the  name  of  the  Lord  before 
thee;  and  will  be  gracious  to  whom  I  will  be  gracious, 
and  will  show  mercy  on  whom  I  will  show  mercy. 

And  he  said.  Thou  canst  not  see  my  face:  for  there 
shall  no  man  see  me,  and  live. 

And  the  Lord  said.  Behold,  there  is  a  place  by  me, 
and  thou  shalt  stand  upon  a  rock: 

And  it  shall  come  to  pass,  while  my  glory  passeth 
by,  that  I  will  put  thee  in  a  cleft  of  the  rock,  and  will 
cover  thee  with  my  hand  while  I  pass  by: 

And  I  will  take  away  mine  hand,  and  thou  shah  see 
my  back  parts;  but  my  face  shall  not  be  seen.

Reading :  from  the  Book  of  Job  the  Righteous 
(42:12  to  end) 

CO  the  Lord  blessed  the  latter  end  of  Job  more  than 

his  beginning:  for  he  had  fourteen  thousand  sheep, 
and  six  thousand  camels,  and  a  thousand  yoke  of  oxen, 
and  a  thousand  she  asses. 

He  had  also  seven  sons  and  three  daughters. 

And  he  called  the  name  of  the  first,  Jemima;  and  the 
name  of  the  second,  Kezia;  and  the  name  of  the  third, 
Kerenhappuch. 

And  in  all  the  land  under  the  firmament  of  heaven 
were  no  women  found  so  fair  as  the  daughters  of  Job: 
and  their  father  gave  them  inheritance  among  their 
brethren. 

And  after  the  affliction  lived  Job  a  hundred  and  forty 
years  and  saw  his  sons,  and  his  sons'  sons,  even  four 
generations. 

So  Job  died,  being  old  and  full  of  days.  The  same 
dwelt  in  Hauran,  on  the  borders  of  Edom  and  Arabia. 
And  he  was  called  Yobab,  and  he  took  unto  himself  a 
wife,  an  Arabian  woman,  and  she  bore  him  a  son  called 
Hannoun.  And  Job's  father  was  Zerah,  the  son  of 
Esau,  making  him  the  fifth  in  descent  from  Abraham. 
And  it  was  also  written  that  he  will  rise  with  those 
whom  our  Lord  shall  raise. ^ 

The  Third  Reading

The  Epistle 

They  have  laid  me  in  the  lower  pits  in  the  dark

O  Lord,  the  God  of  my  salvation:  I  have  cried  in  the

Section  from  the  First  Epistle  of  St,  Paul  to  the 
Corinthians  (1 :18  to  end;  2:1-2) 

'YT'E  brethren :  For  the  preaching  of  the  cross  is  to  them 
that  perish  foolishness;  but  unto  us  which  are  saved 
it  is  the  power  of  God. 

For  it  is  written,  I  will  destroy  the  wisdom  of  the 
wise,  and  will  bring  to  nothing  the  understanding  of 
the  prudent. 

Where  is  the  wise?  Where  is  the  scribe?  Where  is 
the  disputer  of  this  world?  Hath  not  God  made  foolish 
the  wisdom  of  this  world? 

For  after  that  in  the  wisdom  of  God  the  world  by  wis- 
dom knew  not  God,  it  pleased  God  by  the  foolishness 
of  preaching  to  save  them  that  believe. 

For  the  Jews  require  a  sign,  and  the  Greeks  seek  after 
wisdom: 

But  we  preach  Christ  crucified,  unto  the  Jews  a  stum- 
blingblock,  and  unto  the  Greeks  foolishness; 

But  unto  them  which  are  called,  both  Jews  and 
Greeks,  Christ  the  power  of  God,  and  the  wisdom  of 
God. 

Because  the  foolishness  of  God  is  wiser  than  men; 
and  the  weakness  of  God  is  stronger  than  men. 

For  ye  see  your  calling,  brethren,  how  that  not  many 
wise  men  after  the  flesh,  not  many  mighty,  not  many 
noble,  are  called : 

But  God  hath  chosen  the  foolish  things  of  the  world 
to  confound  the  wise;  and  God  hath  chosen  the  weak 
things  of  the  world  to  confound  the  things  which  are 
mighty; 

And  base  things  of  the  world,  and  things  which  are 
despised,  hath  God  chosen,  yea,  and  things  which  are 
not,  to  brin^  to  nought  things  that  are: 

That  no  flesh  should  glory  in  his  presence. 

But  of  him  are  ye  in  Christ  Jesus,  who  of  God  is  made 
unto  us  wisdom,  and  righteousness,  and  sanctification, 
and  redemption: 

That,  according  as  it  is  written,  He  that  glorieth,  let 
him  glory  in  the  Lord. 


Good  Friday  Evening  875 

And  I,  brethren,  when  1  came  to  you,  came  not  with 
excellency  of  speech  or  of  wisdom,  declaring  unto  you 
the  testimony  of  God. 

For  I  determined  not  to  know  any  thing  among  you, 
save  Jesus  Christ,  and  him  crucified. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (27 :l-38;  St.  Luke 
23:39-43;  St.  Matthew  27:39-54;  St.  John  19:31- 
37;  St.  Matthew  27:55-61). 

AT  that  time:  All  the  chief  priests  and  elders  of  the 
people  took  counsel  against  Jesus  to  put  him  to 
death ; 

And  when  they  had  bound  him,  they  led  him  away, 
and  delivered  him  to  Pontius  Pilate  the  governor. 

Then  Judas,  which  had  betrayed  him,  when  he  saw 
that  he  was  condemned,  repented  himself,  and  brought 
again  the  thirty  pieces  of  silver  to  the  chief  priests  and 
elders, 

Saying,  I  have  sinned  in  that  I  have  betrayed  the  in- 
nocent blood.  And  they  said.  What  is  that  to  us?  See 
thou  to  that. 

And  he  cast  down  the  pieces  of  silver  in  the  temple, 
and  departed,  and  went  and  hanged  himself  with  a 
halter. 

And  the  chief  priests  took  the  silver  pieces,  and  said, 
Tt  is  not  lawful  for  to  put  them  into  the  treasury,  be- 
cause it  is  the  price  of  blood. 

And  they  took  counsel,  and  bought  with  them  the 
potter's  field,  to  bury  strangers  in. 

Wherefore  that  field  was  called,  the  field  of  blood, 
unto  this  day. 

Then  was  fulfilled  that  which  was  spoken  by  Jeremy 
the  prophet,  saying.  And  they  took  the  thirty  pieces  of 
silver,  the  price  of  him  that  was  valued,  whom  they  of 
the  children  of  Israel  did  value; 

And  gave  them  for  the  potter's  field,  as  the  Lord 
appointed  me.

And  Jesus  stood  before  the  governor:  and  the  gov- 
ernor asked  him,  saying,  Art  thou  the  King  of  the 
Jews?    And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Thou  sayest. 

And  when  he  was  accused  of  the  chief  priests  and 
elders,  he  answered  nothing. 

Then  said  Pilate  unto  him,  Hearest  thou  not  how 
many  things  they  witness  against  thee? 

And  he  answered  him  to  never  a  word;  insomuch  that 
the  governor  marvelled  greatly. 

Now  at  that  feast  the  governor  was  wont  to  release 
unto  the  people  a  prisoner,  whom  they  would. 

And  they  had  then  a  notable  prisoner,  called  Bar- 
abbas. 

Therefore  when  they  were  gathered  together,  Pilate 
said  unto  them.  Whom  will  ye  that  I  release  unto  you? 
Barabbas,  or  Jesus  which  is  called  Christ? 

For  he  knew  that  for  envy  they  had  delivered  him. 

When  he  was  set  down  on  the  judgment  seat,  his  wife 
sent  unto  him,  saying.  Have  thou  nothing  to  do  with 
that  just  man:  for  I  have  suffered  many  things  this  day 
in  a  dream  because  of  him. 

But  the  chief  priests  and  elders  persuaded  the  multi- 
tude that  they  should  ask  Barabbas,  and  destroy  Jesus. 

The  governor  answered  and  said  unto  them,  Whether 
of  the  twain  will  ye  that  I  release  unto  you?  They  said, 
Barabbas. 

Pilate  saith  unto  them.  What  shall  I  do  then  with 
Jesus  which  is  called  Christ?  They  all  say  unto  him, 
Let  him  be  crucified. 

And  the  governor  said.  Why,  what  evil  hath  he  done? 
But  they  cried  out  the  more,  saying.  Let  him  be  cruci- 
fied. 

When  Pilate  saw  that  he  could  prevail  nothing,  but 
that  rather  a  tumult  was  made,  he  took  water,  and 
washed  his  hands  before  the  multitude,  saying,  I  am 
innocent  of  the  blood  of  this  just  person :  see  ye  to  it. 

Then  answered  all  the  people,  and  said,  His  blood 
be  on  us.  and  on  our  children. 


Good  P>iday  Evening  877 

Then  released  he  Barabbas  unto  them :  and  when  he 
had  scourged  Jesus,  he  delivered  him  to  be  crucified. 

Then  the  soldiers  of  the  governor  took  Jesus  into  the 
common  hall,  and  gathered  unto  him  the  whole  band  of 
soldiers. 

And  they  stripped  him,  and  put  on  him  a  scarlet  robe. 

And  when  they  had  platted  a  crown  of  thorns,  they 
put  it  upon  his  head,  and  a  reed  in  his  right  hand:  and 
they  bowed  the  knee  before  him,  and  mocked  him,  say- 
ing, Hail,  King  of  the  Jews! 

And  they  spit  upon  him,  and  took  the  reed,  and  smote 
him  on  the  head. 

And  after  that  they  had  mocked  him,  they  took  the 
robe  ofif  from  him,  and  put  his  own  raiment  on  him, 
and  led  him  away  to  crucify  him. 

And  as  they  came  out,  they  found  a  man  of  Cyrene, 
Simon  by  name:  him  they  compelled  to  bear  his  cross. 

And  when  they  were  come  unto  a  place  called  Gol- 
gotha, that  is  to  say,  a  place  of  a  skull, 

They  gave  him  vinegar  to  drink  mingled  with  gall: 
and  when  he  had  tasted  thereof,  he  would  not  drink. 

And  they  crucified  him,  and  parted  his  garments, 
casting  lots :  that  it  mieht  be  fulfilled  which  was  spoken 
bv  the  proohet.  They  parted  my  garments  among  them, 
and  upon  my  vesture  did  they  cast  lots. 

And  sitting  down  they  watched  him  there; 

And  set  uo  over  his  head  his  accusation  written.  This 
is  Tesus  the  King  of  the  Jews. 

Then  were  there  two  thieves  crucified  with  him;  one 
on  the  ri^ht  hand,  and  another  on  the  left. 

And  one  of  the  malefactors  which  were  hanged  railed 
on  him.  sayinq^,  Tf  thou  be  Christ,  save  thyself  and  us. 

Rut  the  other  answering  rebuked  him,  saying,  Dost 
not  thou  fear  God,  seeing  thou  art  in  the  same  condem- 
nation? 

And  we  indeed  justly;  for  we  receive  the  due  reward 
of  our  deeds  :-but  this  man  hath  done  nothing  amiss. 

And  he  said  unto  T^sus.  Lord,  remember  me  when 
thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom. 


878  Passion  Week 

And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Verily  I  say  unto  thee,  To 
day  shalt  thou  be  with  me  in  paradise. 

And  they  that  passed  by  reviled  him,  wagging  their 
heads, 

And  saying,  Thou  that  destroyest  the  temple,  and 
buildest  it  in  three  days,  save  thyself.  If  thou  be  the 
Son  of  God,  come  down  from  the  cross. 

Likewise  also  the  chief  priests  mocking  him,  with  the 
scribes  and  elders,  said, 

He  saved  others;  himself  he  cannot  save.  If  he  be 
the  King  of  Israel,  let  him  now  come  down  from  the 
cross,  and  we  will  believe  him. 

He  trusted  in  God;  let  him  deliver  him  now,  if  he 
will  have  him:  for  he  said,  I  am  the  Son  of  God. 

The  thieves  also,  which  were  crucified  with  him,  cast 
the  same  in  his  teeth. 

Now  from  the  sixth  hour  there  was  darkness  over 
all  the  land  unto  the  ninth  hour. 

And  about  the  ninth  hour  Jesus  cried  with  a  loud 
voice,  saying,  Eli,  Eli,  lama  sabachthani?  that  is  to  say, 
My  God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me? 

Some  of  them  that  stood  there,  when  they  heard  that 
said,  This  man  calleth  for  Elias. 

And  straightway  one  of  them  ran,  and  took  a  sponge, 
and  filled  it  with  vinegar,  and  put  it  on  a  reed,  and  gave 
him  to  drink. 

The  rest  said.  Let  be,  let  us  see  whether  Elias  will 
come  to  save  him. 

Jesus,  when  he  had  cried  again  with  a  loud  voice, 
yielded  up  the  ghost. 

And,  behold,  the  veil  of  the  temple  was  rent  in  twain 
from  the  top  to  the  bottom;  and  the  earth  did  quake, 
and  the  rocks  rent; 

And  the  graves  were  opened ;  and  many  bodies  of  the 
saints  which  slept  arose. 

And  came  out  of  the  graves  after  his  resurrection, 
and  went  into  the  holy  city,  and  appeared. unto  many. 

Now  when  the  centurion,  and  they  that  were  with 
him,  watching  Jesus,  saw  the  earthquake,  and   those 


Good  Friday  Evening  879 

things  that  were  done,  they  feared  greatly,  saying,  Truly 
this  was  the  Son  of  God. 

Then  the  Jews,  (because  it  was  the  parasceve),  that 
the  bodies  should  not  remain  upon  the  cross  on  the  sab- 
bath day,  (for  that  was  a  great  sabbath  day)  besought 
Pilate  that  their  legs  might  be  broken,  and  that  they 
might  be  taken  away. 

The  soldiers  therefore  came:  and  they  broke  the  legs 
of  the  first,  and  of  the  other  that  was  crucified  with  him. 

But  after  they  were  come  to  Jesus,  and  saw  that  he 
was  already  dead,  they  did  not  break  his  legs. 

But  one  of  the  soldiers  with  a  spear  opened  his  side: 
and  immediately  there  came  out  blood  and  water. 

And  he  that  saw  it,  hath  given  testimony;  and  his 
testimony  is  true.  And  he  knoweth  that  he  saith  true; 
that  you  also  may  believe. 

For  these  things  were  done,  that  the  Scripture  might 
be  fulfilled:  You  shall  not  break  a  bone  of  him. 

And  again  another  Scripture  saith:  They  shall  look 
on  him  whom  they  pierced. 

And  many  women  were  there  beholding  afar  off, 
which  followed  Jesus  from  Galilee,  ministering  unto 
him: 

Among  which  was  Mary  Magdalene,  and  Mary  the 
mother  of  James  and  Joseph,  and  the  mother  of  Zebe- 
dee's  children. 

When  the  even  was  come,  there  came  a  rich  man  of 
Arimathea,  named  Joseph,  who  also  himself  was  Jesus' 
disciple: 

He  went  to  Pilate,  and  begged  the  body  of  Jesus. 
Then  Pilate  commanded  the  body  to  be  delivered. 

And  when  Joseph  had  taken  the  body,  he  wrapped 
it  in  a  clean  linen  cloth. 

And  laid  it  in  his  own  new  tomb,  which  he  had  hewn 
out  in  the  rock;  and  he  rolled  a  great  stone  to  the  door 
of  the  sepulchre,  and  departed. 

And  there  was  Mary  Magdalene,  and  the  other 
Mary,  sitting  over  against  the  sepulchre.

they  come  to  the  center,  where  the  bier  is  stationed,  adorned  with 
flowers.  They  circle  around  it  three  times,  then  place  the  Epitaphion 
over  the  bier,  and  the  Gospel  Book  over  the  Epitaphion.  And  after

brought  thee  down  dead  from  the  Cross,  he  laid 
thee  in  balms  and  linen,  hastening  anxiously  to  kiss  thy 
lips  and  bury  thy  pure  body  free  of  corruption.  But 
he  was  reverent  with  fear  as  he  cried  to  thee  with  joy, 
Glory  be  to  thy  condescension,  O  Lover  of  mankind.

Hades,  made  ridiculous  at  seeing  thee,  O  Deliverer 
of  all,  placed  in  a  new  tomb  for  the  sake  of  all,  trem- 
bled with  fear.  Its  locks  were  shattered;  its  doors 
broken;  the  tombs  were  opened;  and  the  dead  awoke. 
Then  Adam  cried  to  thee  with  joy  and  gratitude.  Glory 
to  thy  condescension,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:  For  he  hath  established  the  world  which 
shall  not  be  moved. 

O  Christ,  who  in  thy  divine  Nature  art  boundless 
and  infinite,  when  thou  wast  enclosed  in  the  grave  by 
thine  own  will  after  the  flesh,  thou  didst  close  the  cham- 
bers of  death  and  hades,  and  didst  demolish  all  its  king- 
doms. Then  thou  preparedst  this  Saturday  for  thy 
glory,  thine  illumination,  and  thy  divine  blessing.

The  angelic  hosts,  O  Christ,  beholding  those  lawless 
ones  victimize  thee  as  a  criminal,  and  seeing  the  tomb- 
stone sealed  by  the  hands  of  those  who  pierced  thy  side, 
were  frightened  at  thine  ineffable  long-sufiPering.  Buti 
rejoicing  at  our  salvation,  they  cried  unto  thee.  Glory

Joseph,  with  Nicodemus,  brought  thee  down  from 
the  Tree  and  beheld  thee  dead,  naked,  and  unburied, 
he  mourned  outwardly  and  grieviously,  crying  to  thee 
with  sighs,  and  saying,  Woe  is  me,  sweet  Jesus,  w^hom 
but  a  while  ago,  when  the  sun  beheld  suspended  upon 
the  Cross,  it  was  shrouded  in  darkness,  the  earth  quaked 
with  fear,  and  the  veil  of  the  Temple  was  rent  asunder. 
Albeit,  I  see  that  thou  willingly  enduredst  death 
for  my  sake.  How  then  shall  I  array  thee,  my  God? 
How  shall  I  wrap  thee  with  linen?  Or  \vhat  dirges

grave.  Wherefore,  the  ointment-bearing  women  rose

whose  Burial  the  entrance  of  life  hath  opened  for  me; 
and  who  by  Death  caused  death  and  hades  to  die. 

Verily,  the  super-terrestial,  and  those  below  the  earth, 
beholding  thee  on  thy  throne  on  high  and  in  the  grave 
below,  were  amazed,  trembling  at  thy  Death;  for  thou 
O  Element  of  life,  wast  seen  to  be  dead  in  a  manner 
transcending  the  mind. 

To  the  depths  of  the  earth  thou  descendest  to  fill  all 
with  thy  glory;  for  my  person  that  is  in  Adam  w^as  not 
hidden  from  thee;  and  when  thou  wast  buried  thou 
didst  renew  me,  who  was  corrupt,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Third  Ode — Hermos  ^ 

^X/'ERILY,  creation,  having  beheld  thee  suspended 
on  Golgotha,  O  thou  who  didst  suspend  the  whole 
earth  on  the  w^aters  without  hinges,  was  overtaken  with 
great  surprise,  crying  aloud.  There  is  none  holy  save 
thee,  O  Lord. 

Thou  hast  revealed,  O  Master,  numerous  sights  as 
signs  of  thy  Burial.  But  now  thou  hast  revealed  thy 
hidden  things  as  God  and  Man  to  those  who  are  in 
hades  also,  who  shouted,  saying,  There  is  none  holy  save 
thou,  O  Lord. 

Thou  hast  stretched  forth  thy  hands,  O  Saviour,  and 
gathered  the  things  dispersed  of  old;  and  by  thy  Burial 
in  the  linen  and  the  grave  thou  hast  loosed  the  captives, 
w^ho  shout.  There  is  none  holy  save  thee,  O  Lord. 

A  grave  and  seals  contained  thee  by  thy  will,  O  Un- 
containable;  for  by  deeds,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  thou 
hast  made  thy  power  known  by  a  divine  act  to  those 
who  sing.  There  is  none  holy  save  thee,  O  Lord.

Fourth  Ode — Hermos  ^ 

\TERILY,  Habakuk,  O  good  One,  foresaw  thy  divine 
condescension  even  to  the  Cross;  and  was  dazzled 
as  he  cried.  Thou  abolishedst  the  prestige  of  the  mighty, 
when  thou  didst  appear  in  hades,  since  thou  art  Al- 
mighty. 

Thou  hast  blessed,  O  Saviour,  this  seventh  day,  which 
thou  hadst  blessed  at  the  beginning  with  rest  from 
work:  for  thou  hast  brought  out  everything,  renewing 
it  and  restoring  it  to  its  former  state,  thus  keeping  the 
sabbath. 

Thy  soul,  by  the  power  of  the  best,  hath  vanquished 
the  body,  O  Word,  breaking  the  bonds  of  hades  and 
death  together  by  thy  might. 

Hades  in  welcoming  thee,  O  Word,  murmured  at 
beholdine  a  deified  Man  marked  with  wounds,  who  is 
yet  Almighty.  Wherefore,  at  that  terrible  sight  it 
shouted  in  fear. 

Fifth   Ode — Hermos 

V^/HEN  Isaiah,  O  Christ,  saw  thy  light,  that  setteth 
not,  the  light  of  thy  divine  appearance  coming  to 
us  in  pity,  he  rose  up  early,  crying.  The  dead  shall  rise, 
and  they  who  are  in  the  tombs  shall  awake,  and  all 
those  on  the  earth  shall  rejoice. 

When  thou  becamest  earthly,  O  Creator,  thou  didst 
renew  those  who  are  earthly.  And  the  linen  and  the 
grave  explained  thy  hidden  mystery,  O  Word;  for  the 
honourable  Joseph,  of  sound  belief,  fulfilled  thy 
Father's  plan,  through  whom  thou  hast  renewed  me  by 
the  might  of  his  greatness.

Good  Friday  Night  885 

Thou  hast  transported  the  dead  by  Death,  and  the 
corrupt  by  Burial;  for  as  becometh  God  thou  hast  made 
the  body  which  thou  didst  create  incorrupt  and  death- 
less; for  thy  body,  O  Master,  did  not  see  corruption, 
and  thy  soul  in  a  strange  manner  was  not  left  in  hades. 

Thou  didst  come  from  a  Virgin  who  knew  no  travail. 
Thy  side,  O  my  Creator,  was  pierced  with  a  spear,  by 
which  thou  didst  accomplish  the  re-creation  of  Eve, 
having  thyself  become  Adam.  Supernaturally  thou 
didst  fall  into  a  sleep  that  renewed  nature,  raising  life 
from  sleep  and  corruption;  for  thou  art  Almighty. 

Sixth  Ode — Hermos 

y/^ERILY,  Jonah  the  Prophet  was  caught  but  not 
held  in  the  belly  of  the  whale.  But  being  a  sign 
of  thee,  O  thou  who  didst  suffer  and  wast  delivered 
to  burial,  he  came  out  of  the  whale  as  out  of  a  chamber, 
and  cried  unto  the  watchmen.  In  vain  do  ye  watch,  O 
watchmen;  for  ye  have  neglected  mercy. 

Thou  wast  killed,  O  Word,  but  wast  not  separated 
from  the  body  which  thou  didst  share  with  us;  for  even 
though  thy  temple  were  dissolved  at  the  time  of  the 
Passion,  the  Person  of  thy  Divinity  and  Humanity  is 
one  only;  and  in  both  thou  art  still  a  single  Son,  the 
Word  of  God,  God  and  Man. 

The  fall  of  Adam  resulted  in  the  Death  of  a  Man, 
not  God ;  for  though  the  substance  of  thine  earthly  body 
suflPered,  thy  Divinity  hath  remained  passionless,  trans- 
forming the  corrupt  to  incorruptibility.  And  by  thy 
Resurrection  thou  hast  uncovered  the  incorrupt  foun- 
tain of  life. 

Verily,  hades  ruled  the  race  of  man,  but  not  for  ever; 
for  thou,  Q  mighty  One,  when  thou  wast  placed  in  the 
grave  didst  demolish  the  locks  of  death  with  the  palm  of 
thy  hand,  O  Element  of  life,  proclaiming  to  those  sit- 
ting yonder  from  the  ages  a  true  salvation,  having  be- 
come, O  Saviour,  the  First-born  of  the  dead.

A/EERILY,  the  Almighty  hath  been  elevated  upon  the 
Cross,  and  the  whole  creation  mourned,  seeing  him 
suspended  naked  upon  a  Tree.  The  sun  hid  his  rays, 
and  the  stars  gave  not  their  light;  the  earth  quaked  with 
great  fright,  and  the  sea  ran  away;  the  rocks  were  spilt 
asunder,  and  many  graves  were  opened,  and  the  bodies 
of  holy  men  arose.  Hades  sighed  below,  but  the  Jews 
were  planning  slanders  against  the  Resurrection  of 
Christ;  and  the  women  shouted,  crying,  Behold  the

slept,  to  rise  on  the  third  day. 

Great  Holy  Saturday 

Synaxarion 

/^N  the  Great  Holy  Saturday,  we  celebrate  the 
Burial  of  the  divine  body,  and  the  descent  of  our 
Lord  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ  to  hades,  through  which 
he  restored  our  kind  from  corruption  and  transplanted 
it  to  eternal  life. 

On  the  following  day,  which  was  Saturday,  and 
which  fell  on  the  twenty-fourth  of  March,  the  enemies 
of  God,  the  high  priests  and  Pharisees,  came  to  Pilate 
and  asked  him  to  seal  the  tomb  until  the  third  day,  lest 
the  Disciples  come  at  night,  as  they  claimed,  and  steal 
the  buried  body,  and  then  preach  among  the  people, 
proclaiming  the  truth  of  the  Resurrection,  which  that 


Great  Holy  Saturday  887 

deceiver  had  foretold  when  he  was  alive,  and  the  last 
error  should  be  worse  than  the  first.  Thus  they  ob- 
tained permission  to  seal  the  tomb,  and  so  they  went 
and  sealed  it  and  placed  a  guard  upon  it  from  among 
the  soldiers  who  were  guarding  the  city  (St.  Mat.  27: 
62-66). 

Wherefore,  by  thine  ineffable  condescension,  O 
Christ  our  God,  have  mercy  upon  us.    Amen. 

Seventh  Ode — Hermos 

AN  ineffable  wonder!  He  who  saved  the  righteous 
youths  from  the  fire  of  the  furnace,  hath  been 
placed  in  the  grave,  a  breathless  corpse,  for  our  salva- 
tion and  deliverance,  who  sing.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  de- 
livering God. 

Verily,  hades  was  pierced  and  destroyed  by  the  di- 
vine fire  when  it  received  in  its  heart  him  who  was 
pierced  in  his  side  with  a  spear  for  our  salvation,  who 
sing.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  delivering  God. 

The  tomb  is  happy,  having  become  divine  when  it 
received  within  it  the  Treasure  of  life,  the  Creator, 
as  one  who  slumbereth  for  our  salvation,  who  sing, 
Blessed  art  thou,  O  delivering  God. 

The  Life  of  all  was  willing  to  lie  in  a  grave,  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  law  of  the  dead,  making  it  appear 
as  the  fountain  of  the  resurrection  of  our  salvation,  who 
sing.  Blessed  art  thou,  O  delivering  God. 

The  Godhead  of  Christ  was  one  without  separation 
in  hades,  in  the  tomb,  in  Eden,  and  with  the  Father  and 
the  Spirit,  for  our  salvation,  who  sing.  Blessed  art  thou, 
O  delivering  God.

youths,  bless  him.  Praise  him,  ye  Priests;  and  ye  na- 
tions, exalt  him  more  and  more  unto  all  the  ages. 

The  pure  Temple  hath  been  destroyed,  then  rising, 
he  raised  with  him  the  fallen  tabernacle;  for  the  sec- 
ond Adam  who  dwelleth  in  the  highest  hath  descended 
unto  the  first  Adam  in  the  uttermost  chambers  of  hades. 
Wherefore,  ye  youths,  bless  him.  Praise  him,  ye  Priests; 
and  ye  nations,  exalt  him  more  and  more  unto  all  the 
ages. 

The  courage  of  the  Disciples  hath  come  to  its  end. 
But  Joseph  of  Ramah  hath  shown  great  valour;  for  be- 
holding the  God  of  all  dead  and  naked,  he  sought  him 
and  arrayed  him,  shouting,  O  ye  youths,  bless  him. 
Praise  him  ye  Priests;  and  ye  nations,  exalt  him  more 
and  more  unto  the  end  of  ages. 

O  what  dazzling  wonders !  O  what  endless  goodness ! 
O  what  ineffable  endurance!  For  he  that  dwelleth  in 
the  highest  is  sealed  up  under  the  earth  by  his  own 
will.  God  is  slandered  as  a  misleader.  Wherefore,  O 
ye  youths,  bless  him.  Praise  him,  ye  priests,  and  ye

ennoble  those  who  in  faith  and  longing  magnify  thee. 
My  eternal  Son,  I  escaped  sufferings  at  thy  strange 
Birth  and  was  supernaturally  blessed.  And  now,  be- 
holding thee,  O  my  Son,  dead  and  breathless,  I  am 
pierced  with  the  spear  of  bitter  sorrow.  But  arise  thou, 
that  T  may  be  magnified  by  thee.

Let  all  creation  rejoice,  and  all  the  earthly  be  glad; 
for  hades  and  the  enemy  have  been  spoiled.  Let  the

to  me  the  reason  of  thy  wickedness,  wherein  thou  didst 
deliver  Christ.

Sight;  for  the  Cause  of  life  endured  death,  desiring  to 
revive  all  by  his  Death. 

57.  When  thy  side  was  pierced,  O  Master,  and  thy

T^ODAY  he  who  holdeth  creation  on  the  hollow  of 
his  hand  is  contained  in  a  tomb;  and  he  who  cov- 
ereth  the  heavens  with  virtue  is  covered  by  a  stone. 
Life  slumbereth,  hades  is  alarmed,  and  Adam  is  de- 
livered from  his  bonds.  Wherefore,  glory  be  to  the 
dispensation  through  which  thou  hast  fulfilled  all,  thy 
most  holy  Resurrection  from  the  dead  granting  us  rest 
and  everlasting  sabbath. 

What  is  this  sight  which  we  behold?  What  is  this 
present  rest?  For  the  King  of  the  ages,  having  fulfilled 
the  mystery  of  dispensation  by  the  Passion,  hath  rested, 
keeping  the  sabbath  in  the  tomb,  granting  us  a  new 
sabbath.  Wherefore,  let  us  hail  him.  Arise,  O  God, 
and  Judge  of  the  earth;  for  thou  dost  reign  for  ever- 
more, O  thou  who  possesseth  the  countless  and  Great 
Mercy. 

Come  ye,  let  us  behold  our  Life  placed  in  a  tomb  to

Verily,  Joseph  sought  the  body  of  Jesus  and  placed

of  paradise  for  mankind,  glory  to  thee.

nnHE  great  Moses  foreshadowed  this  day  mystically 
by  his  saying.  And  God  blessed  the  seventh  day; 
for  this  is  the  day  of  quiet  and  rest,  on  which  the  only 
Son  of  God  rested  from  all  his  works,  keeping  sabbath 
in  the  body  (by  means  of  the  mystery  of  the  dispensa- 
tion taking  effect  in  death)  returning  through  Resur- 
rection to  what  he  had  been,  and  granting  us  eternal

him,  crying  out  and  saying,  Give  thou  me  this  Stranger 
who  from  his  youth  has  wandered  like  a  stranger.  Give 
me  this  Stranger  whom  his  kinsmen  killed  in  hatred 
like  a  stranger.  Give  me  this  Stranger  at  whom  I  won- 
der, beholding  him  as  a  Guest  of  death.  Give  me  this 
Stranger  who  knoweth  how  to  take  in  the  poor  and 
strangers.  Give  me  this  Stranger  whom  the  Jews  in 
envy  estranged  from  the  world.    Give  me  this  Stranger

that  I  may  bury  him  in  a  tomb,  who  being  a  Stranger 
hath  no  place  whereon  to  lay  his  head.  Give  me  this 
Stranger,  to  whom  his  Mother,  beholding  him  dead, 
cried.  My  Son  and  my  vitals  be  wounded,  and  my 
heart  burn,  as  I  behold  thee  dead,  yet  trusting  in  thy 
Resurrection,  I  magnify  thee.  In  these  words  the  hon- 
ourable Joseph  pleaded  with  Pilate,  took  the  Saviour's 
body,  and  with  fear  wrapped  it  in  linen  and  balm.  In 
a  tomb  he  placed  thee,  O  thou  who  grantest  to  all  ever- 
lasting life  and  the  Great  Mercy. 

41^When  all  the  Congregation  have  returned  into  the  church,  and 
the  Priests  enter  the  Temple,  the  Proto-priest  exclaimeth,  saying, 
Let  us  hearken!  Peace  be  unto  you  all.  Wisdom!  And  immediately 
the  Choir  sings  the  Troparion,  The  pious  Joseph,  etc.  {once  p. 
881),  as  the  Priests  go  three  times  around  the  holy  Altar  with  the 
Epitaphion,  placing  it  over  the  Altar  where  it  remaineth  to  the  Leave- 
taking  of  Easter.  Then  immediately  the  Reader  readeth  the  follow- 
ing Prophecy. 


Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Ezekiel  the  Prophet 

(37:1-14) 

nr^HE  hand  of  the  Lord  was  upon  me,  and  brought 
me  forth  in  the  spirit  of  the  Lord :  and  set  me  down 
in  the  midst  of  a  plain  that  was  full  of  bones. 

And  he  led  me  about  through  them  on  every  side: 
now  they  were  very  many  upon  the  face  of  the  plain, 
and  they  were  exceeding  dry. 

And  he  said  to  me:  Son  of  man,  dost  thou  think  these 
bones  shall  live?  And  I  answered:  O  Lord  God,  thou 
knowest. 

And  he  said  to  me :  Prophesy  concerning  these  bones ; 
and  say  to  them:  Ye  dry  bones,  hear  the  word  of  the 
Lord. 

Thus  saith  the  Lord  God  to  these  bones:  Behold,  I 
will  send  spirit  into  you,  and  you  shall  live. 

And  I  will  lay  sinews  upon  you,  and  will  cause  flesh 
to  grow  over  you,  and  will  cover  you  with  skin:  and  I 
will  give  you  spirit  and  you  shall  live,  and  you  shall 
know  that  I  am  the  Lord. 


Great  Holy  Saturday  907 

And  I  prophesied  as  he  had  commanded  me :  and  as 
I  prophesied  there  was  a  noise,  and  behold  a  commo- 
tion: and  the  bones  came  together,  each  one  to  its  joint. 

And  I  saw,  and  behold  the  sinews,  and  the  flesh  came 
up  upon  them  :  and  the  skin  was  stretched  out  over  them, 
but  there  was  no  spirit  in  them. 

And  he  said  to  me:  Prophesy  to  the  spirit,  prophesy, 

0  son  of  man,  and  say  to  the  spirit :  Thus  saith  the  Lord 
God :  Come,  spirit,  from  the  four  winds,  and  blow  upon 
these  slain,  and  let  them  live  again. 

And  I  prophesied  as  he  had  commanded  me:  and  the 
spirit  came  into  them,  and  they  lived  :  and  they  stood  up 
upon  their  feet,  an  exceeding  great  army. 

And  he  said  to  me:  Son  of  man:  All  these  bones  are 
the  house  of  Israel:  they  say:  Our  bones  are  dried  up. 
and  our  hope  is  lost,  and  we  are  cut  off. 

Therefore  prophesy,  and  say  to  them:  Thus  saith  the 
Lord  God :  Behold  T  will  open  your  graves,  and  will 
bring  you  out  of  your  sepulchres,  O  my  people  :  and  will 
bring  you  into  the  land  of  Israel. 

And  you  shall  know  that  I  am  the  Lord,  when  I  shall 
have  opened  your  sepulchres,  and  shall  have  brought 
you  out  of  your  graves,  O  my  people: 

And  shall  have  put  my  spirit  in  you,  and  you  shall 
live,  and  I  shall  make  you  rest  upon  your  own  land: 
and  you  shall  know  that  I  the  Lord  have  spoken,  and 
done  it,  saith  the  Lord  God: 

The  Epistle:  Arise,  O  Lord,  let  thy  hand  be  exalted. 

1  will  give  praise  to  thee,  O  Lord,  with  my  whole  heart.

Wherefore,  glory  to  thy  Cross,  O  Lord,  and  to  thy 
Resurrection.

This  month  shall  be  to  you  the  beginning  of  months: 
it  shall  be  the  first  in  the  months  of  the  year. 

Speak  ye  to  the  whole  assembly  of  the  children  of 
Israel,  and  say  to  them :  On  the  tenth  day  of  this  month 
let  every  man  take  a  lamb  by  their  families  and  houses. 

But  if  the  number  be  less  than  may  suffice  to  eat  the 
lamb,  he  shall  take  unto  him  his  neighbour  that  joineth 
to  his  house,  according  to  the  number  of  souls  which 
may  be  enough  to  eat  the  lamb.

And  it  shall  be  a  lamb  without  blemish,  a  male,  of  one 
year:  according  to  which  rite  also  you  shall  take  a  kid. 

And  you  shall  keep  it  until  the  fourteenth  day  of  this 
month:  and  the  whole  multitude  of  the  children  of 
Israel  shall  sacrifice  it  in  the  evening. 

And  they  shall  take  of  the  blood  thereof,  and  put  it 
upon  both  the  side  posts,  and  on  the  upper  door  posts 
of  the  houses,  wherein  they  shall  eat  it. 

And  they  shall  eat  the  flesh  that  night  roasted  at  the 
fire,  and  unleavened  bread  with  wild  lettuce. 

You  shall  not  eat  thereof  any  thing  raw,  nor  boiled 
in  water,  but  only  roasted  at  the  fire:  you  shall  eat  the 
head  with  the  feet  and  entrails  thereof. 

Neither  shall  there  remain  any  thing  of  it  until  morn- 
ing. If  there  be  any  thing  left,  you  shall  burn  it  with 
fire. 

And  thus  you  shall  eat  it:  you  shall  gird  your  reins, 
and  you  shall  have  shoes  on  your  feet,  holding  staves  in 
your  hands,  and  you  shall  eat  in  haste:  for  it  is  the 
Phase  (that  is  the  Passage)  of  the  Lord. 

Third  Reading :  from  the  Prophecy  of  Daniel  the 
Prophet  (3:1-88) 

TN  the  eighteenth  year.  King  Nabuchodonosor  made  a 
statue  of  gold,  of  sixty  cubits  high,  and  six  cubits 
broad,  and  he  set  it  up  in  the  plain  of  Dura  of  the  pro- 
vince of  Babylon. 

Then  Nabuchodonosor  the  king  sent  to  call  together 
the  nobles,  the  magistrates,  and  the  judges,  the  cap- 
tains, the  rulers,  and  governors,  and  all  the  chief  men  of 
the  provinces,  to  come  to  the  dedication  of  the  statue 
which  king  Nabuchodonosor  had  set  up. 

Then  the  nobles,  the  magistrates,  and  the  judges,  the 
captains,  and  rulers,  and  the  great  men  that  were  placed 
in  authority,  and  all  the  princes  of  the  provinces,  were 
gathered  together  to  come  to  the  dedication  of  the  stat- 
ue, which  king  Nabuchodonosor  had  set  up.  And  they 
stood  before  the  statue  which  king  Nabuchodonosor 
had  setup. 


Great  Holy  Saturday  Morning  911 

Then  a  herald  cried  with  a  strong  voice:  To  you  it 
is  commanded,  O  nations,  tribes,  and  languages: 

That  in  the  hour  that  you  shall  hear  the  sound  of  the 
trumpet,  and  of  the  flute,  and  of  the  harp,  of  the  sack- 
but,  and  of  the  psaltery,  and  of  the  symphony,  and  of 
all  kind  of  music;  ye  fall  down  and  adore  the  golden 
statue  which  king  Nabuchodonosor  hath  set  up. 

But  if  any  man  shall  not  fall  down  and  adore,  he  shall 
the  same  hour  be  cast  into  a  furnace  of  burning  fire. 

Upon  this  therefore,  at  the  time  when  all  the  people 
heard  the  sound  of  the  trumpet,  the  flute,  and  the  harp, 
of  the  sackbut,  and  the  psaltery,  of  the  symphony,  and 
of  all  kind  of  music :  all  the  nations,  tribes,  and  langu- 
ages fell  down  and  adored  the  golden  statue  which 
king  Nabuchodonosor  had  set  up. 

And  presently  at  that  very  time  some  Chaldeans  came 
and  accused  the  Jews, 

And  said  to  king  Nabuchodonosor:  O  king,  live  for 
ever: 

Thou,  O  king,  hast  made  a  decree  that  every  man 
that  shall  hear  the  sound  of  the  trumpet,  the  flute,  and 
the  harp,  of  the  sackbut,  and  the  psaltery,  of  the  sym- 
phony, and  of  all  kind  of  music,  shall  prostrate  himself, 
and  adore  the  golden  statue: 

And  that  if  any  man  shall  not  fall  down  and  adore, 
he  should  be  cast  into  a  furnace  of  burning  fire. 

Now  there  are  certain  Jews  whom  thou  hast  set  over 
the  works  of  the  province  of  Babylon,  Sidrach,  Misach, 
and  Abednago :  these  men,  O  king,  have  slighted  thy 
decree:  they  worship  not  thy  gods,  nor  do  they  adore 
the  golden  statue  which  thou  hast  set  up. 

Then  Nabuchodonosor  in  fury,  and  in  wrath,  com- 
manded that  Sidrach,  Misach,  and  Abednago  should  be 
brought:  who  immediately  were  brought  before  the 
king. 

And  Nabuchodonosor  the  king  spoke  to  them,  and 
said :  Is  it  true,  O  Sidrach,  Misach,  and  Abednago,  that 
you  do  not  worship  my  gods,  nor  adore  the  golden 
statue  that  I  have  set  up? 


912  Passion  Week 

Now  therefore  if  you  be  ready  at  what  hour  soever 
you  shall  hear  the  sound  of  the  trumpet,  flute,  harp, 
sackbut,  and  psaltery,  and  symphony,  and  of  all  kinds 
of  music,  prostrate  yourselves,  and  adore  the  statue 
which  I  have  made:  but  if  you  do  not  adore,  you  shall 
be  cast  the  same  hour  into  the  furnace  of  burning  fire : 
and  who  is  the  God  that  shall  deliver  you  out  of  my 
hand? 

Sidrach,  Misach,  and  Adbednago  answered  and  said 
to  king  Nabuchodonosor :  We  have  no  occasion  to 
answer  thee  concerning  this  matter. 

For  behold  our  God,  whom  we  worship,  is  able  to 
save  us  from  the  furnace  of  burning  fire,  and  to  deliver 
us  out  of  thy  hands,  O  king. 

But  if  he  will  not,  be  it  known  to  thee,  O  king,  that 
we  will  not  worship  thy  gods,  nor  adore  the  golden 
statue  which  thou  hast  set  up. 

Then  was  Nabuchodonosor  filled  with  fury:  and  the 
countenance  of  his  face  was  changed  against  Sidrach, 
Misach,  and  Abednago,  and  he  commanded  that  the 
furnace  should  be  heated  seven  times  more  than  it  had 
been  accustomed  to  be  heated. 

And  he  commanded  the  strongest  men  that  were  in 
his  army,  to  bind  the  feet  of  Sidrach,  Misach,  and  Ab- 
ednago, and  to  cast  them  into  the  furnace  of  burning 
fire. 

And  immediately  these  men  were  bound  and  were 
cast  into  the  furnace  of  burning  fire,  with  their  coats, 
and  their  caps,  and  their  shoes,  and  their  garments. 

For  the  king's  commandment  was  urgent,  and  the 
furnace  was  heated  exceedingly.  And  the  flame  of  the 
fires  slew  those  men  that  had  cast  in  Sidrach,  Misach, 
and  Abednago. 

But  these  three  men,  that  is,  Sidrach,  Misach,  and  Ab- 
ednago, fell  down  bound  in  the  midst  of  the  furnace  of 
burning  fire. 

And  they  walked  in  the  midst  of  the  flame,  praising 
God  and  blessing  the  Lord. 


Great  Holy  Saturday  Morning  913 

Then  Azarias  standing  up  prayed  in  this  manner,  and 
opening  his  mouth  in  the  midst  of  the  fire,  he  said: 

Blessed  art  thou,  O  Lord,  the  God  of  our  fathers,  and 
thy  name  is  worthy  of  praise,  and  glorious  for  ever: 

For  thou  art  just  in  all  that  thou  hast  done  to  us,  and 
all  thy  works  are  true,  and  thy  ways  right,  and  all  thy 
judgments  true. 

For  thou  hast  executed  true  judgments  in  all  the 
things  that  thou  hast  brought  upon  us,  and  upon  Jeru- 
salem the  holy  city  of  our  fathers :  for  acording  to  truth 
and  judgment,  thou  hast  brought  all  these  things  upon 
us  for  our  sins. 

For  we  have  sinned,  and  committed  iniquity,  depart- 
ing from  thee :  and  we  have  trespassed  in  all  things  : 

And  we  have  not  hearkened  to  thy  commandments, 
nor  have  we  observed  nor  done  as  thou  hadst  command- 
ed us,  that  it  might  go  well  with  us. 

Wherefore  all  that  thou  hast  brought  upon  us,  and 
every  thing  that  thou  hast  done  to  us,  thou  hast  done 
in  true  judgment: 

And  thou  hast  delivered  us  into  the  hands  of  our 
enemies  that  are  unjust,  and  most  wicked,  and  prevari- 
cators, and  to  a  king  unjust,  and  most  wicked  beyond  all 
kings  that  are  upon  the  earth. 

And  now  we  cannot  open  our  mouths:  we  are  be- 
come a  shame  and  reproach  to  thy  servants,  and  to  them 
that  worship  thee. 

Deliver  us  not  up  for  ever,  we  beseech  thee,  for  thy 
name's  sake,  and  abolish  not  thy  convenant. 

And  take  not  away  thy  mercy  from  us  for  the  sake 
of  Abraham  thy  beloved,  and  Isaac  thy  servant,  and 
Israel  thy  holy  one: 

To  whom  thou  hast  spoken,  promising  that  thou 
wouldest  multiply  their  seed  as  the  stars  of  heaven,  and 
as  the  sand  that  is  on  the  sea  shore. 

For  we,  O  Lord,  are  diminished  more  than  any  na- 
tion, and  are  brought  low  in  all  the  earth  this  day  for 
our  sins.

Neither  is  there  at  this  time  prince,  or  leader,  or  pro- 
phet, or  holocaust,  or  sacrifice,  or  oblation,  or  incense, 
or  place  of  firstf ruits  before  thee, 

That  we  may  find  thy  mercy:  nevertheless  in  a  con- 
trite heart  and  humble  spirit  let  us  be  accepted. 

As  in  holocausts  of  rams,  and  bullocks,  and  as  in 
thousands  of  fat  lambs:  so  let  our  sacrifice  be  made  in 
thy  sight  this  day,  that  it  may  please  thee:  for  there  is 
no  confusion  to  them  that  trust  in  thee. 

And  now  we  follow  thee  with  all  our  heart,  and  we 
fear  thee,  and  seek  thy  face. 

Put  us  not  to  confusion,  but  deal  with  us  according  to 
thy  meekness,  and  according  to  the  multitude  of  thy 
mercies. 

And  deliver  us  according  to  thy  wonderful  works, 
and  ^ive  glory  to  thy  name.  O  Lord : 

And  let  all  them  be  confounded  that  shew  evils  to  thy 
servants,  let  them  be  confounded  in  all  thy  might,  and 
let  their  strength  be  broken. 

And  let  them  know  that  thou  art  the  Lord,  the  only 
God,  and  glorious  over  all  the  world. 

Now  the  king's  servants  that  had  cast  them  in,  ceased 
not  to  heat  the  furnace  with  brimstone,  and  tow,  and 
pitch,  and  dry  sticks, 

And  the  flame  mounted  up  above  the  furnace  nine 
and  forty  cubits: 

And  it  broke  forth,  and  burnt  such  of  the  Chaldeans 
as  it  found  near  the  furnace. 

But  the  angel  of  the  Lord  went  down  with  Azarias 
and  his  companions  into  the  furnace:  and  he  drove  the 
flame  of  the  fire  out  of  the  furnace. 

And  made  the  midst  of  the  furnace  like  the  blowing 
of  a  wind  brineins:  dew,  and  the  fire  touched  them  not 
at  all,  nor  troubled  them,  nor  did  them  any  harm. 

Then  these  three  as  with  one  mouth  praised,  and 
glorified,  and  blessed  God  in  the  furnace,  saying: 

{Here  the  congregation  kneels.)

Section  from  the  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  the  Romans 

(6:3-11) 

\7E  brethren:  As  many  of  us  as  were  baptized  into 

Jesus  Christ  were  baptized  into  his  death. 

For  we  are  buried  together  with  him  by  baptism  into 

death ;  that  as  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead  by  the  glory 

of  the  Father,  so  we  also  may  walk  in  newness  of  life. 


Great  Holy  Saturday  Morning  917 

For  if  we  have  been  planted  together  in  the  likeness 
of  his  death,  we  shall  be  also  in  the  likeness  of  his  resur- 
rection. 

Knowing  this,  that  our  old  man  is  crucified  with  him, 
that  the  body  of  sin  may  be  destroyed,  to  the  end  that 
we  may  serve  sin  no  longer. 

For  he  that  is  dead  is  justified  from  sin. 

Now  if  we  be  dead  with  Christ,  we  believe  that  we 
shall  live  also  together  with  Christ: 

Knowing  that  Christ  rising  again  from  the  dead, 
dieth  now  no  more,  death  shall  no  more  have  dominion 
over  him. 

For  in  that  he  died  to  sin,  he  died  once;  but  in  that 
he  liveth,  he  liveth  unto  God: 

So  do  you  also  reckon,  that  you  are  dead  to  sin,  but 
alive  unto  God,  in  Christ  Jesus  our  Lord.

inherit  among  all  the  nations. 

1.  God  hath  stood  in  the  congregation  of  gods,  and 
being  in  the  midst  of  them  he  judgeth  gods. 

2.  How  long  will  you  judge  unjustly :  and  accept  the 
persons  of  the  wicked? 

3.  Judge  the  needy  and  fatherless.  Do  justice  to  the 
humble  and  the  poor.

5.  They  have  not  known  nor  understood;  they  walk

918  Passion  Week 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Matthew  (28:1  to  end) 

A  ND  now  in  the  end  of  the  sabbath,  when  it  began 
to  dawn  towards  the  first  day  of  the  week,  came 
Mary  Magdalen  and  the  other  Mary  to  see  the  sepul- 
chre. 

And  behold  there  was  a  great  earthquake.  For  an 
angel  of  the  Lord  descended  from  heaven,  and  coming 
rolled  back  the  stone,  and  sat  upon  it. 

And  his  countenance  was  as  lightning,  and  his  rai- 
ment as  snow. 

And  for  fear  of  him,  the  guards  were  struck  with 
terror,  and  became  as  dead  men. 

And  the  angel  answering,  said  to  the  women:  Fear 
not  you;  for  I  know  that  you  seek  Jesus  who  was  cru- 
cified. 

He  is  not  here,  for  he  is  risen,  as  he  said.  Come,  and 
see  the  place  where  the  Lord  was  laid. 

And  going  quickly,  tell  ye  his  disciples  that  he  is 
risen:  and,  behold,  he  will  go  before  you  into  Galilee: 
there  you  shall  see  him.    Lo,  I  have  foretold  it  to  you. 

And  they  went  out  quickly  from  the  sepulchre  with 
fear  and  great  joy,  running  to  tell  his  disciples. 

And  behold  Jesus  met  them,  saying:  All  hail.  But 
they  came  up  and  took  hold  of  his  feet,  and  adored  him. 

Then  Jesus  said  to  them:  Fear  not.  Go,  tell  my 
brethren  that  they  go  into  Galilee,  there  they  shall  see 
me. 

Who  when  they  were  departed,  behold  some  of  the 
guards  came  into  the  city,  and  told  the  chief  priests  all 
things  that  had  been  done. 

And  they  being  assembled  together  with  the  ancients, 
taking  counsel,  gave  a  great  sum  of  money  to  the  sol- 
diers. 

Saying:  Say  you,  His  disciples  came  by  night,  and 
stole  him  away  when  we  were  asleep. 

And  if  the  governor  shall  hear  of  this,  we  will  per- 
suade him,  and  secure  you. 


Great  Holy  Saturday  Morning  919 

So  they  taking  the  money,  did  as  they  were  taught: 
and  this  word  was  spread  abroad  among  the  Jews  even 
unto  this  day. 

And  the  eleven  disciples  went  into  Galilee,  unto  the 
mountain  where  Jesus  had  appointed  them. 

And  seeing  him  they  adored:  but  some  doubted. 

And  Jesus  coming,  spoke  to  them,  saying:  All  power 
is  given  to  me  in  heaven  and  in  earth. 

Going  therefore,  teach  ye  all  nations:  baptizing  them 
in  the  name  of  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit. 

Teaching  them  to  observe  all  things  whatsoever  I

of  victory  and  triumph. 

Let  us  cleanse  our  senses  that  we  may  behold  Christ 
shining  like  lightning  with  the  unapproachable  light  of 
Resurrection,  that  we  may  hear  him  say  openly,  Re- 
joice! while  we  sing  to  him  the  hymn  of  victory  and 
triumph. 

Let  the  heavens  rejoice,  and  the  earth  be  glad,  as  is

feast;  for  Christ  hath  risen  to  everlasting  joy.

ened. 

Verily,  all  creatures  have  been  filled  with  light,  the

'  I  ^HEY  who  were  with  Mary  came  before  the  dawn, 
found  the  stone  rolled  away  from  the  sepulchre,  and 
heard  the  angels  say  unto  them,  Why  seek  ye  him  as 
man  with  the  dead,  who  dwells  in  light  eternal? 

Behold  the  grave  wrappings;  make  haste  and  declare 
to  the  world  that  the  Lord  is  risen,  and  hath  caused 
death  to  die;  for  he  is  the  Son  of  God,  the  Saviour  of

Fourth  Ode 

T  TPON  the  divine  watchtower  let  the  God-spoken 
^  Habakuk  stand  and  show  us  the  angel  attired  in 
light,  saying  openly.  Today  is  salvation  to  the  world; 
for  Christ  is  risen.  Almighty  as  he  is. 

Verily,  Christ  hath  been  revealed  as  our  Passover; 
for  that  he  was  a  male  opening  a  virginal  womb;  and 
for  that  he  was  Nourishment  he  was  called  a  Lamb ;  and 
for  that  he  is  immaculate  he  was  called  blameless;  and 
for  that  he  is  very  God,  he  is  called  perfect. 

(Christ  who  is  the  crown  of  the  year,  blessed  by  us, 
hath  been  sacrificed  for  us  of  his  free  will,  like  a  year- 
ling lamb,  a  cleansing  Passover.  Then  on  us  the  Sun 
of  righteousness  from  the  tomb  did  shine,  brilliant,  re- 
splendent. 

Before  the  symbolical  ark,  David,  God's  forefather, 
did  leap  and  dance.  Let  us,  therefore,  the  holy  people, 
seeing  the  fulfillment  of  those  symbols,  rejoice  with 
divine  rejoicing;  for  Christ  the  Almighty  is  risen.

O  Christ,  they  who  in  hades'  bonds  are  chained,  see-

feet,  celebrating  an  eternal  passover. 

Let  us,  lamps  in  hand,  come  forth  to  meet  Christ  risen

Sixth  Ode 

/^  CHRIST,  into  the  deepest  abyss  of  earth  thou 
didst  descend,  and  didst  break  the  unyielding  ever- 
lasting bars  which  held  men  prisoner;  and  on  the  third 
day  thou  didst  rise  from  the  tomb  as  Jonah  from  the 
whale. 

O  Christ,  thou  who  didst  not  break  the  locks  of  vir- 
ginity in  thy  birth,  didst  rise  from  the  tomb,  keeping 
its  seals  intact,  and  didst  open  to  us  the  gates  of  paradise. 

O  my  Saviour,  O  thou  living  and  unsacrificed  offer- 
ing, as  thou  art  God,  thou  didst  of  thy  free  will  offer 
thyself  an  offering  to  the  Father.  And  when  thou  didst 
rise  from  the  tomb,  thou  didst  raise  Adam  and  all  his

one  to  another,  Come,  let  us,  O  friends,  anoint  with 
spices  the  life-bearing  body,  now  buried;  the  body  that 
raiseth  fallen  Adam,  lying  in  the  sepulchre.  Come,  let

let  us  offer  of  our  spices  like  unto  their  offerings,  to  him

The  Great  and  Holy  Easter  Sunday 

Synaxarion 

/^N  the  Holy  and  Great  Sunday  of  the  Passover  we 
celebrate  the  life-giving  Resurrection  of  our  Lord 
and  God  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ;  for  Christ  alone  did 
descend  with  condescension  to  fight  hades;  and  he  as- 
cended, bringing  the  abundant  spoils  of  victory  which 
he  had  snatched. 

Mary  the  Magdalene  and  the  rest  of  the  women  (see 
Sunday  of  the  Ointment-Bearing  Women)  who  were 
present  at  the  Saviour's  Burial  on  Friday  evening,  re- 
turned that  very  day  from  Golgotha  to  the  city  and 
prepared  ointment  and  spices,  that  they  might  come 
later  and  anoint  the  body  of  Jesus.  They  rested  the 
next  day,  Saturday,  in  fulfillment  of  the  commandment. 
And  on  the  following  day,  which  was  Sunday  and 
which  the  Evangelists  call  the  first  day  of  the  week, 
which  fell  on  the  twenty-fifth  of  March,  or  thirty-six 
hours  after  the  Death  of  life-giving  Jesus,  the  women 
came  to  the  sepulchre  with  their  prepared  ointments. 
And  as  they  were  pondering  the  difficulty  of  rolling  the 
stone  from  the  gate  of  the  sepulchre,  a  great  earthquake 
took  place,  an  angel  of  the  Lord  came  down,  whose  ap- 


926  Holy  Easter 

pearance  was  like,  lightning  and  his  clothes  like  snow, 
and  rolled  away  the  stone  and  sat  thereon.  The  guards 
trembled  with  fear,  became  like  dead,  and  fled.  But 
the  women  entered  the  sepulchre  and  found  not  Jesus. 
But  they  found  two  other  angels  in  the  form  of  men 
dressed  in  white  raiment  who  proclaimed  to  them  the 
Resurrection  of  the  Saviour,  commanding  them  to  has- 
ten and  give  the  good  news  to  the  Disciples.  In  the 
meantime  Peter  and  John,  who  had  received  the  report 
from  Mary  the  Magdalene  (see  July  twenty-second), 
hastened  and  entered  the  tomb  and  found  there  only  the 
linen  clothes.  They  returned  with  great  joy  to  the  city, 
and  began  to  preach  the  supernatural  Resurrection  of 
Christ,  having  seen  him  alive  in  truth  five  times  that 
very  day. 

For  this  joyful  Resurrection  we  therefore  celebrate 
today,  kissing  one  another  in  Christ  with  the  brotherly 
kiss,  illustrating  thereby  the  dissolution  of  the  enmity 
that  was  between  us  and  God,  and  our  reconciliation 
through  Christ.  This  Feast  was  called  Passover  from 
the  Jewish  name;  for  Christ  by  his  Passion  and  Resur- 
rection translated  us  from  the  curse  of  Adam  and  the 
bondage  of  Satan  to  the  ancient  liberty  and  bliss.  As 
for  the  day  of  the  week,  which  is  called  in  Hebrew,  the 
first  day,  being  dedicated  to  our  Lord  for  his  glorifica- 
tion and  magnification,  it  is  called  in  Greek  Kuriake, 
or  the  Lord's  Day.  The  Disciples  transferred  to  it  the 
dignity  of  the  sabbath  after  the  law  of  the  Old  Testa- 
ment, and  prescribed  that  it  be  a  holiday  and  a  day  of 
rest. 

To  him  be  glory  and  power  for  ever  and  ever.  Amen.

Seventh  Ode 

ILJfE  who  did  save  the  children  from  the  furnace, 
^  ^  when  he  became  Man,  suffered  like  unto  a  mortal, 
and  with  his  sufferings  invested  the  mortal  with  the 


Matins  927 

beauty  of  incorruption,  who  is  the  God  of  our  fathers. 
To  him  alone  be  blessing  and  glory. 

O  Christ,  the  Godly-wise  women  with  their  minds 
did  hasten  with  the  ointment  after  thee.  And  he  whom 
they  sought,  mourning  him  as  dead,  they  now  wor- 
shipped with  joy,  the  living  God.  And  to  the  Disciples 
they  told  the  glad  news  of  thy  mystical  Passover. 

We  celebrate  the  death,  of  death,  the  destruction 
of  hades,  the  first  fruit  of  another  and  endless  life.  And 
as  we  leap  with  joy,  we  praise  the  Cause  of  these  good 
gifts,  the  God  of  our  fathers.  Blessed  and  glorified  be 
he  alone. 

In  truth,  how  noble  is  this  radiant  and  all-festal  night 
of  salvation;  for  it  precedeth  the  proclamation  of  the 
light-b'sarine  day  of  Resurrection,  in  which  the  time-

sea  and  from  the  east,  blessing  the  Christ  in  thee  for 
evermore. 

O  Father  Almighty,  the  Word,  and  the  Spirit,  one 
Nature  in  three  Persons,  God  transcendent  in  Godhead 
and  Essence,  in  thee  have  we  been  baptized,  and  thee  do

promise,  that  thou  shalt  be  with  us  to  the  end  of  time;

tidings  of  the  joy  of  the  Resurrection  of  Christ.  Re- 
joice, O  Jerusalem,  and  leap  for  joy,  in  that  thou  be- 
holdest  Christ  the  King  like  a  bridegroom  come  forth 
from  the  grave. 

So  do  sinners  perish  from  before  the  face  of  God; 
and  the  righteous  rejoicce. 

When  the  ointment-bearing  women  stood,  very  early 
in  the  morning,  before  the  tomb  of  the  Life-giver,  they 


930  Holy  Easter 

found  an  angel  sitting  upon  the  stone.  And  he  cried 
out  unto  them,  saying,  Why  seek  ye  the  Living  among 
the  dead?  Why  mourn  ye  the  Incorruptible  amidst 
corruption?  Go,  proclaim  the  glad  tidings  to  his  Dis- 
ciples. 

This  is  the  day  which  the  Lord  hath  made;  let  us  re- 
joice and  be  glad  therein. 

The  joyful  Passover,  the  Passover  of  the  Lord,  the 
Passover  all  majestic  hath  shone  upon  us!  The  Pass- 
over in  which  we  embrace  one  another  with  joy!  Oh 
what  a  Passover,  delivering  from  sorrow!  For  today 
from  the  tomb,  as  from  a  chamber  Christ  shone,  and 
hath  filled  the  women  with  joy,  saying,  Proclaim  the 
glad  tidings  to  the  Apostles. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

nnODAY  is  the  Day  of  Resurrection!  Let  us  shine 
with  the  Feast!  Let  us  embrace  one  another.  Let 
us  say,  Brethren!  And  because  of  the  Resurrection,  let 
us  forgive  all  things  to  those  who  hate  us,  and  in  this 
wise,  exclaim,  Christ  is  risen  from  the  dead;  by  his 
Death  hath  he  trodden  down  death,  and  on  those  in  the 
tombs  hath  he  bestowed  life. 

^Then  Christ  is  risen,  etc.  {three  times). 

^Note:  In  singing,  Today  is  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  etc.,  the  High 
Priest  or  the  Proto-priest  appeareth,  standing  in  front  of  the  Royal 
Door,  holding  the  holy  Gospel  Book.  Then  all  the  Clergy  and  con- 
gregation come  forward  to  kiss  the  Book  and  shake  hands  with  the 
Priest.  The  congregation  gathered,  then  shake  hands  one  with  ctn- 
other,  One  saith  Christ  is  risen,  while  the  other  answereth.  He  is  risen 
indeed,  And  so  concludeth  the  Matin  Service.

932  Holy  Easter 

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure 
Apostles  (1:1-8) 

T^HE  former  treatise  I  have  made,  O  Theophilus,  of 
all  things  which  Jesus  began  to  do  and  to  teach. 

Until  the  day  on  which,  giving  com.mandments  by  the 
Holy  Spirit  to  the  apostles  whom  he  had  chosen,  he  was 
taken  up : 

To  whom  also  he  shewed  himself  alive  after  his  pas- 
sion, by  many  proofs;  for  forty  days  appearing  to  them, 
and  speaking  of  the  kingdom  of  God. 

And  eating  together  with  them,  he  commanded  them, 
that  they  should  not  depart  from  Jerusalem,  but  should 
wait  for  the  promise  of  the  Father,  which  you  have 
heard  (saith  he)  by  my  mouth. 

For  John  indeed  baptized  with  water:  but  you  shall 
be  baptized  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  not  many  days  hence. 

They,  therefore,  who  were  come  together,  asked  him, 
saying:  Lord,  wilt  thou  at  this  time  restore  again  the 
kingdom  to  Israel? 

But  he  said  to  them:  It  is  not  for  you  to  know  the 
times  or  moments,  which  the  Father  hath  put  in  his 
own  power. 

But  you  shall  receive  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
coming  upon  you,  and  you  shall  be  witnesses  unto  me  in 
Jerusalem,  and  in  all  Tudea,  and  Samaria,  and  even  to 
the  uttermost  part  of  the  earth. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (1:1-17) 

TN  the  beginning  was  the  Word,  and  the  Word  was 

with  God,  and  the  Word  was  God. 

The  same  was  in  the  beginning  with  God. 

All  things  were  made  by  him:  and  without  him  was 
made  nothing  that  was  made. 

In  him  was  life,  and  the  life  was  the  light  of  men. 

And  the  light  shineth  in  darkness,  and  the  darkness 
did  not  comprehend  it. 


The  Mass  933 

There  was  a  man  sent  from  God,  whose  name  was 
John. 

This  man  came  for  a  witness,  to  give  testimony  of 
the  light,  that  all  men  might  believe  through  him. 

He  was  not  the  light,  but  was  to  give  testimony  of 
the  light. 

That  was  the  true  light,  which  enlighteneth  every 
man  that  cometh  into  this  world. 

He  was  in  the  world,  and  the  world  was  made  by 
him,  and  the  world  knew  him  not. 

He  came  unto  his  own,  and  his  own  received  him  not. 

But  as  many  as  received  him,  he  gave  them  power  to 
be  made  the  sons  of  God,  to  them  that  believe  in  his 
name. 

Who  are  born,  not  of  blood,  nor  of  the  will  of  the 
flesh,  nor  of  the  will  of  man,  but  of  God. 

And  the  Word  was  made  flesh,  and  dwelt  among  us, 
(and  we  saw  his  glory,  the  glory  as  it  were  of  the  only 
begotten  of  the  Father,)  full  of  grace  and  truth. 

John  beareth  witness  of  him,  and  crieth  out,  saying: 
This  was  he  of  whom  I  spoke:  He  that  shall  come  after 
me,  is  preferred  before  me:  because  he  was  before  me. 

And  of  his  fulness  we  all  have  received,  and  grace 
for  grace. 

For  the  law  was  given  by  Moses;  grace  and  truth 
came  by  Jesus  Christ. 

^And  the  rest  of  the  Divine  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chrysostom.  And 
on  Especially,  the  Hennos  of  the  Ninth  Ode  is  sung,  with  its  Mag- 
nification,  The  angel  did  speak,  etc.,  and  Shine,  etc. 

Koinonikon  :  Receive  ye  the  Body  of  Christ,  and  taste 
ye  him  that  is  found  deathless. 

^And  instead  of  We  have  seen  the  true  Light,  etc,  and  Blessed  be 
the  Name  of  the  Lord,  etc.  sing,  Christ  is  risen,  etc.  And  after  the 
Benediction  Prayer  is  said,  Christ  is  risen,  etc.  {three  times),  then 
the  Priest  delivereth  the  following  Sermon. 


934  Holy  Easter 

Sermon  of  St.  John  Chrysostom,  Archbishop 
OF  Constantinople 

Deacon:  Bless,  O  Master. 

Priest:  Whosoever  is  a  devout  lover  of  God,  let  him 
enjoy  this  beautiful  bright  Festival.  And  whosoever  is 
a  grateful  servant,  let  him  rejoice  and  enter  into  the  joy 
of  his  Lord.  And  if  any  be  weary  with  fasting,  let  him 
now  receive  his  penny.  If  any  have  toiled  from  the 
first  hour,  let  him  receive  his  due  reward.  If  any 
have  come  after  the  third  hour,  let  him  with  grati- 
tude join  in  the  Feast.  And  he  that  arrived  after 
the  sixth  hour,  let  him  not  doubt;  for  he  too  shall 
sustain  no  loss.  And  if  any  have  delayed  to  the  ninth 
hour,  let  him  not  hesitate,  but  let  him  come  too.  And 
he  that  hath  arrived  only  at  the  eleventh  hour,  let  him 
not  be  afraid  by  reason  of  his  delay;  for  the  Lord  is 
gracious  and  receiveth  the  last  even  as  the  first.  He 
giveth  rest  to  him  that  cometh  at  the  eleventh  hour,  as 
well  as  to  him  that  hath  toiled  from  the  first.  Yea,  to 
this  one  he  giveth  and  upon  that  one  he  bestoweth.  He 
accepteth  works  as  he  greeteth  the  endeavour.  The 
deed  he  honoureth  and  the  intention  he  commendeth. 

Let  all  then  enter  into  the  joy  of  our  Lord.  Ye  first 
and  last  receiving  alike  your  reward;  ye  rich  and  poor, 
rejoice  together.  Ye  sober  and  ye  slothful,  celebrate  the 
day.  Ye  that  have  kept  the  fast  and  ye  that  have  not, 
rejoice  today;  for  the  Table  is  richly  laden.  Fare  ye 
royally  on  it.  The  calf  is  a  fatted  one.  Let  no  one  go 
away  hungry.  Partake  ye  all  of  the  cup  of  faith.  En- 
joy ye  all  the  riches  of  his  goodness.  Let  no  one  grieve 
at  his  poverty;  for  the  universal  kingdom  hath  been 
revealed.  Let  no  one  mourn  that  he  hath  fallen  again 
and  again;  for  forgiveness  hath  risen  from  the  grave. 
Let  no  one  fear  death;  for  the  Death  of  our  Saviour 
hath  set  us  free.  He  hath  destroyed  it  by  enduring  it. 
He  spoiled  hades  when  he  descended  thereto.  He  vexed 
it  even  as  it  tasted  of  his  flesh.    Isaiah  foretold  this  when 


Compline  935 

he  cried,  Thou,  O  hell,  hast  been  vexed  by  encounter- 
ing him  below.  It  is  vexed;  for  it  is  even  done  away 
with.  It  is  vexed;  for  it  is  made  a  mockery.  It  is 
vexed;  for  it  is  destroyed.  It  is  vexed;  for  it  is  annihi- 
lated. It  is  vexed;  for  it  is  now  made  captive.  It  took 
a  body,  and,  lo!  it  discovered  God.  It  took  earth,  and, 
behold,  it  encountered  heaven.  It  took  what  it  saw,  and 
was  overcome  by  what  it  did  not  see.  O  death,  where 
is  thy  sting?  O  hades,  where  is  thy  victory?  Christ  is 
risen  and  thou  art  annihilated.  Christ  is  risen,  and  the 
evil  ones  are  cast  down.  Christ  is  risen,  and  the  angels 
rejoice.  Christ  is  risen,  and  life  is  liberated.  Christ 
is  risen,  and  the  tomb  is  emptied  of  the  dead;  for  Christ, 
having  risen  from  the  dead,  is  become  the  first-fruits  of 
those  that  have  fallen  asleep.  To  him  be  glory  and 
power  for  ever  and  ever.     Amen. 

^And  immediately  the  Troparion  of  the  Saint,  Grace  hath  shone 
forth  etc.  {p.  237) ;  and  after  the  Benediction,  O  thou  who  didst  rise 
from  the  dead,  O  Christ  our  true  God,  etc.,  the  Priest  calleth  out  to 
the  people,  Christ  is  risen,  {three  times);  and  the  people  respond 
Verily,  he  is  risen  {each  time).  Then  the  Priest  finally  saith,  Let  us 
adore  his  third-day  Resurrection.  Amen. 

3.    Prayers  of  Compline  of  Easter 

ilThese  are  said  instead  of  the  Midnight  Prayer,  Prayers  of  the 
Hours,  and  Compline  Prayer,  during  the  entire  New  Week,  in  the 
following  order. 

Priest:   Blessed  be  God,  our  God,  etc. 

Reader:   Christ  is  risen,  etc.  {three  times). 

In  that  we  have  beheld  the  Resurrection  of  Christ, 
etc.  (p.  113). 

They  who  were  with  Mary  did  come  before  the 
dawn,  etc.  (p.  923). 

Though  thou,  O  deathless  One,  didst  descend,  etc. 
(p.  924). 

TN  the  grave  with  the  body,  but  in  hades  with  the  soul, 
in  that  thou  art  God;  in  paradise  with  the  thief,  and 
on  the  throne  with  the  Father  and  the  Spirit,  wast  thou, 
O  Christ,  filling  all  things,  O  infinite  One.

^Then,  Christ  is  risen,  etc;  and  the  Benediction. 

4.   Vesper  Prayer  on  Easter  Sunday 

C^About  the  third  hour  in  the  afternoon,  the  Priest  standeth  before 
the  Holy  Altar  in  vestments,  and  holding  the  censer  in  his  hand,  with 
which  he  maketh  the  sign  of  the  cross,  saying,  Glory  to  the  Holy 
Consubstantial,  etc.,  he  singeth,  Christ  is  risen,  etc.  {three  times), 
from  the  Sanctuary,  and  the  Choir  {six  tirnes)  with  the  Stichoi.  And 
after  the  Sunset  Psalm,  and  the  Great  Synapte,  sing  on  O  Lord,  to 
thee  have  I  cried,  the  first  six  Stichera  of  the  Oktoechos  of  the  Second 
Tone.   {p.  145). 

Glory,  in  the  Second  Tone 

Come,  let  us  all  sing,  etc.  (p.  146). 
Now:    O  Virgin,  verily,  the  shadow  of  the  law,  etc. 
(p.  146). 

ilThen  the  Eisodos  with  the  Gospel,  O  resplendent  Light,  etc;  and 
the  following  Prokeimenon,  in  the  Seventh  Tone. 

Who  is  SO  great  a  God  as  our  God?  Thou  alone  art 
the  God  that  doest  wonders. 


The  New  Week  937 

C^Then  the  Priest  saith,  And  that  we  may  be  worthy,  etc.,  followed 
by  the  reading  of  the  Gospel  in  several  languages. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (20:19-25) 

1.  Now  when  it  was  late  that  same  day,  the  first  of 
the  week,  and  the  doors  were  shut,  where  the  disciples 
were  gathered  together,  for  fear  of  the  Jews,  Jesus 
came  and  stood  in  the  midst,  and  said  to  them :  Peace  be 
to  you. 

2.  And  when  he  had  said  this,  he  showed  them  his 
hands  and  his  side.  The  disciples  therefore  were  glad 
when  they  saw  the  Lord. 

3.  He  said  therefore  to  them  again :  Peace  be  to  you. 
As  the  Father  hath  sent  me,  I  also  send  you. 

When  he  had  said  this,  he  breathed  on  them;  and  he 
said  to  them :  Receive  ye  the  Holy  Ghost. 

Whose  sins  you  shall  forgive,  they  are  forgiven  them ; 
and  whose  sins  you  shall  retain,  they  are  retained. 

4.  Now  Thomas,  one  of  the  twelve,  who  is  called 
Didymus,  was  not  with  them  when  Jesus  came. 

The  other  disciples  therefore  said  to  him:  We  have 
seen  the  Lord. 

5.  But  he  said  to  them:  Except  I  shall  see  in  his 
hands  the  print  of  the  nails,  and  put  my  finger  into  the 
place  of  the  nails,  and  put  my  hand  into  his  side,  I  will 
not  believe. 

^Then  the  Petitions,  Let  us  all  say,  etc;  Vouchsafe,  O  Lord,  etc; 
and  Let  us  finish  our  evening  petitions,  etc.  (pp.  76-77)  And  after 
the  Exclamation,  sing  the  first  Sticheron  from  the  Aposticha  of  the 
Second  Tone,  Thy  Resurrection,  O  Christ,  etc.  {p.  146);  and  the 
Easter  Stichera  with  their  Stichoi  (p.  929).  Glory  and  Now,  Today 
is  the  day  of  Resurrection,  etc;  Christ  is  risen,  etc.  and  the  Benedic- 
tion. 

The  New  Week 

CThe  characteristics  of  the  New  Week,  which  falleth  between  Easter 
Sunday  and  the  night  of  the  Saturday  preceding  Thomas  Sunday,  are, 
first:  The  Service  of  Easter  itself  is  observed  therein,  both  Vespers 
and  Matins,  with  the  difference  that  the  Stichera  of  the  Resurrection 
Tones  are  sung  in  it  consecutively,  i.e.,  the  Second  Tone  for  Monday, 


938  The  New  Week 

the  Third  Tone  for  Tuesday,  etc.  Second:  The  three  Doors  of  the 
Temple,  the  Northern,  Southern,  and  Royal  Doors,  are  kept  open  un~ 
til  Saturday  evening,  when  they  are  closed.  This  is  to  indicate  that 
Christ  by  his  Resurrection  from  the  dead  hath  opened  for  us  the 
doors  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  Third:  It  is  permitted  to  eat  meat 
on  all  days  of  this  week,  which  is  considered  as  one  continuous  day  of 
rejoicing.  But  during  the  remaining  weeks  to  Pentecost  Sunday,  it 
is  permitted  to  eat  fish  on  Wednesday  and  Friday. 

Friday  of  the  New  Week 

On  which  is  chanted  the  Service  of  the  Life-Receiving 
Fountain  of  the  Theotokos 

Synaxarion 

/^UTSIDE  the  city  of  Constantinople,  in  the  suburb 
known  as  the  Seven  Towers,  there  was  a  very  beau- 
tiful church  called  after  the  name  of  the  exalted  Theo- 
tokos. It  was  built  in  the  middle  of  the  fifth  century 
by  King  Leo  Thrax,  who  was  also  styled  Makelles  (or 
Butcher).  The  church  was  situated  near  a  spring  of 
water  which  accomplished  many  miracles  at  various 
times,  healing  diseases  by  the  grace  of  the  Theotokos. 
Hence  it  was  called  Life-Giving.  The  Church  of 
Christ,  therefore,  celebrates  today  the  consecration  of 
this  church,  which,  after  the  fall  of  the  empire,  was 
pulled  down  by  edict,  and  the  stones  from  its  ruins  were 
used  in  building  the  mosque  named  after  Sultan  Baya- 
zid.  There  remained  in  the  place  of  the  beautiful  old 
church  only  a  small,  mean,  subterranean  one  covered  by 
debris,  to  which  one  descended  by  twenty-five  steps,  and 
lighted  faintly  by  lamps  in  the  ceiling.  The  spring  of 
holy  water  was  close  to  the  church  on  its  western  side, 
surrounded  by  an  iron  railing,  through  which  one  could 
see  a  few  fish  swimming.  This  condition  remained  till 
the  year  1821,  when  the  church  was  completely  demol- 
ished, and  the  spring  sank  into  the  ground  and  disap- 
peared without  a  trace. 

However,  in  the  resplendent  days  of  Sultan  Mah- 
moud  when  his  Ottoman  subjects  were  accorded  relig- 


Thomas  Sunday  939 

ious  freedom,  the  Orthodox  sought  permission  to  build 
at  least  the  little  church.  On  the  twenty-seventh  of  July, 
1833,  work  began  on  the  construction  of  the  Small 
Spring  Church,  which  was  restored,  more  beautiful 
than  ever,  then,  when  a  second  sultanic  permission  was 
received,  a  very  beautiful  and  large  church  was  built  on 
the  foundations  of  the  first.  The  construction  began  on 
the  fourteenth  of  September  of  the  year  1833,  and  it 
was  finished  on  the  thirteenth  of  December^  1834.  And 
on  the  second  of  February,  Patriarch  Costandios  II  of 
Constantinople,  with  twelve  archbishops,  consecrated 
the  church  with  a  great  ecclesiastical  celebration,  which 
was  witnessed  by  a  great  crowd  of  Christians,  for  the 
glorification  of  the  Theotokos,  and  the  pride  of  the 
Orthodox  Church. 

By  the  intercession  of  thy  pure  Mother,  O  Christ  our 
God,  have  mercy  upon  us.    Amen.

940  Pentecostarion 

TNTO  the  gathering  of  the  Disciples  while  the  doors 

were  shut,  thou  didst  suddenly  enter,  O  Jesus  our 
Almighty  God.  And  standing  in  their  midst,  thou 
didst  grant  them  peace,  and  filled  them  with  a  holy 
spirit,  commanding  them  to  tarry  and  not  depart  from 
Jerusalem  until  they  were  vested  with  power  from 
above.  Wherefore,  O  our  Light,  Resurrection,  and 
Peace,  we  cry  unto  thee,  glory  to  thee.     {Repeat.) 

Eight  days  after  thy  Resurrection,  O  Lord,  thou 
didst  appear  to  thy  Disciples  in  the  place  where  they 
were  gathered,  and  cried  unto  them.  Peace  unto  you, 
showing  thy  hands  and  pure  side  to  the  doubting  Dis- 
ciple. Having,  therefore,  believed,  he  shouted  unto 
thee,  My  Lord  and  my  God,  glory  to  thee.     {Repeat.) 

O  good  Christ,  when  thou  enteredst  unto  thy  Dis- 
ciples, the  doors  being  shut,  Thomas,  who  was  called 
Didymus,  was  not  with  them.  Wherefore,  he  doubted 
what  was  told  him.  Albeit,  thou  didst  not  deem  him 
unworthy  for  his  lack  of  faith,  rather  assuring  him  of 
faith,  by  showing  him  thy  pure  side,  and  the  wounds 
in  thy  hands  and  feet.  Therefore,  having  sought  and 
beheld,  he  confessed  that  thou  art  an  unabstract  God, 
and  an  unsimple  Man,  crying.  My  Lord  and  my  God, 
glory  to  thee.      {Repeat.) 

The  Disciples,  being  doubtful,  the  Saviour,  after 
eight  days,  came  to  where  they  were  gathered  and 
granted  them  peace.  Then  he  cried  unto  Thomas, 
Come,  O  Apostle,  and  probe  the  two  palms  which 
were  pierced  by  the  nails.  O  the  delicacy  of  the  beau- 
tiful unbelief  of  Thomas,  as  coming  with  the  heart  of 
an  unbeliever  to  knowledge,  he  called  out  with  fear, 
My  Lord  and  my  God,  glory  to  thee.     {Repeat.) 

In  the  Second  Tone 

A  FTER  thy  Resurrection,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  stand 
in  the  midst  of  thy  Disciples,  as  they  were  gath- 
ered together,  the  doors  being  shut,  and  bestowed  peace 
on  them.     As  for  Thomas,  having  been  convinced  by 


Thomas  Sunday  941 

beholding  thy  hands  and  side,  he  confessed  that  thou 
art  Lord,  God,  and  Saviour  of  those  who  put  their 
trust  in  thee,  O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Verily,  Jesus  approached  the  Disciples,  the  doors 
being  shut,  and  granted  them  safety  and  the  passing 
away  of  fear.  Then  he  pointed  to  Thomas  and  said, 
Why  believest  thou  not  in  my  Resurrection  from  the 
dead?  Reach  hither  thy  hand  and  thrust  it  into  my 
side.  See  and  know;  for  thy  lack  of  faith  shall  teach 
every  one  my  Passion  and  Resurrection,  and  they  shall 
all  shout  with  thee.  My  Lord  and  my  God,  glory  to 
thee. 


Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

'  I  ^HOU  didst  come  to  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ,  the 
doors  being  shut,  but  through  design  thou  didst 
not  find  Thomas  with  them;  for  he  said,  I  will  not 
believe  until  I  behold  the  Master,  view  the  side  from 
which  blood  and  water  issued  for  baptism,  observe  the 
wound  through  which  he  healed  man  from  the  great 
wound,  and  see  that  he  is  not  a  ghost,  but  of  body  and 
bones.  Wherefore,  O  thou  who  didst  tread  down 
death  and  convinced  Thomas,  O  Lord,  glory  to  thee. 

^And  in  the  Aposticha,  the  following  Stichera,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

'XX/'HAT  miraculous  wonder,  that  lack  of  faith  be- 
came conviction  of  faith;  for  Thomas  exclaimed, 
Unless  I  see,  I  will  not  believe.  Wherefore,  when  he 
searched  the  side  he  spoke  of  the  Godhead  of  the  In- 
carnate, who  is  Son  of  God,  and  knew  that  he  verily 
did  sufifer  in  the  flesh,  and  thus  cried  proclaiming  the 
Risen  God,  shouting  in  a  loud  voice,  My  Lord  and 
my  God,  glory  to  thee. 

Sticho':  Praise  the  Lord,  O  Jerusalem,  Praise  thy 
God,  O  Zion. 

What  miraculous  wonder,  that  grass  should  touch 
fire  and  be  safe:  for  Thomas  cast  his  hand  into  the  fire 
of  the  side  of  Jesus  Christ  God,  and  was  not  consumed 


942  Pentecostarion 

by  touching  him.  Verily,  the  obstinate  soul  turned 
with  fervour  to  true  faith,  and  he  shouted  from  the 
depth  of  his  spirit.  Thou  art  my  Master  and  my  God 
who  didst  rise  from  the  dead.     Glory  to  thee. 

Stichos:  Because  he  hath  strengthened  the  bolts  of 
thy  gates,  he  hath  blessed  thy  children  within  thee. 

What  miraculous  wonder!  John  did  lean  against 
the  World's  bosom,  yet  Thomas  was  made  worthy  to 
probe  his  side.  Albeit,  that  one  drew  therefrom  the 
depth  of  theology  and  dread  dispensation;  this  one 
was  privileged  to  announce  to  us  openly,  and  reveal 
the  mystery  of  his  Resurrection,  crying,  My  Lord  and 
my  God,  glory  to  thee. 

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

TTOW  great  is  the  multitude  of  thine  infinite  com- 
'*'  ^  passion,  O  Lover  of  mankind;  for  because  of  thy 
long-sufifering  thou  wast  struck  by  the  Jews,  wast  ex- 
amined by  an  Apostle,  and  deeply  probed  by  those 
who  denied  thee.  How  wast  thou  incarnated?  How 
wast  thou  crucified,  O  thou  who  hast  not  possessed  sin? 
Albeit,  make  us  understand,  as  Thomas,  that  we  may 
call  out  to  thee.  My  Lord  and  my  God,  glory  to  thee. 

Troparion,  in  the  Seventh  Tone  (three  times) 

TX/'HILE  the  tomb  was  sealed,  thou  didst  shine  forth 
from  it,  O  Light.  While  the  doors  were  closed, 
thou  didst  come  in  to  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ  God, 
Resurrection  of  all,  renewing  in  us  through  them  an 
upright  spirit,  according  to  the  greatness  of  thy  mercy. 

2.    Matins 

Kathismata,  in   the  First   Tone 

A  S  the  Disciples  were  gathered  in  the  upper  cham- 
^^  ber  of  Zion,  for  fear  of  the  Jews,  thou  didst  enter 
unto  them,  O  good  One.  Thou  didst  stand  in  their 
midst,  the  doors  being  shut,  and  filled  them  with  joy 


Thomas  Sunday  943 

when  thou  didst  show  them  the  wounds  of  thy  hands 
and  unpolluted  side,  saying  unto  the  doubting  Dis- 
ciple, Reach  out  thy  hand,  examine,  probe,  that  I  am 
he  who  suffered  for  thy  sake. 

Thou  didst  stand  in  the  midst  of  the  Disciples,  the 
doors  being  shut,  O  Christ,  Life  of  all,  and  showed 
them  thy  side,  hands,  and  feet  together,  a  prelude  to 
belief  in  thy  Resurrection  from  the  tomb.  But  Thomas 
happened  not  to  be  there.  Therefore,  spake  he,  saying 
If  I  see  not  with  mine  own  eyes,  I  w^ill  not  be  con- 
vinced by  your  words. 

When  the  Lord  rose  from  the  tomb  and  appeared 
ineffably  to  the  Disciples,  he  said,  Having  seen,  O 
Thomas,  my  side  and  the  prints  of  the  nails  w^hy  be- 
lievest  thou  not  in  my  Resurrection?  But  Didymus, 
being  convinced,  called  out  to  the  Creator,  saying, 
Thou  art  verily  my  Lord  and  my  God. 

4I^Then  the  Anabathmoi,  From  my  youth,  etc.  {p.  50) ;  and  the  fol- 
lowing Prokeimenon.

gates,  he  hath  blessed  thy  children  within  thee.

O  most  radiant  lamp,  the  Theotokos,  the  immeasur- 
able honour,  which  is  more  exalted  than  all  creatures, 
with  praises  do  we  magnify  thee. 

On  thy  all-radiant  day,  most  resplendent  with  the 
light  of  grace,  O  Christ,  in  which  thou  didst  appear  in 
the  comeliness  of  beauty  to  thy  Disciples,  with  praises 
do  we  magnify  thee. 

O  thou  whose  side  was  probed  and  touched  with  the 
earthly  palm,  not  burned  by  the  fire  of  thine  imma- 
terial Divinity,  w^ith  praises  do  we  magnify  thee. 

O  Christ,  who  didst  rise  from  the  tomb,  being  God, 
though  we  have  not  beheld  thee,  yet  have  we  with

eager  hearts  believed  in  thee,  and  with  songs  of  praise 
do  we  magnify  thee.

Exapostetlarions 

T>  E  not  faithless,  O  Thomas,  to  me  who  was  wounded 
for  thy  sake.    And  having  probed  my  wounds  with 
thy  hands,  be  of  one  mind  with  the  Disciples,  and  pro- 
claim I  am  a  living  God.     (Repeat.) 

Today  the  fragrance  of  spring  is  shed  forth,  and  the 
new  creation  shall  rejoice.  Today  the  locks  shall  be 
lifted  from  the  doors  with  the  faithlessness  of  the  be- 
loved Thomas,  as  he  shouteth  out.  Thou  art  my  Lord 
and  my  God. 

CIn  the  Einos,  four  Prosomia  for  Thomas,  in  the  First  Tone. 

A  S  thou  didst  not  break  the  seals  of  the  tomb  at  thy 
dread  Resurrection,  O  life-giving  Christ,  so  didst 
thou  enter  unto  thy  glorious  Apostles,  the  doors  being 
shut,  and  made  them  glad.  And  at  once  thou  didst  be- 
stow on  them  an  upright  spirit,  for  thy  countless  mer- 
cies.    {Repeat.) 

When  thou  appeared  among  thy  Disciples,  O  Lord, 
Thomas,  who  is  called  Didymus,  was  not  there.  There- 
fore, he  doubted  the  fact  of  thy  Resurrection,  and  unto 
those  who  had  seen  thee  he  cried,  saying.  Except  I 
thrust  my  hand  into  his  side,  in  the  prints  of  the  nails, 
I  will  not  believe  that  he  is  risen. 

Verily,  Christ  called  unto  Thomas,  saying,  Probe 
as  thou  wilt;  thrust  in  thy  hand  and  know  me,  that  I 
have  earthly  flesh,  bones,  and  body.  Be  not  doubtful, 
but  believe  as  the  rest.  But  that  one  shouted,  crying. 
Glory  to  thy  Resurrection,  O  thou  who  art  my  Lord 
and  my  God.

Glory  and  Now,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

JPIGHT  days  after  thy  Resurrection,  O  Jesus,  King, 
the  Word,  and  only  Son  of  the  Father,  thou  didst 
appear  to  thy  Disciples,  the  doors  being  shut,  granting 
them  thy  peace.  And  to  the  Disciple  who  believed 
not  thou  didst  show  the  marks,  saying,  Reach  out  and 
probe  my  hands,  feet,  and  incorruptible  side.  But  he, 
being  convinced,  cried  out  unto  thee,  saying.  My  Lord 
and  my  God,  glory  to  thee.

Thomas;  and  the  following  Kontakion,  in  the  Eighth  Tone. 

\\T1TH  his  anxiously  searching  right  hand,  O 
Christ  God,  Thomas  did  probe  thy  life-giving 
side;  for  when  thou  didst  enter,  the  doors  being  shut, 
he  shouted  with  the  rest  of  the  Disciples,  crying,  Thou 
art  my  Lord  and  my  God. 

4lThen  conclude  with  the  Kontakion,  Though  thou.  O  deathless 
One,  etc.  {p.  924). 

The  Epistle:  Great  God  is  our  Lord  and  of  great 
power.     Praise  ye  the  Lord;  for  he  is  good. 

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure 
Apostles  (5:12-20) 

TN  those  days :  By  the  hands  of  the  apostles  were  many 
■^  signs  and  wonders  wrought  among  the  people;  (and 
they  were  all  with  one  accord  in  Solomon's  porch). 

And  of  the  rest  durst  no  man  join  himself  unto 
them;  but  the  people  magnified  them. 

And  the  multitude  of  men  and  women  who  believed 
in  the  Lord,  was  now  increased: 

Insomuch  that  they  brought  forth  the  sick  into  the 
streets,  and  laid  them  on  beds  and  couches,  that  when 
Peter  came,  his  shadow  at  the  least,  might  overshadow 
any  of  them,  and  they  might  be  delivered  from  their 
infirmities, 


946  Pentecostarion 

And  there  came  also  together  to  Jerusalem  a  multi- 
tude out  of  the  neighbouring  cities,  bringing  sick  per- 
sons, and  such  as  were  troubled  with  unclean  spirits; 
who  were  all  healed. 

Then  the  high  priest  rising  up,  and  all  they  that 
were  with  him,  (which  is  the  heresy  of  the  Sadducees,) 
were  filled  with  envy. 

And  they  laid  hands  on  the  apostles,  and  put  them 
in  the  common  prison. 

But  an  angel  of  the  Lord  by  night  opening  the  doors 
of  the  prison,  and  leadins;  them  out,  said 

Go,  stand  and  sneak  in  the  temple  to  the  people  all 
the  words  of  this  life.

Synaxarion 

A  S  the  Disciples  were  gathered  together  on  the  Sun- 
day following  the  Resurrection,  in  a  room  with  the 
doors  closed,  Jesus  entered  miraculously,  and,  ,standing 
in  their  midst,  greeted  them  in  his  usual  way,  saying, 
Peace  be  unto  you :  and  he  showed  them  his  hands,  feet, 
and  side.  Then,  taking  some  broiled  fish  and  honey,  he 
ate  before  them,  and  thus  assured  them  of  his  Resurrec- 
tion. But  Thomas,  who  was  not  then  with  the  Disciples, 
believed  not  their  testimony  concerning  Christ's  Resur- 
rection, but  said  positively,  Unless  I  see  the  print  of  the 
nails  in  his  hands  and  of  the  spear  in  his  side  I  will  not 
believe.  Eight  days  after,  on  the  day  corresponding  to 
this  one,  as  the  Disciples  were  gathered  together,  and 
Thomas  with  them,  Jesus  came,  while  the  doors  were 
locked,  as  at  the  first  time.     He  stood  in  their  midst 


Sunday  of  Ointment-Bearers  947 

and  said,  Peace  be  unto  you.  Then  to  Thomas,  Reach 
hither  thy  hand,  and  thrust  it  into  my  side;  and  be  not 
faithless,  but  believing. 

And  when  Thomas  beheld  the  Master's  hands  and 
side,  he  cried  out  in  faith,  My  Lord  and  my  God,  thus 
clearly  illustrating  the  two  Natures  of  Christ,  the 
human  and  the  divine.  (St.  Luke  24:36-43  and  St.  John 
20:19-28.)

Sunday  of  the  Olntment-Bearers 

€[,0n  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  the  Stichera  of  the  Resurrection 
of  the  Second  Tone;  and  the  following  three  for  the  Ointment-bear- 
ers in  the  Same  Tone. 

C"  ARLY,  at  dawn,  the  ointment-bearing  women  arose, 
^-^  and  carrying  ointments,  came  to  the  Lord's  tomb. 
And  not  attaining  their  desire,  the  pious  women  pon- 
dered the  removal  of  the  stone,  addressing  one  another 
and  saying,  Where  are  the  seals  of  the  grave?  Where 
are  Pilate's  watchmen  and  the  security  of  his  great  care? 
And  lo,  an  angel,  radiant  as  lightning,  proclaimed  to 
them  that  of  which  they  were  ignorant,  addressing  them 
and  saying,  Why,  wailing,  seek  ye  the  Living  who  pro- 
duceth  life  for  mankind?  Christ  our  God  hath  risen 
from  the  dead,  since  he  is  Almighty,  bestowing  on  all, 
life,  incorruptibility,,  illumination,  and  the  Great 
Mercy. 

Why  mingle  ye  tears  with  the  ointment,  O  women 
Disciples?  Behold,  the  stone  hath  been  rolled  away, 
and  the  sepulchre  is  empty.  Behold  corruption  trodden 
under  of  Life,  the  seals  bearing  clear  witness,  the  guards 
of  the  rebellious  fast  asleep,  the  dead  saved  by  the  body 
of  God,  and  hades  mourning.    Hasten  ye  with  joy,  and 


948  Pentecostarion 

tell  the  Disciples  that  Christ,  who  is  First-born  of  the 
dead,  who  caused  death  to  die,  shall  go  before  you  into 
Galilee. 

The  ointment-bearers,  O  Christ,  rose  up  early  and 
hastened  to  thy  tomb,  seeking  to  anoint  with  oils  thine 
incorruptible  body.  But  when  the  glad  tidings  were 
brought  to  them  by  the  words  of  the  angel,  with  signs 
of  joy  they  proclaimed  to  the  Apostles  that  the  Element 
of  our  salvation  had  risen,  leading  death  captive,  and 
granting  the  world  life  eternal  and  the  Great  Mercy. 

Glory,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

T^HE  ointment-bearing  women,  O  Saviour,  came  to 
thy  tomb;  and  when  they  beheld  the  seals,  not  find- 
ing thy  body,  they  hurried  anxiously,  wailing  and  say- 
ing. Who  hath  stolen  our  Hope?  Who  hath  taken  away 
a  naked,  embalmed  corpse,  the  only  consolation  to  his 
Mother?  Woe!  how  hath  the  dead-reviving  One  died? 
And  how  was  he  buried  who  spoiled  hades?  But  arise 
thou,  by  thine  own  power  after  three  days,  as  thou  didst 
say,  and  save  our  souls. 

C^And  Now,  O  Virgin,  verily,  the  shadow  of  the  law,  etc.   {p. 146). 

^And  in  the  Aposticha,  the  First  Sticheron  of  the  Second  Tone  for 
the  Resurrection,  Thy  Resurrection.  O  Christ  Savior,  etc.  (p.  146),

robe,  etc.  (p.  881);  and  Now,  Today  is  the  Day  of  Resurrection, 
etc.  (p.  930).  Then  the  Troparia,  in  the  Second  Tone. 

When  thou,  O  immortal  life,  etc.  (p.  147). 

TPHE  pious  Joseph,  having  brought  down  thy  pure 
body  from  the  Tree,  wrapped  it  in  fine  linen,  em- 
balmed it  with  ointment,  provided  for  it,  and  laid  it  in 
a  new  tomb.  But  thou  didst  verily  rise,  after  three  days, 
O  Lord,  granting  the  world  the  Great  Mercy. 

Verily,  the  angel  came  to  the  tomb  and  said  to  the 
ointment-bearing  women.  The  ointment  is  meet  for  the 
dead,  but  Christ  is  shown  to  be  remote  from  corrup- 
tion. But  cry  ye.  The  Lord  is  risen,  granting  the  world 
the  Great  Mercy.

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure 
Apostles  (6:1-7) 

TN  those  days,  the  number  of  the  disciples  increasing, 
there  arose  a  murmuring  of  the  Greeks  against  the 
Hebrews,  for  that  their  widows  were  neglected  in  the 
daily  ministrations. 


950  Pentecostarion 

Then  the  twelve  calling  together  the  multitude  of  the 
disciples,  said:  It  is  not  reason  that  we  should  leave  the 
word  of  God,  and  serve  tables. 

Wherefore,  brethren,  look  ye  out  among  you  seven 
men  of  good  reputation,  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  wis- 
dom, whom  we  may  appoint  over  this  business. 

But  we  will  give  ourselves  continually  to  prayer,  and 
to  the  ministry  of  the  word. 

And  the  saying  was  liked  by  all  the  multitude.  And 
they  chose  Stephen,  a  man  full  of  faith,  and  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  and  Philip,  and  Prochorus,  and  Nicanor,  and 
Timon,  and  Parmenas,  and  Nicolas,  a  proselyte  of 
Antioch. 

These  they  set  before  the  apostles;  and  they  praying, 
imposed  hands  upon  them. 

And  the  word  of  the  Lord  increased;  and  the  number 
of  the  disciples  was  multiplied  in  Jerusalem  exceeding- 
ly: a  great  multitude  also  of  the  priests  obeyed  the  faith. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  Mark  (15:43  to  end;  16:1-8) 

AT  that  time:  Joseph  of  Arimathea,  a  noble  coun- 
sellor,  who  was  also  himself  looking  for  the  king- 
dom of  God,  came  and  went  in  boldly  to  Pilate,  and 
begged  the  body  of  Jesus. 

But  Pilate  wondered  that  he  should  be  already  dead, 
and  sending  for  the  centurion,  he  asked  him  if  he  were 
already  dead. 

And  when  he  had  understood  it  by  the  centurion,  he 
gave  the  body  to  Joseph. 

And  Joseph,  buying  fine  linen,  and  taking  him  down, 
wrapped  him  up  in  the  fine  linen,  and  laid  him  in  a 
sepulchre  which  was  hewed  out  of  a  rock.  And  he 
rolled  a  stone  to  the  door  of  the  sepulchre. 

And  Mary  Magdalen,  and  Mary  the  mother  of 
Joses,  beheld  where  he  was  laid. 

And  when  the  sabbath  was  past,  Mary  Magdalen, 
and  Mary  the  mother  of  James,  and  Salome,  brought 
sweet  spices,  that  coming  they  might  anoint  Jesus. 


Sunday  of  Ointment-Bearers  951 

And  very  early  in  the  morning,  the  first  day  of  the 
week,  they  came  to  the  sepulchre,  the  sun  being  now 
risen. 

And  they  said  one  to  another:  Who  shall  roll  us  back 
the  stone  from  the  door  of  the  sepulchre? 

And  looking,  they  saw  the  stone  rolled  back.  For  it 
was  very  great. 

And  entering  into  the  sepulchre,  they  saw  a  young 
man  sitting  on  the  right  side,  clothed  with  a  white  robe : 
and  they  were  astonished. 

Who  saith  to  them;  Be  not  affrighted;  you  seek  Jesus 
of  Nazareth,  who  was  crucified:  he  is  risen,  he  is  not 
here,  behold  the  place  where  they  laid  him. 

But  go,  tell  his  disciples  and  Peter  that  he  goeth  be- 
fore you  into  Galilee;  there  you  shall  see  him,  as  he 
told  you. 

But  they  going  out,  fled  from  the  sepulchre.  For  a 
trembling  and  fear  had  seized  them :  and  they  said  noth- 
ing to  any  man ;  for  they  were  afraid

Synaxarion 

AT  the  beginning  of  the  year  32  Jesus  frequently 
"^^  came  to  Galilee,  preaching  and  performing  mir- 
acles. Many  women  then  left  their  homes  and  followed 
him,  ministering  unto  him  out  of  their  own  means,  even 
when  he  was  on  the  Cross  and  in  the  sepulchre.  Finally, 
they  went  with  ointment,  which  they  had  prepared  to 
anoint  his  body  (see  Easter  Sunday).  And  from  this 
they  were  called  ointment-bearing  women.  We  know 
the  names  of  only  seven  of  these.  They  are  those  named 
Mary  the  Magdalene  (see  July  twenty-second),  Mary 
the  mother  of  James  and  Joses,  the  wife  of  Cleophas, 
Joanna  the  wife  of  Chuza,  Herod  Antipas'  steward, 
Salome  the  mother  of  the  sons  of  Zebedee,  and  Sus- 
anna (St.  Mt.  27:56;  St.  Lk.  8:2-3;  and  St.  Jn.  19:25), 


952  Pentecostarion 

and  Mary  and  Martha,  the  sisters  of  Lazarus.  As  for 
the  rest,  the  Evangelists  are  silent  concerning  their 
names. 

Along  with  these  we  celebrate  also  in  honour  of  Jo- 
seph and  Nicodemus,  who  were  two  Disciples  of  Christ, 
secretly  at  the  beginning.  It  is  probable  that  Nico- 
demus was  a  Jerusalemite,  one  of  the  leaders  of  the 
Jews,  of  the  sect  of  Pharisees,  versed  in  the  law  and  the 
Holy  Scriptures.  Early  in  the  preaching  of  salvation, 
Nicodemus  believed  in  Christ,  having  come  to  him  at 
night  (St.  Jn.  3  :1-21).  And  at  his  Burial  also  he  came 
carrying  a  mixture  of  myrrh  and  aloes,  a  hundred  menas 
in  weight,  or  a  hundred  pounds,  for  the  purpose  of 
scenting  and  embalming,  and  as  a  gesture  of  reverence 
and  love  to  the  divine  Master.  Joseph,  on  the  other 
hand,  was  a  rich  and  noble  man  of  the  city  of  Ramah, 
or  Arimathea,  and  one  of  the  Privy  Council  of  Jeru- 
salem. At  the  death  of  Jesus  he  ventured  to  approach 
Pilate  and  ask  for  the  undefiled  body  of  Christ,  and  he 
and  Nicodemus  accompanied  it  to  the  sepulchre  and 
buried  it  there.  It  was  said  that  the  garden  where  Jesus 
was  buried  was  one  of  the  possessions  of  Joseph,  and 
that  he  had  prepared  therein  a  tomb  for  himself,  hewed 
in  the  rock.  As  time  did  not  permit  the  digging  out  of 
another  tomb  and  preparing  it,  he  placed  the  body  of 
Jesus  in  his  own  tomb.  That  seems  to  be  the  meaning 
of  Matthew  the  Evangelist  when  he  says.  And  laid  it  in 
his  own  tomb,  which  he  had  hewn  out  in  the  rock.  (St. 
Mt.  27:60).

1 .   Vespers 

CO/i  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  seven  Stichera  for  the  Resurrec- 
tion, in  the  Third  Tone;  and  the  following  three  for  the  Paralytic, 
in  the  First  Tone. 


Sunday  of  the  Paralytic  953 

/^  CHRIST  God,  the  Compassionate,  who  by  thy 
^^  pure  palm  didst  create  man,  thou  didst  come  to 
heal  the  sick.  By  thy  word  thou  didst  make  the  para- 
lytic to  stand  in  the  sheep's  pool  of  blood.  Upon  the 
son  of  the  Canaanitish  woman  thou  didst  have  mercy, 
and  the  request  of  the  centurion  thou  didst  not  deny. 
Wherefore,  we  cry  unto  thee,  O  Almighty  Lord,  glory 
to  thee.     (Repeat.) 

The  paralytic,  who  was  like  unto  a  dead  man  un- 
buried,  having  seen  thee,  O  Lord,  cried  out.  Have 
mercy  upon  me;  for  my  bed  hath  become  my  grave.  Of 
what  use  is  my  life?  I  have  no  need  for  the  sheep's 
pool;  for  there  is  none  to  put  me  into  the  pool.  Albeit, 
I  come  to  thee,  O  Fountain  of  all  healing,  that,  with  all 
I  may  cry  unto  thee.  Lord  Almighty,  glory  be  to  thee. 


Glory,  in  the  Fifth  Tone 

JESUS  went  up  to  Jerusalem,  to  the  sheep's  pool 
which  in  Hebrew  was  called  Bethesda,  having  five 
porches.  And  there  lay  a  great  multitude  of  the  sick; 
for  the  angel  of  the  Lord  went  down  at  certain  seasons 
and  moved  the  water,  granting  healing  to  those  who 
approached  in  faith.  And  the  Lord  saw  there  a  man 
with  a  chronic  disease,  and  he  said  unto  him,  Wilt  thou 
be  made  whole?  And  the  sick  man  replied,  I  have  no 
man,  when  the  water  is  moved,  to  put  me  into  the  pool. 
I  have  wasted  my  money  on  physicians  and  received 
no  help  from  any  one.  But  the  physician  of  soul  and 
body  said  unto  him,  Take  up  thy  bed  and  walk,  pro- 
claiming through  the  regions  my  might  and  the  great- 
ness of  my  mercy.

TN  Solomon's  porch  many  sick  were  lying.  But  in  the 
midst  of  the  Feast  Christ  found  there  a  paralytic 
who  had  been  impotent  for  thirty-eight  years.  To  him 
he  called  out  in  a  lordly  tone,  Wilt  thou  be  whole?  And 
the  infirm  replied,  Lord,  I  have  no  man,  when  the 
water  is  moved,  to  put  me  into  the  pool.  And  the  Lord 
said  unto  him,  Take  up  thy  bed.  Behold  thou  hast  be- 
come whole,  sin  not  again.  Wherefore,  O  Lord,  by  the 
intercessions  of  the  Theotokos,  send  us  thy  Great  Mercy.

nPHE  paralytic  was  not  healed  by  the  pool;  but  the 
word  renewed  him;  nor  was  he  hindered  by  his 
infirmity  of  many  years;  for  the  effect  of  thy  voice  was 
seen  to  be  sharper  than  the  infirmity.  Wherfore,  he 
cast  down  his  heavy  burden  and  carried  the  weight  of 
his  bed,  a  testimony  to  the  abundance  of  thy  compassion.

Arouse,  O  Lord,  with  thy  divine  providence  my  soul, 
sorely  paralytic  w^ith  divers  sins  and  unseemly  deeds, 
as  thou  didst  raise  the  paralytic  of  old,  that  being  saved,

The  Epistle:  Sing  praises  to  our  God.  Sing  ye 
praises  to  our  king,  sing  ye. 

O  dap  your  hands  all  ye  nations. 

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure 
Apostles  (9:32-42) 

TN  those  days:  As  Peter  passed  throughout  all  quar- 
ters, he  came  down  also  to  the  saints  which  dwelt  at 
Lydda. 

And  he  found  there  a  certain  man  named  Eneas,  who 
had  kept  his  bed  for  eight  years,  who  was  ill  of  the 
palsy. 

And  Peter  said  to  him:  Eneas,  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ 
healeth  thee:  arise,  and  make  thy  bed.  And  immed- 
iately he  arose. 

And  all  that  dwelt  at  Lydda  and  Saron,  saw  him: 
who  were  converted  to  the  Lord. 

And  in  Joppe  there  was  a  certain  disciple  named 
Tabitha,  which  by  interpretation  is  called  Dorcas.  This 
woman  was  full  of  good  works  and  almsdeeds  which 
she  did. 

And  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days  that  she  was  sick, 
and  died.  Whom  when  they  had  washed,  they  laid  her 
in  an  upper  chamber. 

And  forasmuch  as  Lydda  was  nigh  to  Joppe,  the  dis- 
ciples hearing  that  Peter  was  there,  sent  unto  him  two 
men,  desiring  him  that  he  would  not  be  slack  to  come 
unto  them. 

And  Peter  rising  up,  went  with  them.  And  when 
he  was  come,  they  brought  him  into  the  upper  cham- 
ber.   And  all  the  widows  stood  about  him  weeping,  and 


956  Pentecostarion 

shewing  him  the  coats  and  garments  which  Dorcas 
made  them. 

And  they  all  being  put  forth,  Peter  kneeling  down 
prayed,  and  turning  to  the  body,  he  said:  Tabitha,  arise. 
And  she  opened  her  eyes;  and  seeing  Peter  she  sat  up. 

And  giving  her  his  hand,  he  lifted  her  up.  And  when 
he  had  called  the  saints  and  the  widows,  he  presented 
her  alive. 

And  it  was  made  known  throughout  all  Joppe;  and 
many  believed  in  the  Lord. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  5:1-15) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  went  up  to  Jerusalem. 

Now  there  is  at  Jerusalem  a  pond,  called  Pro- 
batica,  which  in  Hebrew  is  named  Bethsaida,  having 
five  porches. 

In  these  lay  a  great  multitude  of  sick,  of  blind,  of 
lame,  of  withered ;  waiting  for  the  moving  of  the  water. 

And  an  angel  of  the  Lord  descended  at  certain  times 
into  the  pond;  and  the  water  was  moved.  And  he  that 
went  down  first  into  the  pond  after  the  motion  of  the 
water,  was  made  whole,  of  whatsoever  infirmity  he  lay 
under. 

And  there  was  a  certain  man  there,  that  had  been 
eight  and  thirty  years  under  his  infirmity. 

Him  when  Jesus  had  seen  lying,  and  knew  that  he 
had  been  now  a  long  time,  he  saith  to  him :  Wilt  thou  be 
made  whole? 

The  infirm  man  answered  him:  Sir,  I  have  no  man 
when  the  water  is  troubled,  to  put  me  into  the  pond. 
For  whilst  I  am  coming,  another  goeth  down  before 
me. 

Jesus  saith  to  him:  Arise,  take  up  thy  bed,  and  walk. 

And  immediately  the  man  was  made  whole:  and  he 
took  up  his  bed,  and  walked.  And  it  was  the  sabbath 
that  day. 

The  Jews  therefore  said  to  him  that  was  healed:  It 
is  the  sabbath;  it  is  not  lawful  for  thee  to  take  up  thy 
bed. 


Sunday  of  the  Paralytic  957 

He  answered  them:  He  that  made  me  whole,  he  said 
to  me,  Take  up  thy  bed,  and  walk. 

They  asked  him  therefore:  Who  is  that  man  who 
said  to  thee,  Take  up  thy  bed,  and  walk? 

But  he  who  was  healed,  knew  not  who  it  was;  for 
Jesus  went  aside  from  the  multitude  standing  in  the 
place. 

Afterwards,  Jesus  findeth  him  in  the  temple,  and 
saith  to  him:  Behold  thou  art  made  whole:  sin  no 
more,  lest  some  worse  thing  happen  to  thee. 

The  man  went  his  way,  and  told  the  Jews,  that  it 
was  Jesus  who  had  made  him  whole.

us  from  the  dead  the  Light  of  Resurrection,  he  who 
was  born  of  thee. 

Synaxarion 

'^[EAR  one  of  the  gates  of  Jerusalem,  known  as  the 
^  ^  Sheep  Gate,  there  was  a  pool  also  known  as  the 
Sheep  Pool,  because  they  brought  there  sacrificial 
beasts  and  washed  their  insides  therein.  The  gate  was 
likely  called  by  that  name  because  it  was  near  the  pool. 
Or  the  gate  might  have  been  called  so  because  through 
it  passed  sheep  and  other  beasts  acceptable  for  sacrifice 
The  pool  itself,  it  seems,  was  pentagonal  in  shape,  hav- 
ing five  porches,  with  corresponding  arches,  under 
which  a  multitude  of  people,  afflicted  with  various 
diseases,  sat  awaiting  the  troubling  of  the  waters;  for 
an  angel  of  the  Lord  used  to  come  down  and  trouble 
the  water,  and  whoever  first  stepped  in  after  the  trou- 
bling of  the  water  w^as  healed  of  whatever  disease  he 
had. 

There  sat  the  impotent  man,  whose  story  is  told  us 
in  the  Gospel  section  read  on  this  day,  and  who  had 


958  Pentecostarion 

had  an  infirmity  thirty  and  eight  years.  When  Jesus 
saw  him  he  said  unto  him,  Wilt  thou  be  made  whole? 
The  impotent  man,  who  was  undoubtedly  a  poor  man 
and  a  stranger,  replied  in  a  meek  voice,  I  have  no  man, 
when  the  water  is  troubled,  to  put  me  into  the  pool. 
And  Jesus  said  to  him.  Rise,  take  up  thy  bed,  and  walk. 
Immediately  the  man  was  healed,  and  he  carried  his 
bed  and  walked  before  all  the  people,  going  to  his 
home  happy  and  pleased.  According  to  accurate 
scholars,  Jesus  healed  this  man  in  Easter  of  the  year 
32  when  he  went  up  to  Jerusalem  for  the  Feast  and 
remained  there,  teaching,  and  performing  miracles. 
Unquestionably,  too,  he  healed  him  on  the  sabbath,  as 
we  are  told  by  John  the  Evangelist  (St.  John  5:1-19).

Mid-Pentecost  Wednesday  959 

The  Epistle:  Acts  (U:6-18)  and  The  Gospel:  from 
St.  John  (7:14-31) 

Synaxarion 

A  FTER  Jesus  performed  the  miracle  of  healing  the 
impotent  man,  the  Jews,  and  especially  the  Phar- 
isees and  Scribes,  were  moved  with  envy  to  persecute 
him.  They  sought  to  kill  him  on  the  pretense  that  he 
did  not  keep  the  sabbath,  performing  miracles  thereon 
instead.  From  there  Jesus  went  to  Galilee,  and  in  the 
midst  of  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles  he  went  up  again  to 
Jerusalem,  where  he  taught.  The  Jews  wondered  at 
the  wisdom  of  his  words,  saying.  How  does  this  man 
know  the  Scriptures  when  he  is  not  educated?  But  he 
rebuked  them  at  first  for  their  lack  of  faith  and  their 
disobedience  of  the  law.  Then  he  proved  to  them 
from  the  law  that  they  were  seeking  to  kill  him  un- 
justly on  the  flimsy  accusation  that  he  scorned  the  law 
by  healing  the  paralytic  man  on  the  sabbath. 

As  there  is  a  clear  connection  between  what  Jesus 
spoke  in  the  midst  of  the  above-mentioned  feast  and 
the  story  of  the  paralytic  which  was  recited  on  the 
previous  Sunday,  and  since  we  have  reached  the  mid- 
dle of  the  period  between  the  Passover  and  Pentecost, 
the  Church  set  this  feast  after  the  Sunday  known  as 
the  Sunday  of  the  Impotent  Man,  to  be  a  bond  between 
the  two  great  Feasts,  calling  it  Mid-Pentecost,  apply- 
ing to  it  literally  the  Gospel  section  which  be2:ins,  And 
when  the  feast  had  drawn  to  its  middle,  although  its 
context  refers  to  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles  (St.  John  7). 
The  Jews  had  three  big  feasts,  namely,  the  Pass- 
over, Pentecost,  and  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles.  They 
celebrated  the  Passover  on  the  fifteenth  of  March,  be- 
in^  the  first  month  in  their  year,  commem.orating  the 
command  that  was  given  to  eat  the  lamb  on  its  eve,  and 
to  smear  the  doors  of  their  homes  with  its  blood,  as  it 
commemorates  their  delivery  from  bondage  to  the 
Egyptians,  the  death  which  passed  over  their  first-born 


960  Pentecostarion 

and  their  crossing  of  the  Red  Sea.  It  is  also  called  the 
Feast  of  Unleavened  Bread  because  in  it  they  eat  un- 
leavened bread  for  seven  days.  Pentecost  was  celebrat- 
ed by  the  Jews  on  the  fiftieth  day  after  the  Passover, 
commemorating  their  arrival  from  Egypt  at  Mount 
Sinai,  their  reception  of  the  law  from  God,  and  their 
entrance  into  the  land  of  promise,  when  they  ate  bread, 
after  the  manna,  which  they  had  eaten  until  the  forty 
years  had  ceased.  For  this  reason  they  used  to  offer 
God  on  this  feast  two  loaves  of  the  purest  of  the  new 
wheat.  Thirdly,  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles  was  cele- 
brated by  them  on  the  seven  days  between  September 
fifteenth  and  twenty-second,  when  they  sat  under  tents 
and  tree  branches  in  memory  of  their  ancestors  who 
lived  in  tents  and  tabernacles  for  forty  years  in  the  wil- 
derness (Exodus  12:19  and  Lev.  23).

Christ's  murder,  making  ready  with  joy  and  feasting 
for  the  delightful  Mid-Feast,  for  the  sake  of  both  of 
them. 

The  rich  overflowing  of  the  divine  Spirit  over  all, 
as  it  hath  been  written,  hath  drawn  near;  for  the  defer- 
ment of  the  clear  promise  that  lieth  not,  given  by  Christ 
to  his  Disciples  after  his  Death,  Burial,  and  Resurrec- 
tion, giveth  promise  of  the  appearance  of  the  Com-

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure  Apostles 
(11:19  to  end) 

TN  those  days:  When  the  disciples  had  been  dispersed 
by  the  persecution  that  arose  on  occasion  of  Stephen, 
went  about  as  far  as  Phenice  and  Cyprus  and  Antioch, 
speaking  the  word  to  none,  but  to  the  Jews  only. 

But  some  of  them  were  men  of  Cyprus  and  Cyrene, 
who,  when  they  were  entered  into  Antioch,  spoke  also 
to  the  Greeks,  preaching  the  Lord  Jesus. 

And  the  hand  of  the  Lord  was  with  them :  and  a  great 
number  believing,  were  converted  to  the  Lord. 

And  the  tidings  came  to  the  ears  of  the  church  that 
was  at  Jerusalem,  touching  these  things:  and  they  sent 
Barnabas  as  far  as  Antioch. 

Who,  when  he  was  come,  and  had  seen  the  grace  of 
God,  rejoiced :  and  he  exhorted  them  all  with  purpose 
of  heart  to  continue  in  the  Lord. 

For  he  was  a  good  man,  and  full  of  the  Holy  Ghost 
and  of  faith.  And  a  great  multitude  was  added  to  the 
Lord. 

And  Barnabas  went  to  Tarsus  to  seek  Saul :  whom, 
when  he  had  found,  he  brought  to  Antioch. 

And  they  conversed  there  in  the  church  a  whole  year; 
and  they  taught  a  great  multitude,  so  that  at  Antioch 
the  disciples  were  first  named  Christians. 

And  in  these  days  there  came  prophets  from  Jeru- 
salem to  Antioch : 

And  one  of  them  named  Agabus,  rising  up,  signified 
bv  the  Spirit,  that  there  should  be  a  great  famine  over 
the  whole  world,  which  came  to  pass  under  Claudius. 


Sunday  of  the  Samaritan  Woman  965 

And  the  disciples,  every  man  according  to  his  ability, 
purposed  to  send  relief  to  the  brethren  who  dwelt  in 
Judea: 

Which  also  they  did,  sending  it  to  the  ancients,  by 
the  hands  of  Barnabas  and  Saul. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (4:5-42) 

A  T  that  time:  As  Christ  cometh  to  a  city  of  Samaria, 
^  ^  which  is  called  Sichar,  near  the  land  which  Jacob 
gave  to  his  son  Joseph. 

Now  Jacob's  well  was  there.  Jesus  therefore  being 
wearied  with  his  journey,  sat  thus  on  the  well.  It  was 
about  the  sixth  hour. 

There  cometh  a  woman  of  Samaria,  to  draw  water. 
Jesus  saith  to  her:  Give  me  to  drink. 

For  his  disciples  were  gone  into  the  city  to  buy 
meats. 

Then  that  Samaritan  woman  saith  to  him:  How  dost 
thou,  being  a  Jew,  ask  of  me  to  drink,  who  am  a  Samari- 
tan woman?  For  the  Jews  do  not  communicate  with 
the  Samaritans. 

Jesus  answered,  and  said  to  her:  If  thou  didst  know 
the  gift  of  God,  and  who  he  is  that  saith  to  thee.  Give 
me  to  drink;  thou  perhaps  wouldst  have  asked  of  him, 
and  he  would  have  given  thee  living  water. 

The  woman  saith  to  him:  Sir,  thou  hast  nothing 
wherein  to  draw,  and  the  well  is  deep;  from  whence 
then  hast  thou  living  water? 

Art  thou  greater  than  our  father  Jacob,  who  gave  us 
the  well,  and  drank  thereof  himself,  and  his  chidlren, 
and  his  cattle? 

Jesus  answered,  and  said  to  her:  Whosoever  drinketh 
of  this  water,  shall  thirst  again;  but  he  that  shall  drink 
of  the  water  that  I  will  give  him,  shall  not  thirst  for 
ever: 

But  the  water  that  I  will  give  him,  shall  become  in 
him  a  fountain  of  water,  springing  up  into  life  ever- 
lasting. 


966  Pentecostarion 

The  woman  saith  to  him:  Sir,  give  me  this  water, 
that  I  may  not  thirst,  nor  come  hither  to  draw. 

Jesus  saith  to  her:  Go,  call  thy  husband,  and  come 
hither. 

The  woman  answered,  and  said :  I  have  no  husband. 
Jesus  said  to  her:  Thou  hast  said  well,  I  have  no  hus- 
band: 

For  thou  hast  had  five  husbands:  and  he  whom  thou 
now  hast,  is  not  thy  husband.    This  thou  hast  said  truly. 

The  woman  saith  to  him:  Sir,  I  perceive  that  thou 
art  a  prophet. 

Our  fathers  adored  on  this  mountain,  and  you  say, 
that  at  Jerusalem  is  the  place  where  men  must  adore. 

Jesus  saith  to  her:  Woman,  believe  me,  that  the  hour 
Cometh,  when  you  shall  neither  on  this  mountain,  nor 
in  Jerusalem,  adore  the  Father. 

You  adore  that  which  you  know  not:  we  adore  that 
which  we  know;  for  salvation  is  of  the  Jews. 

But  the  hour  cometh,  and  now  is,  when  the  true  ador- 
ers shall  adore  the  Father  in  spirit  and  in  truth.  For 
the  Father  also  seeketh  such  to  adore  him. 

God  is  a  spirit;  and  they  that  adore  him,  must  adore 
him  in  spirit  and  in  truth. 

The  woman  saith  to  him:  I  know  that  the  Messias 
cometh  (who  is  called  Christ)  ;  therefore,  when  he  is 
come,  he  will  tell  us  all  things. 

Jesus  saith  to  her:  I  am  he,  who  am  speaking  with 
thee. 

And  immediately  his  disciples  came;  and  they  won- 
dered that  he  talked  with  the  woman.  Yet  no  man  said  : 
What  seekest  thou?  or,  why  talkest  thou  with  her? 

The  woman  therefore  left  her  waterpot,  and  went  her 
way  into  the  city,  and  saith  to  the  men  there: 

Come,  and  see  a  man  who  has  told  me  all  things  what- 
soever I  have  done.  Is  not  he  the  Christ? 

They  went  therefore  out  of  the  city,  and  came  unto 
him. 


Sunday  of  the  Samaritan  Woman  967 

In  the  mean  time  the  disciples  prayed  him,  saying: 
Rabbi,  eat. 

But  he  said  to  them:  I  have  meat  to  eat,  which  you 
know  not. 

The  disciples  therefore  said  one  to  another :  Hath  any 
man  brought  him  to  eat? 

Jesus  saith  to  them :  My  meat  is  to  do  the  will  of  him 
that  sent  me,  that  I  may  perfect  his  work. 

Do  not  you  say.  There  are  yet  four  months,  and  then 
the  harvest  cometh?  Behold,  I  say  to  you,  lift  up  your 
eyes,  and  see  the  countries;  for  they  are  white  already  to 
harvest. 

And  he  that  reapeth  receiveth  wages,  and  gathereth 
fruit  unto  life  everlasting:  that  both  he  that  soweth,  and 
he  that  reapeth,  may  rejoice  together. 

For  in  this  is  the  saying  true:  That  it  is  one  man  that 
soweth,  and  it  is  another  that  reapeth. 

I  have  sent  you  to  reap  that  in  which  you  did  not 
labour :  others  have  laboured,  and  you  have  entered  into 
their  labours. 

Now  of  that  city  many  of  the  Samaritans  believed  in 
him,  for  the  word  of  the  woman  giving  testimony:  He 
told  me  all  things  whatsoever  I  have  done. 

So  when  the  Samaritans  were  come  to  him,  they  de- 
sired that  he  would  tarry  there.  And  he  abode  there 
two  days. 

And  many  more  believed  in  him  because  of  his  own 
word. 

And  they  said  to  the  woman  :  We  now  believe,  not  for 
thy  saying:  for  we  ourselves  have  heard  him,  and  know 
that  this  is  indeed  the  Saviour  of  the  world.

968  Pentecostarion 

Synaxarion 

THHE  city  of  Shechem  was  one  of  the  most  ancient 
cities  in  the  land  of  promise.  It  was  built  at  the 
foot  of  Mount  Gerizim,  east  of  Jericho,  where  the  sons 
of  Israel  of  old  recited  their  blessings  (Deut.  11:29). 
In  the  neighbourhood  of  this  city  Jacob,  as  he  was  re- 
turning from  Mesopotamia,  bought  a  village,  which 
was  called  at  the  time  of  Christ,  Jacob's  Well,  or  Jacob's 
Spring.  And  when  Jacob  died  in  Egypt,  he  left  this  as 
a  special  inheritance  to  Joseph  (Gen.  33  :19  and  48 :22) . 
As  for  the  above-mentioned  city,  it  became  the  capital 
of  the  ten  tribes  of  Israel,  before  the  city  of  Samaria  was 
built.  And  because  the  people  of  Israel  there  indulged 
in  the  worship  of  idols,  the  rest  of  the  Jews,  who  stood 
fast  in  piety  and  true  worship,  ridiculed  the  others,  and 
according  to  some,  called  their  city  Sukhar,  which 
means  drunkenness;  and  from  it  comes  the  word  sok- 
hara,  which  means  intoxicating  drinks. 

To  this  city  came  Jesus  about  midday.  And  being 
tired  from  travel  and  the  heat,  he  sat  down  at  the  above- 
mentioned  well.  A  little  after,  the  woman  whose  story 
is  told  in  today's  lesson,  came  to  draw  water,  and  there 
followed  a  long  conversation  between  her  and  Jesus,  in 
which  she  heard  something  about  her  own  secrets,  and 
she  believed  in  him,  and  through  her  believed  many  of 
the  Samaritans  of  her  home  town  (St.  John  4:5-42). 

We  may  also  note  that  Shalmaneser,  king  of  the  As- 
syrians, took  captive  the  ten  tribes  of  Israel  in  the  year 
721  before  Christ,  transporting  them  as  a  whole  to 
Babylon  and  Media.  Then  he  brought  together  various 
peoples  from  Babylon  and  Media  and  sent  them  to 
Samaria.  These  people  were  idol-worshippers,  who 
learned  the  worship  of  the  Jews,  believing  in  God  the 
Creator  but  also  preserving  the  worship  of  idols.  They 
accepted  of  the  Holy  Bible  only  the  five  books  of  Moses, 
contemptuously  rejecting  the  rest,  and  considering 
themselves  the  true  descendants  of  Abraham  and  Jacob. 
Those    Judaized    idol    worshippers    the    Jews    called 


Blind  Man  Sunday  969 

Samaritans,  because  they  were  strangers  and  Gentiles. 
They  did  not  mingle  with  them,  as  appears  from  the 
words  of  the  Samaritan  woman  to  Jesus  that.  The  Jews 
have  no  dealings  with  the  Samaritans  (St.  John  4:9). 
From  this  the  name  Samaritan  in  the  Gospel  accounts 
assumes  the  meaning  of  degradation.

1.   Vespers 

f[^On  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sing  seven  for  the  Resurrection 
of  the  Fifth  Tone ;  and  the  following  three  for  the  Blind  Man,  in 
the  Second  Tone. 

nnO  himself  did  the  blind  man  think  and  say,  Is  it,  I 
wonder,  for  the  sin  of  my  parents  that  I  was  born 
without  eyes?  Have  I  become  an  example  because  of  the 
faithlessness  of  the  Gentiles?  I  cease  not  from  asking. 
When  is  the  night,  when  is  the  day?  My  feet  have  no 
more  strength  from  the  impact  of  the  stones;  for  I  have 
never  seen  the  sun  shining,  nor  have  I  seen  my  Creator 
in  any  form  whatever.  Albeit,  I  beseech  thee,  O  Christ, 
God,  to  look  upon  me  and  have  mercy  upon  me.  {Re- 
peat.) 

Passing  through  the  Temple,  Jesus  saw  a  man  blind 
from  his  birth.  He  had  compassion  on  him  and  put 
clay  on  his  eyes,  then  said  to  him.  Go  to  the  pool  of  Si- 
loam  and  wash.  And  as  he  washed  his  sight  was  re- 
stored, and  he  declared  the  glorification  of  God.  But 
his  relatives  said  unto  him.  Who  opened  thine  eyes 
whom  none  that  see  could  heal?  And  he  answered  them, 
crying,  A  man  called  Jesus.  He  told  me  to  go  and  wash 
in  the  pool  of  Siloam,  and  now  I  see.  He  is  in  truth 
Christ  the  Messiah,  of  whom  Moses  wrote  in  the  law. 
He  is  the  Saviour  of  our  souls.

pASSING  by,  O  Lord,  thou  didst  find  a  man  blind 
-■'  from  birth.  The  Disciples,  in  surprise,  asked  thee, 
Teacher,  who  did  sin,  this  man  or  his  parents  that  he 
was  born  blind?  But  thou,  O  Saviour,  answered  them, 
saying,  Neither  hath  this  man  sinned,  nor  his  parents: 
but  that  the  works  of  God  should  be  made  manifest  in 
him.  I  must  work  the  works  of  him  that  sent  me,  which 
none  else  can  work.  And  as  thou  saidst  that,  thou  didst 
spit  on  the  ground,  and  make  clay  thereof,  and  anoint 
his  eyes.  And  thou  didst  say  unto  him,  Go,  wash  in  the 
pool  of  Siloam.  And  when  he  washed,  he  began  to 
shout  unto  thee,  Lord,  I  believe.  And  he  worshipped 
thee.  Wherefore,  we,  too,  cry  out  to  thee.  Have  mercy 
upon  us.

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure  Apostles 

(16:16-34) 

TN  those  days,  as  we  the  disciples  went  to  prayer:  A 
certain  girl,  having  a  pythonical  spirit,  met  us,  who 

brought  to  her  masters  much  gain  by  divining. 

This  same  following  Paul  and  us,  cried  out,  saying: 

These  men  are  the  servants  of  the  most  high  God,  who 

preach  unto  you  the  way  of  salvation. 

And  this  she  did  many  days.    But  Paul  being  grieved, 

turned,  and  said  to  the  spirit:  I  command  thee,  in  the 

name  of  Jesus  Christ,  to  go  out  from  her.    And  he  went 

out  the  same  hour. 


Blind  Man  Sunday  973 

But  her  masters,  seeing  that  the  hope  of  their  gain  was 
gone,  apprehending  Paul  and  Silas,  brought  them  into 
the  marketplace  to  the  rulers. 

And  presenting  them  to  the  magistrates,  they  said: 
These  men  disturb  our  city,  being  Jews; 

And  preach  a  fashion  which  it  is  not  lawful  for  us  to 
receive  nor  observe,  being  Romans. 

And  the  people  ran  together  against  them;  and  the 
magistrates  rending  off  their  clothes,  commanded  them 
to  be  beaten  with  rods. 

And  when  they  had  laid  many  stripes  upon  them  they 
cast  them  into  prison,  charging  the  gaoler  to  keep  them 
diligently. 

Who  having  received  such  a  charge,  thrust  them  into 
the  inner  prison,  and  made  their  feet  fast  in  the  stocks. 

And  at  midnight,  Paul  and  Silas  praying,  praised 
God.    And  they  that  were  in. prison,  heard  them. 

And  suddenly  there  was  a  great  earthquake,  so  that 
the  foundations  of  the  prison  were  shaken.  And  im- 
mediately all  the  doors  were  opened,  and  the  bands  of 
all  were  loosed. 

And  the  keeper  of  the  prison,  awaking  out  of  his 
sleep,  and  seeing  the  doors  of  the  prison  open,  drawing 
his  sword,  would  have  killed  himself,  supposing  that 
the  prisoners  had  been  fled. 

But  Paul  cried  with  a  loud  voice,  saying:  Do  thy- 
self no  harm,  for  we  all  are  here. 

Then  calling  for  a  light,  he  went  in  and  trembling, 
fell  down  at  the  feet  of  Paul  and  Silas. 

And  bringing  them  out,  he  said :  Masters,  what  must 
T  do,  that  I  may  be  saved? 

But  they  said:  Believe  in  the  Lord  Jesus,  and  thou 
shalt  be  saved,  and  thy  house. 

And  they  preached  the  word  of  the  Lord  to  him  and 
to  all  that  were  in  his  house. 

And  he,  taking  them  the  same  hour  of  the  night, 
washed  their  stripes,  and  himself  was  baptized,  and  all 
his  house  immediately. 


974  Pentecostarion 

And  when  he  had  brought  them  into  his  own  house, 
he  laid  the  table  for  them,  and  rejoiced  with  all  his 
house,  believing  God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (9:1-38) 

AT  that  time:  When  Jesus  passed  by,  he  saw  a  man, 
who  was  blind  from  his  birth  : 

And  his  disciples  asked  him :  Rabbi,  who  hath  sinned, 
this  man,  or  his  parents,  that  he  should  be  born  blind? 

Jesus  answered  :  Neither  hath  this  man  sinned,  nor  his 
parents ;  but  that  the  works  of  God  should  be  made  man- 
ifest in  him. 

I  must  work  the  works  of  him  that  sent  me,  whilst  it 
is  day:  the  night  cometh,  when  no  man  can  work. 

As  long  as  I  am  in  the  world,  I  am  the  light  of  the 
world. 

When  he  had  said  these'things,  he  spat  on  the  ground, 
and  made  clay  of  the  spittle,  and  spread  the  clay  upon 
his  eyes. 

And  said  to  him  :  Go,  wash  in  the  pool  of  Siloe,  which 
is  interpreted,  Sent.  He  went  therefore,  and  washed, 
and  he  came  seeing. 

The  neighbours  therefore,  and  they  who  had  seen  him 
before  that  he  was  a  beggar,  said :  Is  not  this  he  that  sat 
and  begged  ?  Some  said  :  This  is  he. 

But  others  said  :  No,  but  he  is  like  him.  But  he  said  : 
I  am  he. 

Thev  said  therefore  to  him:  How  were  thy  eyes 
opened? 

He  answered:  That  man  that  is  called  Jesus  made 
clay,  and  anointed  my  eyes,  and  said  to  me:  Go  to  the 
pool  of  Siloe,  and  wash.  And  I  went,  I  washed,  and  I 
see. 

And  they  said  to  him :  Where  is  he?  He  said :  I  know 
not. 

They  bring  him  that  had  been  blind  to  the  Pharisees. 

Now  it  was  the  sabbath,  when  Jesus  made  the  clay, 
and  opened  his  eyes. 


Blind  Man  Sunday  975 

Again  therefore  the  Pharisees  asked  him,  how  he  had 
received  his  sight.  But  he  said  to  them:  He  put  clay 
upon  my  eyes,  and  I  washed,  and  I  see. 

Some  therefore  of  the  Pharisees  said :  This  man  is  not 
of  God,  who  keepeth  not  the  sabbath.  But  others  said: 
How  can  a  man  that  is  a  sinner  do  such  miracles?  And 
there  was  a  division  among  them. 

They  say  therefore  to  the  blind  man  again  :  What  say- 
est  thou  of  him  that  hath  opened  thy  eyes?  And  he  said : 
He  is  a  prophet. 

The  Jews  then  did  not  believe  concerning  him,  that 
he  had  been  blind,  and  had  received  his  sight,  until  they 
called  the  parents  of  him  that  had  received  his  sight. 

And  asked  them,  saying:  Is  this  your  son,  who  you 
say  was  born  blind?  How  then  doth  he  now  see? 

His  parents  answered  them,  and  said :  We  know  that 
this  is  our  son,  and  that  he  was  born  blind: 

But  how  he  now  seeth,  we  know  not;  or  who  hath 
opened  his  eyes,  we  know  not:  ask  himself:  he  is  of  age, 
let  him  speak  for  himself. 

These  things  his  parents  said,  because  they  feared  the 
Jews:  for  the  Jews  had  already  agreed  among  them- 
selves, that  if  any  man  should  confess  him  to  be  Christ, 
he  should  be  put  out  of  the  synagogue. 

Therefore  did  his  parents  say:  He  is  of  age,  ask  him- 
self. 

They  therefore  called  the  man  again  that  had  been 
blind,  and  said  to  him:  Give  glory  to  God.  We  know 
that  this  man  is  a  sinner. 

He  said  therefore  to  them:  If  he  be  a  sinner,  I  know 
not:  one  thing  I  know,  that  whereas  I  was  blind,  now 
I  see. 

They  said  then  to  him:  What  did  he  to  thee?  How 
did  he  open  thy  eyes? 

He  answered  them :  I  have  told  you  already,  and  you 
have  heard:  why  would  you  hear  it  again?  will  you 
also  become  his  disciples? 

They  reviled  him  therefore,  and  said:  Be  thou  his 
disciple ;  but  we  are  the  disciples  of  Moses. 


976  Pentecostarion 

We  know  that  God  spoke  to  Moses:  but  as  to  this 
man,  we  know  not  from  whence  he  is. 

The  man  answered,  and  said  to  them:  Why,  herein  is 
a  wonderful  thing,  that  you  know  not  from  whence  he 
is,  and  he  hath  opened  my  eyes. 

Now  we  know  that  God  doth  not  hear  sinners :  but 
if  a  man  be  a  server  of  God,  and  doeth  his  will,  him  he 
heareth. 

From  the  beginning  of  the  world  it  hath  not  been 
heard,  that  any  man  hath  opened  the  eyes  of  one  born 
blind. 

Unless  this  man  were  of  God,  he  could  not  do  any 
thing. 

They  answered,  and  said  to  him:  Thou  wast  wholly 
born  in  sins,  and  dost  thou  teach  us?  And  they  cast  him 
out. 

Jesus  heard  that  they  had  cast  him  out:  and  when  he 
had  found  him,  he  said  to  him :  Dost  thou  believe  in  the 
Son  of  God? 

He  answered,  and  said :  Who  is  he.  Lord,  that  I  may 
believe  in  him? 

And  Jesus  said  to  him  :  Thou  hast  both  seen  him ;  and 
it  is  he  that  talketh  with  thee. 

And  he  said :  I  believe,  Lord.  And  falling  down,  he 
adored  him.

Synaxarion 

V\/HILE  Jesus  was  leaving  the  Temple  on  a  sabbath 
he  met  on  the  way  this  young  blind  man,  whose 
story  is  told  in  the  Gospel  section  read  on  this  day.  The 
young  man  was  blind  from  his  mother's  womb,  of  age, 
and  incurable  after  every  human  effort.  When  Jesus 
saw  him,  he  spit  on  the  ground,  and  making  clay  of  the 
spittle,  anointed  the  eyes  of  the  man,  and  said  to  him, 
Go,  wash  in  the  Pool  of  Siloam  (which  is  by  interpre- 
tation. Sent).  This  pool  was  a  famous  spring  of  water 


The  Ascension  977 

in  Jerusalem,  because  it  was  used  so  often  by  the  people, 
and  it  flowed  around  the  city  walls  from  the  eastern  side 
and  emptied  into  the  Pool  of  Siloam. 

Jesus  did  not  send  the  blind  man  to  that  pool  to  wash 
his  eyes  that  had  been  anointed  with  the  clay,  because 
the  water  had  any  special  property  to  heal  blind  men's 
eyes,  but  to  test  the  faith  and  obedience  of  him  who  was 
sent,  and  also  to  give  the  miracle  greater  fame,  that  it 
might  become  known  of  all  people  beyond  doubt.  The 
blind  man  believed  the  words  of  Jesus  and  obeyed  his 
command.  He  washed  and  returned  whole  and  seeing, 
not  blind  as  he  had  been.  As  the  Gospel  section  read  on 
this  day  (St.  John  9:1-38)  tells  the  story  of  the  blind 
man  in  detail,  especially  making  clear  his  confession  of 
the  Name  of  his  Healer,  in  his  answer  to  the  question- 
ers, how  he  preached  him  before  the  Pharisees,  and  how 
finally  he  was  expelled  with  curses  by  the  enemies  of 
truth  because  he  explained  the  truth,  and  because  of  his 
confession,  we  need  not  expand  it  here.

Prophet  (2:2-3) 

nPHESE  sayings  the  Lord  doth  say:  In  the  last  days 
the  mountain  of  the  house  of  the  Lord  shall  be  pre- 
pared on  the  top  of  mountains,  and  it  shall  be  exalted 
above  the  hills,  and  all  nations  shall  flow  unto  it. 

And  many  people  shall  go,  and  say:  Come  and  let  us 
go  up  to  the  mountain  of  the  Lord,  and  to  the  house  of 
the  God  of  Jacob,  and  he  will  teach  us  his  ways,  and  we 
will  walk  in  his  paths.

^TPHESE  sayings  the  Lord  doth  say:  Go  through,  go 
through  the  gates,  prepare  the  way  for  the  people, 
make  the  road  plain,  pick  out  the  stones,  and  lift  up  the 
standard  to  the  people. 

Behold  the  Lord  hath  made  it  to  be  heard  in  the  ends 
of  the  earth,  tell  the  daughter  of  Sion:  Behold  thy  Sav-

work  before  him. 

And  they  shall  call  them,  The  holy  people,  the  re- 
deemed of  the  Lord.  But  thou  shalt  be  called :  A  city

bestowed  upon  us,  and  for  the  multitude  of  his  good 
things  to  the  house  of  Israel,  which  he  hath  given  them 
according  to  his  kindness,  and  according  to  the  multi- 
tude of  his  mercies. 

And  he  said :  Surely  they  are  my  people,  children  that 
will  not  deny:  so  he  became  their  saviour. 

In  all  their  affliction  he  was  not  troubled,  and  the 
angel  of  his  presence  saved  them :  in  his  love,  and  in  his 
mercy  he  redeemed  them,  and  he  carried  them  and  lift- 
ed them  up  all  the  days  of  old. 

Third  Reading:   from   the  Prophecy   of  Xecharia   the 
Prophet  (14:1;  4;  8-11) 

'  I  ^HESE  sayings  the  Lord  doth  say:  The  days  of  the 
Lord  shall  come;  his  feet  shall  stand  in  that  day 
upon  the  mount  of  Olives,  which  is  over  against  Jeru- 
salem toward  the  East. 

And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in  that  day,  that  living 
waters  shall  go  out  from  Jerusalem :  half  of  them  to  the 
east  sea,  and  half  of  them  to  the  last  sea :  they  shall  be  in 
summer  and  in  winter. 

And  the  Lord  shall  be  king  over  all  the  earth :  in  that 
day  there  shall  be  one  Lord,  and  his  name  shall  be  one. 

And  all  the  land  shall  return  even  to  the  desert,  from 
the  hill  to  Remmon  to  the  south  of  Jerusalem:  and  she 
shall  be  exalted,  and  shall  dwell  in  her  own  place,  from 
the  gate  of  Benjamin  even  to  the  place  of  the  former 
gate,  and  even  to  the  gate  of  the  corners:  and  from  the 
tower  of  Hananeel  even  to  the  king's  wine  presses. 

And  people  shall  dwell  in  it,  and  there  shall  be  no 
more  an  anathema:  but  Jerusalem  shall  sit  secure.

Vt/^HEN  thou  (fidst  fulfill  the  mystery  hidden  from 
the  generations  since  the  ages,  since  thou  art  good, 
O  L>()rd,  thou  didst  come  with  thy  Disciples  to  the 
Mount  of  Olives,  and  with  thee  was  thy  Mother,  O 
Maker  and  Creator  of  all;  for  she,  who  more  than  all 
suffered  maternally  at  thy  Passion,  should  likewise  enjoy 
more  than  all  the  joy  of  thy  humanity's  honouring,  O 
Master,  which  having  also  attained  by  thine  Ascension 
to  the  heavens,  we  glorify  exceedingly  thy  mercies  upon 
us.

nPHOU  wast  born  as  thou  didst  will,  O  our  God; 
thou  didst  appear  of  thine  own  choice,  and  suffer  in 
the  flesh.  Thou  didst  rise  from  the  dead,  and  didst 
tread  down  death,  ascending  in  glory,  O  thou  who  ful-

He  is  in  truth  the  King  of  glory.  Wherefore,  are  his

elevation,  and  the  Disciples  were  amazed  at  thy 
dread  rising,  thou  didst  ascend  in  glory,  being  God,  and

The  foremost  of  the  angels,  O  Saviour,  beholding  thy 
strange  Ascension,  were  bewildered,  as  they  consulted 
one  with  another,  saying,  What  sight  is  this?  For  he  who 
is  seen  in  the  likeness  of  man,  yet  being  God,  doth  as- 
cend in  the  flesh  above  the  heavens. 

When  the  Galileans  beheld  thee,  O  Word,  ascending

Apostles  (1:1-12) 

^TPHP^  former  treatise  I  made,  O  Theophilus,  of  all 
things  which  Jesus  began  to  do  and  to  teach. 

Until  the  day  on  which,  giving  commandments  by 
the  Holy  Ghost  to  the  apostles  whom  he  had  chosen, 
he  was  taken  up. 

To  whom  also  he  showed  himself  alive  after  his  pas- 
sion, by  many  proofs,  for  forty  days  appearing  to  them, 
and  speaking  of  the  kingdom  of  God. 

And  eating  together  with  them,  he  commanded  them, 
that  they  should  not  depart  from  Jerusalem,  but  should 
wait  for  the  promise  of  the  Father,  which  you  have 
heard  (saith  he)  by  my  mouth. 

For  John  indeed  baptized  with  water,  but  you  shall 
be  baptized  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  not  many  days  hence. 


The  Ascension  987 

They  therefore,  who  were  come  together,  asked  him, 
saying:  Lord,  wilt  thou  at  this  time  restore  again  the 
kingdom  to  Israel? 

But  he  said  to  them:  It  is  not  for  you  to  know  the 
times  or  moments,  which  the  Father  hath  put  in  his 
own  power. 

But  you  shall  receive  the  power  of  the  Holy  Ghost 
coming  upon  you^  and  you  shall  be  witnesses  unto  me  in 
Jerusalem,  and  in  all  Judea,  and  Samaria,  and  even  to 
the  uttermost  part  of  the  earth. 

And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  while  they  looked 
on,  he  was  raised  up:  and  a  cloud  received  him  out  of 
their  sight. 

And  while  they  were  beholding  him  going  up  to 
heaven,  behold  two  men  stood  by  them  in  white  gar- 
ments. 

Who  also  said:  Ye  men  of  Galilee,  why  stand  you 
looking  up  to  heaven?  This  Jesus  who  is  taken  up 
from  you  into  heaven^  shall  so  come,  as  you  have  seen 
him  going  into  heaven. 

Then  they  returned  to  Jerusalem  from  the  mount  that 
is  called  Olivet,  which  is  nigh  Jerusalem,  within  a  sab- 
bath day's  journey.

Synaxarion 

A  FTER  his  Resurrection  Jesus  remained  on  earth 
forty  days,  appearing  at  intervals  to  his  Disciples 
in  various  places.  He  ate,  drank,  and  conversed  with 
them,  thus  verifying  and  assuring  his  Resurrection.  On 
this  day,  corresponding  to  the  fortieth  day  from  the 
Passover,  falling  then  on  the  third  of  May,  he  appeared 
to  them  in  Jerusalem.  He  first  conversed  with  them  on 
various  topics;  then  he  gave  them  his  last  command- 
ment, to  go  forth  and  preach  in  his  Name  to  all  the 


988  Pcntecostarion 

nations,  beginning  with  Jerusalem.  iVt  the  same  time 
he  told  them  not  to  depart  from  Jerusalem,  but  to  re- 
main there  a  while  until  they  were  clothed  with  power 
from  on  high  by  the  descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit  upon 
them. 

Having  said  this,  he  led  them  to  the  Mount  of  Olives. 
Then  he  lifted  up  his  hands  and  blessed  them.  And  as 
he  was  speaking  to  them  with  words  of  fatherly  bless- 
ing, he  was  parted  from  them  and  ascended  into  heaven, 
being  received  by  a  shining  cloud,  indicating  his  divine 
majesty.  He  sat  on  it  as  on  a  royal  chariot  and  began 
to  ascend  to  heaven,  gradually  disappearing  from  the 
sight  of  the  Disciples  as  they  gazed  at  him.  And  as  they 
stood  thus  two  angels  in  brilliant  white  robes  appeared 
to  them  in  the  form  of  men  and  said  to  them,  Ye  men 
of  Galilee,  why  stand  ye  gazing  up  into  heaven?  This 
same  Jesus,  which  is  taken  up  from  you  into  heaven, 
shall  so  come  in  like  manner  as  ye  have  seen  him  go  into 
heaven.  In  these  words,  therefore,  is  fulfilled  and  de- 
fined the  doctrine  concerning  the  Son  of  God  and  his 
Word,  in  the  Confession  of  Faith.  And  thus  after  our 
Lord  Jesus  Christ  fulfilled  all  his  great  dispensation 
for  us.  He  ascended  in  glory  into  heaven,  and  sat  on 
the  right  hand  of  God  the  Father.  As  for  his  undefilcd 
Disciples,  they  returned  to  Jerusalem  from  the  Mount 
of  Olives,  rejoicing  in  the  promise  of  the  coming  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  (St.  Lk.  24:46-52  and  Acts  1  :1-12). 

Tt  may  be  explained  that  the  Mount  of  Olives  was  at 
such  a  distance  from  Jerusalem  as  would  permit  the 
jews  to  walk  to  it  on  the  sabbath;  hence,  it  is  said  that 
it  was  a  sabbath  day's  journey.  Tncomanius  (in  his 
commentary  on  Acts)  explained  that  the  distance  must 
have  been  one  mile,  or  two  thousand  cubits,  as  Origen 
also  says  in  the  Fifth  of  his  Stromata.  They  deduce 
this  from  the  fact  that  the  tents  of  the  Israelites  of  old 
in  the  wilderness  were  about  that  distance  from  the  cu- 
pola of  the  holy  tabernacle  of  the  covenant,  to  which 
they  walked  on  the  sabbath  for  the  worship  of  God.

Sunday  of  the  Holy  Fathers 

Gathered  in  the  First  Council  of  the  City  of  Nicea 

I.   Vespers 

CO/i  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  three  for  the  Resurrection  of  the 
Sixth  Tone,  and  three  for  the  Ascension,  in  the  Sajne  Tone  (see  the 
first]  three  pieces  for  Vespers  of  the  Ascension,  p.  977) ;  and  the  fol- 
lozving  four  for  the  Fathers,  in  the  Same  Tone. 

/^F  the  Father  before  the  morning  star  thou  wast  be- 
^-^  gotten  from  the  belly  without  mother  before  all 
the  ages,  even  though  Arius  did  believe  thee  to  be  cre- 
ated, not  God,  classing  thee  in  ignorance  and  impudence 
with  creatures,  storing  up  for  himself  the  element  of 
eternal  fire.  Yet  the  Nicean  Council  proclaimed  thee, 
preaching  that  thou  art,  O  Lord,  Son  of  God,  equal  to 
the  Father  in  the  throne,  and  to  the  Spirit  also. 

When  thou  wast  asked,  O  Saviour,  Who  rent  thy  rai- 
ment? Thou  didst  reply  that  it  was  Arius,  who  divided 
the  headship  of  the  Trinity,  united  in  honour,  into 
parts;  for  this  same  denied  that  thou  art  one  of  the 
most  Holy  Trinity.  He  it  was  who  taught  the  transgress- 
ing Nestorius  not  to  say  that  the  Virgin  is  the  Theo- 
tokos.  But  the  Nicean  Council  warned  openly  that 
thou  art  Son  of  God,  equal  in  the  throne  to  the  Father, 
and  to  the  Spirit  also. 

Pretending  blindness  that  he  might  not  see  the  light, 
Arius  toppled  into  the  pit  of  sin,  and  his  bowels  were

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure 
Apostles  (20:16-18;  28-36) 

TN  those  days:  Paul  had  determined  to  sail  by  Ephe- 
sus,  lest  he  should  be  stayed  any  time  in  Asia.  For 
he  hasted,  if  it  were  possible  for  him,  to  keep  the  day 
of  Pentecost  at  Jerusalem. 

And  sending  from  Miletus  to  Ephesus,  he  called  the 
ancients  of  the  church. 

And  when  they  were  come  to  him,  and  were  together, 
he  said  to  them: 

Take  heed  to  yourselves,  and  to  the  whole  flock, 
wherein  the  Holy  Ghost  hath  placed  you  bishops,  to 
rule  the  church  of  God,  which  he  hath  purchased  with 
his  own  blood. 

I  know  that,  after  my  departure,  ravening  wolves 
will  enter  in  among  you,  not  sparing  the  flock. 

And  of  your  own  selves  shall  arise  men  speaking  per- 
verse things,  to  draw  away  disciples  after  them. 

Therefore  watch,  keeping  in  memory,  that  for  three 
years  I  ceased  not,  with  tears  to  admonish  every  one 
of  you  night  and  day. 

And  now  I  commend  you  to  God,  and  to  the  word 
of  his  grace,  who  is  able  to  build  up,  and  to  give  an 
inheritance  among  all  the  sanctified. 

I  have  not  coveted  any  man's  silver,  gold,  or  apparel, 
as 

You  yourselves  know:  for  such  things  as  were  need- 
ful for  me  and  them  that  are  with  me,  these  hands  have 
furnished. 

I  have  showed  you  all  things,  how  that  so  labouring 
you  ought  to  support  the  weak,  and  to  remember  the 


992  Pentecostarion 

word  of  the  Lord  Jesus,  how  he  said:   It  is  a  more 
blessed  thing  to  give  rather  than  to  receive. 

And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  kneeling  down, 
he  prayed  with  them  all. 

The  Gospel:  from  St,  John  (17:1-13) 

AT  that  time:  Jesus  lifting  up  his  eyes  to  heaven,  he 
said :  Father,  the  hour  is  come,  glorify  thy  Son, 
that  thy  Son  may  glorify  thee. 

As  thou  hast  given  him  power  over  all  flesh,  that  he 
may  give  eternal  life  to  all  whom  thou  hast  given  him. 

Now  this  is  eternal  life:  That  they  may  know  thee, 
the  only  true  God,  and  Jesus  Christ,  whom  thou  hast 
sent. 

I  have  glorified  thee  on  the  earth ;  I  have  finished  the 
work  which  thou  gavest  me  to  do. 

And  now  glorify  thou  me,  O  Father,  with  thyself, 
with  the  glory  which  I  had,  before  the  world  was,  with 
thee. 

I  have  manifested  thy  name  to  the  men  whom  thou 
hast  given  me  out  of  the  world.  Thine  they  were,  and 
to  me  thou  gavest  them  ;  and  they  have  kept  thy  word. 

Now  they  have  known,  that  all  things  which  thou 
hast  given  me,  are  from  thee: 

Because  the  words  which  thou  gavest  me,  I  have 
given  to  them;  and  they  have  received  them,  and  have 
known  in  very  deed  that  I  came  out  from  thee,  and  they 
have  believed  that  thou  didst  send  me. 

I  pray  for  them:  I  pray  not  for  the  world,  but  for 
them  whom  thou  hast  given  me :  because  they  are  thine : 

And  all  my  things  are  thine,  and  thine  are  mine;  and 
I  am  glorified  in  them. 

And  now  I  am  not  in  the  world,  and  these  are  in  the 
world,  and  T  come  to  thee.  Holy  Father,  keep  them  in 
thy  name  whom  thou  hast  given  i7ic;  that  they  may  be 
one,  as  we  also  are. 

While  I  was  with  them,  T  kept  them  in  thy  name. 
(Those  whom  thou  gavest  me  have  T  kept;  and  none 


Holy  l^ithcrs  Sunday  993 

of  them  is  lost,  but  the  son  of  perdition,  that  the  scrip- 
ture may  be  fulfilled. 

And  now  T  come  to  thee;  and  these  things  I  speak  in 
the  world,  that  they  may  have  my  joy  filled  in  them- 
selves. '

Synaxarion 

/^N  which  is  chanted  the  service  of  the  three  hun- 
^^  dred  and  eighteen  divines  who  were  gathered  in 
the  First  Ecumenical  Council  held  in  the  city  of  Nicea. 

Arius,  the  notorious  heretic,  was  a  native  of  Libya, 
and  was  first  ordained  archpriest  of  Alexandria.  Fol- 
lowing this,  in  the  year  315,  he  began  to  blaspheme 
against  the  Son  of  God  and  his  Word,  saying  that  he 
was  not  God  consubstantial  with  the  Father,  but  that  he 
was  created,  a  stranger  to  the  Substance  of  the  Father 
and  his  glory.  He  troubled  the  faithful  of  Alexandria 
with  his  horrible  blasphemy,  and  it  was  then  that  Cyril, 
the  Archbishop  of  Alexandria,  tried  to  restrain  him 
with  his  counsels.  Failing  in  this,  Cyril  was  forced  in 
321  to  call  a  local  council  and  to  cut  him  ofif  and  excom- 
municate him.  But  that  blasphemer  did  not  stop,  nor 
wished  to  desist  from  sowing  the  seeds  of  his  tares,  by 
propagating  that  destructive,  venemous  heresy.  And 
thus  the  poison  of  his  error  crept  into  many,  reaching 
distant  places,  disturbing  the  Church  of  Christ,  and 
causing  it  great  harm. 

And  when  Constantine  the  Great,  the  first  of  the 
Christian  kines,  coequal  with  the  Apostles,  saw  this,  he 
was  moved  by  divine  zeal,  and  held  an  ecumenical 
council  in  the  city  of  Nicea  in  Bithynia,  which  was  the 
first  of  the  ecumenical  councils.  To  this  came  the 
Bishops  and  teachers  of  the  Church  of  Christ  from 
everv  land  ^nd  nroclaimed  all,  as  by  one  mouth,  the 
eauality  of  thr  Son  of  God,  and  his  Word,  with  the 
Father,  in  Substance,  and  that  he  was  very  God  of 
very  God,  laving  down  the  noble  Confession  of  Faith 


994  Pentecostarion 

(the  Creed)  to  where  it  says,  And  in  the  Holy  Spirit 
(for  the  completion  of  the  Creed  was  written  by  the 
Second  Ecumenical  Council) .  As  for  Arius  the  atheist 
of  evil  doctrine,  and  those  who  agreed  with  him,  they 
were  excommunicated  and  cut  off  from  the  body  of 
the  Church. 

And  since  the  Church  regards  those  divine  Fathers 
as  preachers  of  the  faith  next  to  the  divinity-speak- 
ing Apostles,  and  confesses  to  the  same,  it  decreed 
that  their  memory  be  celebrated  each  year  on  this 
Sunday,  for  the  glorification  of  God  and  his  praise,  and 
to  honour  and  praise  those  Fathers  for  the  establish- 
ment of  the  Orthodox  Faith.

In  the  First  Tone 

T  O,  we  celebrate  the  Feast  of  Pentecost,  the  presence 
^^  of  the  Spirit,  the  fulfillment  of  the  promise  and 
the  completion  of  hope.  How  wonderful  is  this  mys- 
tery; for  it  is  great  and  most  solemn.  Wherefore,  we 
cry  unto  thee,  O  Lord  and  Creator  of  ail,  glory  to  thee. 
{Repeat.) 

Thou  hast  renewed  for  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ,  a  dif- 
ferent kind  of  tongues,  that  they  might  therewith  pro- 
claim that  thou  art  the  immortal  Word  and  God  who 
granteth  our  souls  the  Great  Mercy. 

The  Holy  Spirit  provideth  all;  overfloweth  with 
prophecy;  fulfilleth  the  Priesthood;  and  hath  taught 
wisdom  to  the  illiterate.  He  hath  revealed  the  fisher- 
men as  theologians.  He  bringeth  together  all  the  laws 
of  the  Church.  Wherefore,  O  Comforter,  equal  to  the 
Father  in  Substance  and  the  throne,  glory  to  thee.

^Theii  after  the  FAsodos  mul  O  resplendent  Light,  etc.,  and  the 
daily  Prokcinietin7i,  recite  the  following  Readings. 

First  Reading:  from  the  Book  of  Numbers 
(11:16-17;  24-29) 

A  N  D  the  Lord  said  to  Moses :  Gather  unto  me  seven- 
^  ty  men  of  the  ancients  of  Israel,  whom  thou  know- 
est  to  be  ancients  and  masters  of  the  people:  and  thou 
shalt  bring  them  to  the  door  of  the  tabernacle  of  the 
covenant,  and  shalt  make  them  stand  there  with  thee. 

That  I  may  come  down  and  speak  with  thee:  and 
I  will  take  of  thy  spirit,  and  will  give  to  them,  that  they 
may  bear  with  thee  the  burden  of  the  people,  and  thou 
mayest  not  be  burdened  alone. 

Moses  therefore  came,  and  told  the  people  the  words 
of  the  Lord,  and  assembled  seventy  men  of  the  ancients 
of  Israel,  and  made  them  to  stand  about  the  tabernacle. 

And  the  Lord  came  down  in  a  cloud,  and  spoke  to 
him,  taking  away  of  the  spirit  that  was  in  Moses,  and 


Pentecost  997 

giving  to  the  seventy  men.  And  when  the  spirit  had 
rested  on  them  they  prophesied,  nor  did  they  cease  after- 
wards. 

Now  there  remained  in  the  camp  two  of  the  men,  of 
whom  one  was  called  Eldad,  and  the  other  Medad, 
upon  whom  the  spirit  rested;  for  they  also  had  been 
enrolled,  but  were  not  gone  forth  to  the  tabernacle. 

And  when  they  prophesied  in  the  camp,  there  ran  a 
young  man,  and  told  Moses,  saying:  Eldad  and  Medad 
prophesy  in  the  camp. 

Forthwith  Josue  the  son  of  Nun,  the  minister  of 
Moses,  and  chosen  out  of  many,  said:  My  lord  Moses 
forbid  them. 

But  he  said:  Why  hast  thou  emulation  for  me?  O 
that  all  the  people  might  prophesy,  and  that  the  Lord 
would  give  them  his  spirit! 

Second  Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Joel 
(2:23  to  end) 

nPHESE  sayings  our  Lord  doth  say:  O  children  of 
Sion,  rejoice,  and  be  joyful  in  the  Lord  your  God: 
because  he  hath  given  you  a  teacher  of  justice  and  he 
will  make  the  early  and  the  latter  rain  to  come  down  to 
you  as  in  the  beginning. 

And  the  floors  shall  be  filled  with  wheat,  and  the 
presses  shall  overflow  with  wine  and  oil. 

And  I  will  restore  to  you  the  ears  which  the  locust, 
and  the  bruchus,  and  the  mildew,  and  the  palmerworm 
have  eaten;  my  great  host  which  I  sent  upon  you. 

And  you  shall  eat  in  plenty,  and  shall  be  filled :  and 
you  shall  praise  the  name  of  the  Lord  your  God,  who 
hath  done  wonders  with  you,  and  my  people  shall  not 
be  confounded  for  ever. 

And  you  shall  know  that  I  am  in  the  midst  of  Israel : 
and  I  am  the  Lord  your  God,  and  there  is  none  besides: 
and  my  people  shall  not  be  confounded  for  ever. 

And  it  shall  come  to  pass  after  this,  that  I  will  pour 
out  my  spirit  upon  all  flesh:  and  your  sons  and  your 


998  Pentecostarion 

daughters  shall  prophesy:  your  old  men  shall  dream 
dreams,  and  your  young  men  shall  see  visions. 

Moreover  upon  my  servants  and  handmaids  in  those 
days  I  will  pour  forth  my  spirit. 

And  I  will  shew  wonders  in  heaven;  and  in  earth 
blood,  and  fire,  and  vapour  of  smoke. 

The  sun  shall  be  turned  into  darkness,  and  the  moon 
into  blood:  before  the  great  and  dreadful  day  of  the 
Lord  doth  come. 

And  it  shall  come  to  pass,  that  every  one  that  shall 
call  upon  the  name  of  the  Lord  shall  be  saved. 

Third  Reading:  from  the  Prophecy  of  Ezekiel 
the  Prophet  (36:24-28) 

nPHESE  sayings  our  Lord  doth  say:  I  will  take  you 
from  among  the  Gentiles,  and  will  gather  you  to- 
gether out  of  all  the  countries,  and  will  bring  you  into 
your  own  land. 

And  I  will  pour  upon  you  clean  water,  and  you  shall 
be  cleansed  from  all  your  filthiness,  and  I  will  cleanse 
you  from  all  your  idols. 

And  I  will  give  you  a  new  heart,  and  put  a  new  spirit 
within  you:  and  I  will  take  away  the  stony  heart  out 
of  your  flesh,  and  will  give  you  a  heart  of  flesh. 

And  I  will  put  my  spirit  in  the  midst  of  you:  and 
I  will  cause  you  to  walk  in  my  commandments,  and  to 
keep  my  judgments,  and  do  them. 

And  you  shall  dwell  in  the  land  which  I  gave  to  your 
fathers,  and  you  shall  be  my  people,  and  I  will  be  your 
God.

mankind. 

Stichos:  Create  in  me  a  new  heart,  O  God;  and  re- 
new a  right  spirit  within  my  bowels. 

The  coming  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  O  Lord,  and  his  en- 
compassing of  thy  Disciples,  revealed  them  as  speaking 
with  other  tongues,  hence  the  miraculous  wonder.  As 
for  the  unbelievers,  they  thought  it  drunkenness,  and 
the  believers,  a  cause  of  salvation  to  them.  Wherefore, 
we  beseech  thee  to  make  us  ready  for  his  illumination, 
O  Lover  of  mankind. 

Stichos:  Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  face,  and  take 
not  thy  Holy  Spirit  from  me. 

O  heavenly  King,  the  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth, 
who  art  in  all  places,  and  fillest  all  things,  Treasury 
of  good  things,  and  Giver  of  life,  come,  and  take  up

^^  boldness  of  the  tower-builders.  But  those  tongues

designed  for  vengeance,  and  now  the  unison  of  tongues 
hath  been  renewed  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls.

revealed  the  fishermen  as  most  wise,  having  sent 

upon  them  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  through  them  thou  hast 

fished  the  universe,  O  Lover  of  mankind,  glory  to  thee.

i[^On  God  the  Lord  hath  appeared  unto  us,  sing  tJie  Troparion;  tlw/i 
the  following  Kathismata. 

First  Kathisma,  in  the  Fourth  Tone 

T  ET  us,  O  believers,  celebrate  with  joy  the  last  Feast, 
-*— '  which  is  also  the  last  of  the  Feast — Pentecost — 
which  is  the  end  and  fulfillment  of  the  preordained 
promise;  for  then  did  come  down  the  fire  of  the  Com- 
forter upon  the  earth  in  the  likeness  of  tongues,  lighting 
the  Disciples  and  revealing  them  plainly  as  initiates  of 
heavenly  things.  Verily,  the  light  of  the  Comforter 
hath  come  and  lighted  the  world. 

Second  Kathisma,  in  the  Same  Tone 

nr^HE  spring  of  the  Spirit  hath  come  to  those  on 
earth,  dividing  supersensuously  into  fire-bearing 
rivers,  moistening  the  Apostles  and  illuminating  them. 
The  fire  hath  become  to  them  a  dewy  cloud,  lighting, 
and  raining  flames  upon  them,  from  whom  we  received 
grace  by  the  fire  and  the  water.  Verily,  the  fire  of  the 
Comforter  hath  come  and  lighted  the  world. 

Third  Kathisma,  in  the  Eighth  Tone 

A  FTER  thy  rising  from  the  tomb,  O  Christ,  and  thy 
divine  ascent  to  the  celestial  heights,  thou  didst 
send  thy  glory,  O  compassionate  One,  to  thy  Godhead- 
seeing    Disciples,    renewing    in    them    a    right    spirit.

1.  Let  us  praise  him  who  overwhelmed  Pharaoh  and 
his  chariots  in  the  sea;  who  crusheth  wars  with  a  mighty 
hand;  for  he  hath  been  glorified. 

3.  Thou  didst  call  unto  thy  Disciples,  O  Christ,  say- 
ing. Stay  ye  in  Jerusalem  till  ye  be  endued  with  power 
from  on  high,  and  I  will  send  you  another  Comforter 
like  me,  who  is  my  Spirit  and  the  Spirit  of  the  Father, 
and  in  him  ye  shall  be  strengthened. 

4.  When  the  Prophet  perceived  thy  coming  in  the 
last  days,  O  Christ,  he  lifted  his  voice  crying,  I  have 
heard,  O  Lord,  the  hearing  of  thy  might;  for  thou  didst 
verily  come  to  save  all  thine  anointed  ones. 

5.  The  Spirit  of  salvation,  O  Lord,  who  for  fear  of 
thee  was  conceived  in  the  belly  of  the  Prophets  and 
wast  begotten  on  earth,  hath  created  the  hearts  of  the 
Apostles  pure,  being  renewed  in  the  faithful;  for  thy 
commands  are  light  and  peace. 

6.  My  soul  hath  been  stirred  with  the  agitation  of 
worldly  concerns.  Yea,  I  am  drowned  therein,  from  the 
sins  that  accompany  me,  and  cast  to  the  soul-corrupting 
beast.  Wherefore,  like  Jonah,  I  cry  unto  thee,  O 
Christ,  lift  me  out  of  the  mortifying  depth.

7.  The  righteous  youths  who  were  thrown  into  the 
furnace  of  fire,  changed  the  flames  into  dew  when  they 
lifted  their  voices  in  songs  of  praise,  crying  thus,  Blessed 
art  thou,  O  Lord  God  of  our  fathers. 

8.  The  unconsumed  bush  which  mingled  with  fire  in 
Sinai  made  God  known  to  the  heavy-tongued  and 
hoarse-voiced  Moses.  In  like  manner,  God's  zeal  man- 
ifested the  three  youths  as  unconsumed  by  fire,  but 
praising  thus,  Praise  the  Lord,  all  his  works,  and  exalt 
him  more  and  more  unto  the  ages. 

^/hid  instead  of  O  thou  who  art  more  honourable,  etc.  sing  the  fol- 
lowing Ninth  Ode  of  the  Pentecost  Canon,  in  the  Seventh  Tone. 

9.  O  Mother  that  hath  known  no  man,  thou  didst 
conceive,  not  experiencing  corruption,  lending  a  body 
to  the  Word,  the  Creator  of  all,  becoming  a  receptacle 
to  thine  insupportable  Creator,  a  dwelling-place  to 
thine  incomprehensible  Maker.  Wherefore,  O  virgin 
Theotokos,  thee  do  we  magnify. 

Of  old  the  fire-breathing,  zealous  Elijah  did  mount 
with  joy  the  all-flaming  chariot.  Wherefore,  this  sign 
did  explain  the  rising  of  the  gentle  breeze  illuminating 
the  Apostles  from  on  High,  through  which  they  were 
lighted,  making  known  to  all  the  Trinity. 

Strange  things  contrary  to  the  law  of  nature  are  now 
heard;  for  by  the  one  voice,  which  the  Disciples  re- 
ceived in  divers  kinds,  through  the  grace  of  the  Spirit, 
all  the  nations,  tribes,  and  tongues  heard  the  great  things 
of  God,  and  received  the  knowledge  of  the  Trinity. 

^And  the  following,  in  the  Fourth  Tone. 

Ty  EJOICE,  O  Queen,  pride  of  virgins  and  mothers; 
for  every  eloquent  and  capable  mouth  doth  fall 
short  of  extolling  thee  worthily,  and  every  mind  is  daz- 
zled at  the  understanding  of  the  manner  of  thy  birth- 
giving.    Wherefore,  in  unison  do  we  glorify  thee. 

Let  us  worthily  praise  the  Maiden  who  revived  na- 
ture, who  alone  did  screen  the  Word  in  her  womb,  the

right  hand  of  the  Father,  and  sent  the  grace  of  the 
Spirit.

Wherefore,  let  us  glorify  him.

wonders,  when  the  Holy  Spirit  descended  in  fiery 
tongues,  as  the  God-inspired  Luke  spake;  for  he  said, 
The  Disciples  of  Christ  being  gathered  together,  there 
was  a  sound  as  of  a  mighty  wind,  and  it  filled  the  whole 
house  where  they  were  sitting.  And  they  began  to  speak 
strange  doctrines  and  strange  teachings  with  divers 
tongues,  to  the  holy  Trinity.     {Repeat.) 

The  Holy  Spirit  hath  ever  been,  is  and  ever  shall 
be;  for  he  is  wholly  without  beginning  and  without  end. 
Yet  he  is  in  covenant  with  the  Father  and  the  Son,

Section  from  the  Acts  of  the  Saintly  and  Pure  Apostles 

(2:1-11) 

A  ND  when  the  days  of  the  Pentecost  were  accom- 
plished, they  were  all  together  in  one  place; 
And  suddenly  there  came  a  sound  from  heaven,  as  of 


Pentecost  lOOS 

a  mighty  wind  coming,  and  it  filled  the  whole  house 
where  they  were  sitting. 

And  there  appeared  to  them  parted  tongues  as  it 
were  of  fire,  and  it  sat  upon  every  one  of  them: 

And  they  were  all  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  and 
they  began  to  speak  with  divers  tongues,  according  as 
the  Holy  Ghost  gave  them  to  speak. 

Now  there  were  dwelling  at  Jerusalem,  Jews,  devout 
men,  out  of  every  nation  under  heaven. 

And  when  this  was  noised  abroad,  the  multitude  came 
together,  and  were  confounded  in  mind,  because  that 
every  man  heard  them  speak  in  his  own  tongue. 

And  they  were  all  amazed,  and  wondered,  saying: 
Behold,  are  not  all  these  that  speak,  Galileans? 

And  how  have  we  heard,  every  man  our  own  tongue 
wherein  we  were  born? 

Parthians,  and  Medes,  and  Elamites,  and  inhabitants 
of  Mesopotamia,  Judea,  and  Cappadocia,  Pontus  and 
Asia. 

Phrygia,  and  Pamphylia,  Egypt,  and  the  parts  of 
Libya  about  Cyrene,  and  strangers  of  Rome, 

Jews  also,  and  proselytes,  Cretes,  and  Arabians:  we 
have  heard  them  speak  in  our  own  tongues  the  wonder- 
ful works  of  God. 

The  Gospel:  from  St.  John  (7:37-52;  8:12) 

A  ND  on  the  last,  and  great  day  of  the  festivity,  Jesus 
^  stood  and  cried,  saying:  If  any  man  thirst,  let  him 
come  to  me  and  drink. 

He  that  believeth  in  me,  as  the  scripture  saith.  Out  of 
his  belly  shall  flow  rivers  of  living  water. 

Now  this  he  said  of  the  Spirit  which  they  should  re- 
ceive, who  believed  in  him:  for  as  yet  the  Spirit  was 
not  given,  because  Jesus  was  not  yet  glorified. 

Of  that  multitude  therefore,  when  they  had  heard 
these  words  of  his,  some  said  :  This  is  the  prophet  in- 
deed. 


1006  Pentecostarion 

Others  said  :  This  is  the  Christ.  But  some  said :  Doth 
the  Christ  come  out  of  Galilee? 

Doth  not  the  scripture  say:  That  Christ  cometh  of 
the  seed  of  David,  and  from  Bethlehem  the  town  where 
David  was? 

So  there  arose  a  dissension  among  the  people  because 
of  him. 

And  some  of  them  would  have  apprehended  him: 
but  no  man  laid  hands  upon  him. 

The  ministers  therefore  came  to  the  chief  priests  and 
the  Pharisees.  And  they  said  to  them:  Why  have  you 
not  brought  him? 

The  ministers  answered:  Never  did  man  speak  like 
this  man. 

The  Pharisees  therefore  answered  them :  Are  you 
also  seduced? 

Hath  any  one  of  the  rulers  believed  in  him,  or  of  the 
Pharisees? 

But  this  multitude,  that  knoweth  not  the  law,  are  ac- 
cursed. 

Nicodemus  said  to  them,  (he  that  came  to  him  by 
night,  who  was  one  of  them:) 

Doth  our  law  judge  any  man,  unless  it  first  hear  him, 
and  know  what  he  doeth? 

They  answered,  and  said  to  him:  Art  thou  also  a 
Galilean?  Search  the  scriptures,  and  see,  that  out  of 
Galilee  a  prophet  riseth  not. 

Again  therefore,  Jesus  spoke  to  them,  saying:  I  am 
the  light  of  the  world :  he  that  followeth  me,  walketh 
not  in  darkness,  but  shall  have  the  light  of  life. 

^And  on  Especially  sing,  O  Mother  that  hath  known  no  man,  etc. 
{p.  1002). 

Synaxarion 

A  FTER  the  Saviour's  ascent  to  heaven  the  eleven 

Apostles,  the  rest  of  the  Disciples,  the  pious  women 

who  were  accustomed  to  follow  him  from  the  begin- 

ing,    his   most   holy   Mother   the    Virgin    Mary,    and 


Pentecost  1007 

his  brothers  returned  from  the  Mount  of  Olives  to 
Jerusalem.  Altogether  they  were  about  one  hundred 
and  twenty  souls.  When  they  had  entered  the  house  in 
which  they  lived,  they  went  up  to  the  upper  room  to 
await  the  coming  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  according  to  the 
promise  of  their  divine  Master,  continuing  in  prayer 
and  supplication.  About  that  time  the  election  fell  on 
Matthias  who  was  counted  among  the  eleven  Apostles 
(see  August  ninth). 

On  a  corresponding  Sunday,  which  is  the  tenth  day 
after  the  Ascension,  and  the  fiftieth  after  the  Passover, 
falling  then  on  the  thirteenth  of  May,  about  the  third 
hour  of  the  day,  there  came  a  sound  from  heaven  as  of 
a  rushing  mighty  wind,  and  it  filled  all  the  house  where 
the  Apostles  were  sitting.  And  immediately  there  ap- 
peared to  them  cloven  tongues  like  as  of  fire,  and  sat 
upon  the  head  of  each  of  them.  And  all  those  who 
were  there  were  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  they 
began  to  speak,  not  with  the  tongues  of  their  ancestors, 
but  with  other  tongues  with  which  the  Holy  Spirit  sup- 
plied them  as  He  inspired  them. 

And  by  divine  provision,  there  were  gathered  in  Jeru- 
salem for  the  feast  great  multitudes  from  about  eighteen 
difl^erent  nations  and  tongues,  such  as  Parthians,  Medes, 
Elamites,  and  others,  who  were  all  Jews  by  race  and 
religion,  but,  because  they  had  been  born  and  brought 
up  in  various  places  among  strange  nations,  they  were 
dispersed  from  ancient  times,  and  each  was  called  after 
the  place  of  his  birth.  When  these  heard  the  sound 
from  heaven,  descending  to  where  the  Disciples  of 
Christ  were  gathered,  they  all  hastened  thither  to  find 
out  what  had  happened.  And  as  each  heard  the  Apos- 
tles speaking:  in  his  own  language,  they  were  all  amazed 
and  marvelled,  saying  one  to  another.  Behold,  are  not 
all  these  which  speak  Galileans?  And  how  hear  we 
every  man  in  our  own  tongue,  wherein  we  were  born? 

And  there  were  others  (perhaps  the  blind  Scribes  and 
Pharisees),  who,  because  of  their  great  wickedness  and 


1008  Pentecostarion 

folly,  mocked  the  miracle,  saying  that  the  Apostles  were 
drunk. 

Then  Peter,  standing  with  the  Eleven,  lifted  up  his 
voice  and  spake  before  the  multitude,  explaining  that 
what  had  happened  was  not  due  to  intoxication,  but  to 
the  fulfillment  of  God's  promise,  speaking  to  Joel, 
which  says,  And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in  the  last  days, 
I  will  pour  of  my  spirit  upon  all  flesh:  and  your  sons 
and  your  daughters  shall  prophesy,  etc.  (Acts  2:2-28). 
Then  he  preached  Jesus  the  Nazarene,  explaining  with 
many  proofs  that  he  was  Christ  the  Lord  whom  the 
Jews  crucified  and  whom  God  raised  from  the  dead. 

Many  then  were  touched  in  their  hearts  because  of 
his  words,  and,  accepting  them,  were  baptized.  And 
on  that  day  there  were  added  to  the  faithful  about  three 
thousand  souls.  (Acts  1  :1 2  to  2:41). 

This  then  is  the  object  of  the  present  Feast,  namely, 
the  coming  of  the  Holy  Spirit  into  the  world,  the  fulfill- 
ment of  the  promise  of  Jesus  Christ,  and  the  completion 
of  the  undefiled  Disciples'  hope.  It  is  the  sequel  and 
the  conclusion  of  the  Feasts  of  the  great  mystery  of  the 
divine  Incarnation.  On  the  day  corresponding  to  this 
day  of  salvation,  the  day  of  Pentecost,  the  Saviour's 
Apostles,  who  were  formerly  simple  fishermen  and  il- 
literate, were  suddenly  instructed  by  the  advent  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  becoming  possessed  of  the  greatest  wisdom 
and  speaking  plainly  of  heavenly  doctrines.  They  be- 
came preachers  of  truth  and  teachers  to  the  whole 
world.  From  that  day  they  began  the  work  of  their 
great  mission,  the  wonderful  and  delectable  first-fruit 
of  which  was  the  conversion  of  three  thousand  souls  on 
that  very  same  day. 

Some  hold  that  the  above  mentioned  upper  room, 
which  the  Jews  used  to  consider  a  place  of  worship 
and  prayer,  since  it  was  designated  for  that  purpose, 
was  the  same  upper  room  in  which  the  Saviour  deliv- 
ered the  divine  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist.  But  others 
jiold  that  it  was  in  the  house  of  John  the  Evangelist. 


Pentecost — Kneeling  Service  1009 

Still  others  think  it  was  in  the  house  of  Mary  the  mother 
of  John,  who  was  known  as  John  Mark  (Acts  12:12), 
where  afterwards  a  church  was  built  and  named  the 
Upper  Church  of  the  Apostles  (see  the  sixteenth  Ser- 
mon of  Cyril  of  Jerusalem).  Again,  there  are  others 
who  say  that  it  was  one  of  the  many  upper  rooms  in 
the  outer  court  of  the  Temple,  which  were  open  to 
people  who  were  gathered  in  the  Temple,  and  prepared 
for  those  who  cared  to  enter  them.  They  cite  as  proof 
of  their  claim  the  words  of  St.  Luke,  And  they  were 
continually  in  the  Temple,  praising  and  blessing  God 
(St.  Lk.  24:53).  It  may  also  be  noted  here  that  the 
name  of  Mary  the  Theotokos  is  mentioned  at  this  point 
for  the  last  time  in  the  New  Testament.

r\  PURE  and  blameless  Lord,  who  art  without  be-

able, unchangeable, immeasurable,  and  unbounded, who 
art  without  evil  and  alone  immortal,  who  dwellest  in 
the  unapproachable  light.  Maker  of  heaven  and  earth 
and  the  seas  and  all  that  was  created  therein,  who  grant-

and  of  thee  we  ask,  O  philanthropic  Master,  the  Father 
of  our  Lord  and  God  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ,  who  for 
us  men  and  for  our  salvation  came  down  from  heaven 
and  was  incarnate  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  of  the  ever- 
virgin  Mary,  the  noble  Theotokos;  who  first  did  teach

by  word,  and  at  last  manifested  in  deed;  who,  having 
borne  the  saving  Passion,  granted  us  thine  unworthy, 
sinful,  and  miserable  servants,  a  command  and  exam- 
ple that  we  should  offer  our  supplication  with  bending 
of  the  neck  and  the  knees  for  our  sins  and  the  ignor- 
ances of  the  people.  Wherefore,  O  most  merciful  and 
philanthropic  Lord,  hear  us  on  whatever  day  we  call 
upon  thee,  and  especially  on  this  day  of  Pentecost, 
whereon,  after  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  had  ascended  into 
heaven  and  sat  on  thy  right  hand,  O  God  and  Father, 
he  sent  down  the  Holy  Spirit  to  his  Disciples,  the  holy 
Apostles,  who  alighted  on  each  of  them  and  filled  them 
all  with  his  inexhaustible  and  divine  grace;  and  they 
did  speak  in  strange  tongues,  prophesying  thy  great 
deeds.  Hear  us  who  beseech  thee,  and  remember  us, 
wretched  and  condemned.  Restore  us  from  the  captiv- 
ity of  our  souls,  w^hose  intercessor  with  thee  is  thine  own 
lovingkindness.  Accept  us  who  kneel  down  before  thee 
and  cry  out  unto  thee.  We  have  sinned  against  thee, 
and  upon  thee  were  we  thrown  even  from  our  mother's 
womb.  Thou  art  our  God,  but  having  passed  our  days 
in  vanity  we  have  been  stripped  of  thine  aid,  and  have 
been  deprived  of  every  defence.  Yet  do  we  trust  in 
thy  compassion  and  cry  unto  thee,  Remember  not  the 
sins  of  our  youth  and  ignorance;  cleanse  us  of  our  se- 
cret sins.  Reject  us  not  in  our  old  age,  and  forsake  us 
not  at  the  dissolution  of  our  strength.  And  before  we 
return  to  the  earth,  prepare  us  to  return  to  thee.  With 
bountiful  pity  hearken  thou  unto  us.  Over  against  our 
iniquities  set  thy  compassion,  and  against  our  transgres- 
sions the  abyss  of  thy  lovingkindness.  Look  down  from 
the  height  of  thy  holiness  upon  thy  people  who  stand 
and  await  from  thee  abundant  mercy.  Visit  us  with 
thy  goodness  and  deliver  us  from  the  possession  of  Dia- 
bolus,  and  preserve  our  life  with  thy  holy  and  solemn 
laws.  Commit  thy  people  unto  a  faithful  and  guardian 
angel.  Gather  us  all  unto  thy  kingdom,  and  grant  re- 
mission of  sins  to  those  who  put  their  trust  in  thee,  and 
forgive  us  and  them  our  sins.    Purify  us  by  the  opera-

Pentecost — Kneeling  Service  101.1 

Spirit,  an  inheritance  that  shall  never  be  taken  away 
from  us;  who  on  this  day  didst  direct  and  send  this 
grace  openly  upon  thy  Disciples,  the  Apostles;  who 
didst  place  in  their  mouths  and  upon  their  lips  tongues 
of  fire,  through  which  we,  together  with  all  mankind, 
have  received  the  knowledge  of  God  by  the  hearing  of 
the  ear,  each  in  his  own  tongue,  and  have  been  illumi- 
nated by  the  light  of  the  Spirit,  being^  emancipated  from 
error  as  from  darkness;  and  by  the  distribution  of  the 
material  tongues  of  fire  and  their  supernatural  effect; 
we  have  become  Disciples  to  thee  by  believing  in  thee; 
and  having  been  enlightened,  discoursed  on  thy  God- 
head; for  thou,  with  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit, 
art  one  Godhead,  one  Power,  and  one  Authority. 
Wherefore,  O  Splendour  of  the  Father,  the  Likeness 
of  his  Essence,  his  immutable  and  unchangeable  Na- 
ture, thou  art  the  Fountain  of  salvation  and  grace. 
Open  my  lips,  sinner  that  I  am,  and  teach  me  how  and 
for  whom  I  should  pray;  for  thou  dost  know  the  multi- 
tude of  my  sins,  but  thine  unbounded  compassion  doth 
overcome  the  enormity  thereof.  Behold,  I  come  and 
stand  before  thee  in  fear  and  dismay,  casting  my  souPs 
despair  into  the  depth  of  thy  mercy.  Ordain  my  life, 
O  thou  who  ordainest  the  whole  creation  by  thine  un- 
utterable Word,  and  by  the  power  of  thine  ineffable 
wisdom,  O  tranquil  Haven  to  those  who  are  caught  in 
the  rages  of  winter,  and  make  known  to  me  the  way  in 
which  I  should  walk.  Grant  to  my  thoughts  the  spirit 
of  thy  wisdom,  and  bestow  upon  mine  ignorance  the 
spirit  of  thine  understanding.  Overshadow  my  acts 
with  the  spirit  of  thy  fear;  a  right  spirit  create  thou 
within  me,  and  by  thy  sovereign  Spirit  strengthen  thou 
mine  unstable  mind,  that  I  may  be  worthy  each  day  to 
do  thy  com.mandments,  being  guided  by  thy  righteous 
Spirit  into  that  which  is  profitable,  ever  mindful  of  thy 
glorified  Coming  that  searcheth  our  life's  deeds.  Let 
me  not  be  led  astray  by  the  corrupting  pleasure  of  this 
world,  but  strengthen  me  to  delight  in  the  treasures  to 
come.     For  thou,  O  Master,  didst  say  that,  whatever 


1014  Pentecostarion 

ye  ask  in  my  Name  ye  shall  receive  from  God  the 
Father,  coeternal  with  thee.  Wherefore,  I  a  sinner,  im- 
plore thy  goodness  for  the  coming  of  thy  Holy  Spirit. 
Grant  thou  my  request  for  salvation:  yea,  good  Lord, 
who  grantest  all  riches  and  benevolence;  for  thou  art 
he  who  grantest  us  more  than  we  ask,  the  merciful  and 
pitying,  who  hast  become  a  Partaker  with  us  in  the  flesh 
without  sin.  Thou  art  he  who,  for  his  love  to  mankind, 
dost  have  compassion  on  those  who  bend  the  knee  to 
thee,  having  become  an  offering  for  our  sins.  Grant, 
Lord,  thy  compassion  to  thy  people,  and  incline  thine 
ear  to  us  from  the  heaven  of  thy  holiness;  sanctify  them 
by  the  saving  might  of  thy  right  hand,  shield  them  with 
the  shelter  of  thy  wings,  and  turn  not  away  from  the 
works  of  thy  hands.  Against  thee  only  have  we  sinned, 
yet  thee  only  have  we  worshipped.  A  strange  God  we 
have  not  learned  to  worship,  nor  did  we  lift  our  hands 
to  another  God.  Pardon  our  iniquities,  O  Master,  and 
accept  our  beseechings  with  the  bending  of  the  knees. 
Extend  to  us  all  a  helping  hand,  and  accept  our  whole 
prayer  as  acceptable  incense  rising  before  thy  most 
righteous  kingdom. 

^Then  immediately  this  Prayer  by  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

T  ORD,  Lord,  thou  who  hast  delivered  us  from  every 
arrow  that  flieth  by  day,  save  us  from  everything 
that  walketh  in  darkness,  and  accept  the  lifting  up  of 
our  hands  as  an  evening  offering.  Prepare  us  to  pass 
the  distance  of  night  blameless  and  untempted  by  evils. 
Deliver  us  from  Satan.  Grant  our  souls  reverence,  and 
our  thoughts  concern  to  search  thy  just,  terrible,  judg- 
ment. Pierce  our  bodies  with  thy  fear,  and  mortify 
our  members  that  are  on  earth,  that  in  the  stillness  of 
the  night  we  may  be  lighted  by  the  contemplation  of 
thy  precepts.  Drive  from  us  every  evil  imagining  and 
harmful  passion,  and  raise  us  in  time  of  prayer,  estab- 
lished in  the  Faith,  and  prospering  in  thy  command- 
ments.

^^  giving,  illuminating,  creative  Power,  coeternal

dispensation  in  a  manner  transcending  beauty;  didst 
tear  apart  the  indestructible  bonds  of  death,  break 
asunder  the  bolts  of  hades,  and  tread  down  the  multitude 
of  evil  spirits,  offering  thyself  a  blameless  Sacrifice  and 
offering  us  thy  pure,  spotless,  and  sinless  body:  who, 
for  this  ineffable  and  dread  service,  didst  grant  us  life 
everlasting,  O  thou  who  didst  descend  into  hades,  and 
demolish  the  eternal  bars,  revealing  an  ascent  to  those 
who  are  in  the  lower  abode ;  who  with  the  bait  of  divine 
wisdom  didst  entice  the  dragon,  the  head  of  subtle  evil, 
binding  him  in  Tartarus  with  abysmal  bonds,  un- 
quenchable fire,  and  outer  darkness;  through  thine  in- 
finite power,  O  Wisdom  of  the  Father,  thou  of  great 
Name  who  dost  manifest  thyself  a  great  Helper  to  those 
who  are  in  distress;  a  luminous  Light  to  those  who  sit 
in  darkness  and  the  shadow  of  death;  thou  art  the  Lord

the  living  and  appointest  the  time  for  the  dead;  who 
bringest  down  to  hades  and  raisest  to  bliss;  who  bindest 
with    weakness    and    loosest    with    power;    who    dis- 
posest  the  future  as  is  meet;  who  workest  life  through 
hope  of  resurrection  to  those  who  are  smitten  with  the 
arrows  of  death;  thou  art  the  Master  of  all,  our  God 
and  our  Saviour,  O  hope  of  all  the  ends  of  the  earth 
and  of  those  who  are  away  on  the  seas,  O  thou  who  on 
this  last  and  great  day  of  salvation,  the  day  of  the  Feast 
of  Pentecost,  hast  revealed  to  us  the  mystery  of  the  holy 
Trinity,  consubstantial  and  coeternal,  indivisible  and 
immiscible,  who  didst  overflow  upon  thine  undefiled 
Apostles  with  thy  Holy  Spirit,  life-giving  in  his  de- 
scent and  in  his  presence,  in  the  likeness  of  tongues  of 
fire,  revealing  them  as  proclaimers  of  the  true  Faith, 
making  of  them  true  confessors  and  preachers  of  the

2:rantest  us  great  hope  that  unto  the  dead,  held  in  the 
bondage  of  grief,  thou  shalt  send  rest  and  consolation

place,  a  place  of  verdure  and  rest,  where  there  is  no  sor- 
row of  any  kind,  nor  suffering  nor  sighs.    Array  their 
souls  in  the  tabernacles  of  the  righteous,  and  make  them 
worthy  of  peace  and  repose;  for  it  is  not  the  dead  who 
praise  thee,  O  Lord,  nor  do  those  who  are  in  hades  ven-

^  ders  to  all;  for  the  Jews,  of  whom  cometh  Christ 
after  the  flesh,  were  divided  by  lack  of  faith.  They  fell 
from  the  divine  grace  and  the  divine  light  which  we, 
the  Gentiles,  have  attained,  who  are  established  by  the 
sayings  of  the  Disciples,  giving  utterance  to  the  glory 
of  God,  the  All-benefactor,  with  whom  we  bend  our 
hearts  as  well  as  our  knees,  and  worship  the  Holy  Spirit 
in  faith,  being  strengthened  by  the  Saviour  of  our  souls.

Stic  has:    Create  a  clean  heart  in  me,  O  God. 

Now  the  comforting  Spirit  hath  been  poured  on  all 
flesh;  for,  starting  with  the  rank  of  the  Apostles,  he 
extended  grace  through  the  communion  of  believers, 
certifying  his  effective  presence  by  the  distribution  of 
tongues  to  the  Disciples  in  fiery  likeness  for  the  praise 
of  God  and  his  glory.  Wherefore,  being  supersensu- 
ously  illumined  with  them  and  confirmed  in  the  stead- 
fast Faith,  we  beseech  the  Holy  Spirit  to  save  our  souls. 

Stichos:    Cast  me  not  away  from  thy  face. 

The  Apostles  of  Christ  have  put  on  might  and  power 
from  above;  for  the  Comforter  hath  renewed  them,  and 
in  them  renewed  the  knowledge  of  the  new  mysteries 
which  they  proclaimd  to  us  in  tones  and  resounding 
words,  teaching  us  to  worship  the  all-bountiful  God  of 
simple,  eternal  Nature  of  three  Persons.  Wherefore, 
being  illumined  by  their  teachings,  let  us  worship  the 
Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit,  beseeching  them  to  save 
our  souls.

€[^0n  O  Lord,  to  thee  have  I  cried,  sing  Six  for  the  Resurrection,  in 
the  Eighth  Tone;  and  the  follozving  four  for  All  Saints. 

THHE  Spirit-proclaiming  Disciples  of  the  Saviour, 
having  become,  through  faithfulness,  instruments 
of  the  Spirit,  and  being  scattered  to  the  ends  of  the 
earth,  sowed  in  steadfastness  of  opinion  the  solemn 
warning,  and  from  their  divine  husbandry  blossomed 
forth  unto  grace  the  army  of  Martyrs,  who  inscribed 
the  signs  of  the  noble  passions  by  sundry  kinds  of  tor- 
tures, scourgings,  and  fire.  Verily,  as  favoured  ones, 
they  plead  for  our  souls. 

The  venerable  Martyrs,  fired  by  the  Lord's  love,  de- 
spised the  fire;  and  bein^  consumed  as  divine  live  coals, 
they  burned,  through  Christ,  the  dried  grass  of  the  ar- 
rogance of  error;  bridled  the  mouths  of  beasts  with 


1022  Pentecostarion 

their  own  befitting  supplications;  and,  being  beheaded, 
they  themselves  beheaded  all  the  hosts  of  the  enemy. 
Yea,  having  dauntlessly  shed  their  blood,  they  watered 
the  firm  Church  with  faith. 

Verily,  the  heroic  Martyrs  having  wrestled  with 
beasts,  were  torn  by  their  claws.  They  were  cut  up 
with  swords,  their  arms  were  dislocated,  and  their  mem- 
bers writhed  with  the  pain  of  arrow  wounds.  They 
were  consumed  with  material  fire,  dismembered  and 
prodded  wnth  lances.  All  this  they  bore  magnanimous- 
ly when  they  foresaw  their  approaching  end,  the  un- 
withering  crowns,  and  the  glory  of  Christ,  whom,  as 
favoured  ones,  they  implore  for  our  souls. 

Dutifully  and  with  songs  of  praise  let  us  extol  the 
noble  assembly  of  the  Apostles,  Martyrs,  Godly-mind- 
ed Priests,  and  noble  women  who  fought  with  faith 
in  all  the  ends  of  the  earth;  for,  being  earthly,  they 
united  with  the  heavenly  ones;  and  by  their  passions 
attained  passionlessness  by  the  grace  of  Christ.  And 
lo,  as  constant  luminaries  they  illuminate  us,  and  as 
favoured  ones,  plead  for  our  souls. 

Glory,  in  the  Sixth  Tone 

"Y^E  are  the  pillars  of  the  Church  and  the  fulfillment

ye  have  fulfilled  the  sayings  of  the  Saviour;  for  through 
vou  the  gates  of  hades,  opened  against  the  Church,  have 
been  closed;  and  your  shed  blood  dried  up  the  liba- 
tions of  the  idols.  And  having  nourished  the  perfec- 
tion of  believers  through  your  slaughter,  ye  dazzled 
the  incorporals,  standing  before  Christ  wearing  your 
crowns.  Wherefore,  intercede  ye  ceaselessly  with  him

1024  Pentecostarion 

A/'ERILY,  the  Lord  hath  made  his  Saints  on  earth  a 
wonder,  in  that  they  accept  his  stigmata,  and  his 
Passion  in  the  flesh,  adorning  themselves  therewith. 
Plainly  they  regaled  themselves  with  his  divine  benev- 
olences, whom  we  extol  as  unfading  flowers  and  fixed 
stars  of  the  Church,  voluntary,  bloody  sacrifices. 

Stichos:  The  just  cried,  and  the  Lord  heard  them. 

Let  us  extol  with  divine  songs  of  praise  the  assembly

Martyrs  among  Priests,  yea,  all  the  God-fearing,  and 
the  ranks  of  holy  women  who  strove  and  eagerly  lived

dwellers  in  paradise. 

Stichos:    Marvelous  is  God  in  his  Saints. 

Let  us  extol  the  Martyrs  who  made  earth  like  unto 
heaven  with  excellent  virtues,  who  emulated  the  death 
of  Christ  which  brought  about  deathlessness,  who 
walked  in  the  narrow  way  and  cured  the  sufferings  of 
mankind  with  the  medicine  of  grace,  who  bravely  strove

Synaxariox 

T^AVID  the  Prophet  and  king  who  revered  the  be- 
^^  loved  of  God  and  respected  them  because  of  his 
great  piety,  said,  How  precious  are  thy  beloved  unto 
me,  O  God  (Ps.  138:17).  And  the  divine  Apostle, 
having  recounted  the  deeds  of  the  saints  and  reviewed 
their  memory  that  they  might  serve  as  examples  for  us 
in  their  patience,  their  perseverance  in  persecutions, 
their  virtues,  their  contempt  for  sin,  and  their  turning 
away  from  worldly  things,  said.  Wherefore,  seeing  we 
also  are  compassed  about  with  so  great  a  cloud  of  wit- 
nesses, let  us  lay  aside  every  weight,  and  the  sin  that  doth 
so  easily  beset  us,  and  let  us  run  with  patience  the  race 
that  is  set  before  us  (Heb.  12:1). 

In  pursuance,  therefore,  of  the  teachings  of  the  divine 
Scriptures  and  apostolic  traditions,  we  also,  a  people  of 
piety  and  of  true  worship,  honour  the  beloved  saints  of 
God,  respecting  them  as  keepers  of  God's  command- 
ments, shining  examples  of  virtue,  and  benefactors  of 
human  nature.  We  honour  every  one  of  the  known 
saints  on  a  special  day  of  the  year,  as  may  be  discovered 
from  the  famous  list  of  saints.  But  since  their  number 
has  increased  many-fold  at  various  times,  still  increases, 
and  will  increase  continually  to  the  end  of  the  world, 
and  since  the  names  of  many  of  them  have  escaped  us, 
the  Church  designates  one  day  in  the  year  on  which 
is  celebrated  the  memory  of  all  the  saints,  which  is  this 
day,  on  which  we  piously  beatify  and  honour  all  the 
righteous,  the  Prophets,  the  Martyrs,  Confessors, 
Bishops,  teachers,  and  pious  ones,  all  those  who  were 
counted  and  are  counted  among  those  who  spent  their 
lives  in  piety  and  true  worship, glorifyingGod  with  their 


1026  Pentecostarion 

deeds,  whether  men  or  women,  known  or  unknown,  and 
on  this  day  we  also  honour  the  hosts  of  angels,  and  es- 
pecially our  Lady  the  ever-virgin  Theotokos,  putting 
their  lives  before  our  eyes  as  an  example  and  a  model 
of  virtue,  petitioning  them  to  intercede  with  God  for 
us,  that  his  grace  and  his  boundless  mercy  be  with  us 
all.    Amen. 

Koinonikon:  Praise  ye  the  Lord  from  the  heavens. 
Rejoice  in  the  Lord,  O  ye  just:  Praise  becometh  the 
upright.    Alleluia.

THE  CHURCH 

The  word  Ekklesia,  Church  from  which  the  English 
word  ecclesiastical  is  derived,  comes  from  the  Greek 
word  kalein,  to  call,  combined  with  the  Greek  prefix 
ek,  meaning  to  call  out.  In  its  general  sense  it  meant 
a  crowd  of  people  called  together  at  one  place  for  some 
purpose.  In  this  sense  the  ancient  Greeks  used  it  to 
signify  public  gatherings.  In  the  more  restricted  sense 
it  means  two  things:  the  congregation  of  the  faithful, 
wherever  found  in  all  parts  of  the  world ;  of  those  found 
in  one  diocese,  or  one  city,  as  in  Isidore  of  Pelusum, 
where  he  says  of  the  Church  that,  'Tt  is  the  multitude 
of  the  saints,  embraced  by  Orthodox  faith  and  good  con- 
duct." ^  And  said  St.  Eubius  in  a  more  extensive  sense, 
^'It  is  the  people  who  believe  in  Christ."  It  also  means 
the  place  or  house  where  the  grave  multitude  of  the 
faithful  meet,  discharging  their  obligations  of  religion 
and  worship  to  God.  The  first  connotation,  which  is  the 
true  one,  is  the  one  we  shall  employ  here.  The  second 
is  a  figurative  sense,  applying:  the  name  of  the  place 
to  those  who  occupy  it,  as  in  the  Holy  Bible. ^  But  the 
conclusive  and  definite  meaning  of  the  word  is,  ''The 
multitude  of  those  who  admit  and  confess  faith  in 
Christ,  an  Orthodox  and  single  faith,  united  in  com- 
munion in  particular  Sacraments,  governed  by  spiritual, 
canonical  pastors,  with  Christ  Himself  as  their  Head."

1028  Appendices 

Divisions  of  the  Church 

The  Church  is  divided  into  the  '^Teaching  Church," 
consisting  of  pastors,  teachers,  and  their  assistants, 
whom  Eusebius  calls  the  ''rank  of  the  saints,"  and  the 
"Learning  Church,"  consisting  of  the  faithful  who  live 
under  the  management  of  those  spiritual  pastors,  and 
whom  Eusebius  calls  ''rank  of  the  submitting."  ^  There 
is  another  division,  into  the  "Church  Militant,"  and 
the  "Church  Triumphant."  The  first  is  the  totality  of 
the  striving  faithful  on  this  earth,  and  the  latter  is  the 
rank  of  the  glorified  faithful  in  heaven,  as  St.  Macarius 
the  Great  said  (First  Discourse). 

We  may  here  state  the  distinguishing  signs  of  the 
true  Church,  which  is  in  truth  the  Body  of  Christ. 

Marks  of  the  True  Church 

The  signs  and  attributes  which  the  true  Orthodox 
Church  of  Christ  possesses  and  takes  pride  in  are  those 
plainly  and  explicitly  recorded  in  the  Holy  Bible  and 
in  the  Confession  of  Faith,  which  was  partly  of  the 
authorship  of  the  First  Ecumenical  Council  of  Nicea, 
and  partly  that  of  the  Second  Ecumenical  Council  held 
in  Constantinople.  These  Marks  are  four:  Unity, 
Holiness,  Catholicity  (universality),  and  Apostolicity. 
Said  the  Confession,  "And  in  One,  Catholic,  Holy,  and 
Apostolic  Church."     Let  us  examine  each  separately. 

Unity 

By  the  Unity  of  the  Church  we  understand  that  all 
the  faithful,  scattered  over  all  the  face  of  the  earth, 
from  one  body  or  entity,  or  Orthodox  opinion,  confess- 
ing one  faith,  pressing  towards  one  aim  unto  salvation. 
Hence  the  Church  must  have  two  things  before  that 
oneness  is  realized.  The  first  is  the  agreement  and 
unity  of  Orthodox  doctrine;  the  second  is  the  brother- 
hood of  the  faithful  everywhere  and  their  unity,  as  one 

1  Evangelical   Proof   (Cap.    17:2).

Appendices  1029 

body,  especially  of  the  honoured  pastors,  preserving 
outwardly  the  canonically  instituted  rules  of  deserving 
submission  and  homage,  and  inwardly  united  by  the 
unity  of  faith.  The  center  of  this  unity  is  Christ,  the 
head  of  the  Church.  The  Holy  Scriptures  declare 
plainly  this  unity  of  faith,  where  it  is  written,  ''En- 
deavouring to  keep  the  unity  of  the  Spirit  in  the  bond 
of  peace.  There  is  one  body,  and  one  Spirit,  even  as 
ye  are  called  in  one  hope  of  your  calling.  One  Lord, 
one  faith,  one  baptism,  one  God  and  Father  of  all,  who 
is  above  all,  and  through  all,  and  in  you  all."  ^  And 
again,  "For  as  the  body  is  one,  and  hath  many  members, 
and  all  the  members  of  that  one  body,  being  many,  are 
one  body,  so  also  is  Christ.  For  by  one  Spirit  are  we 
all  baptized  into  one  body,  whether  we  be  Jews  or  Gen- 
tiles, w^hether  we  be  bond  or  free;  and  have  been  all 
made  to  drink  into  one  Spirit."^ 

The  Holy  Fathers  are  equally  explicit  and  clear. 
Thus  St.  Clement  of  /Alexandria  says,  "The  Church  is 
one,  true,  of  ancient  verity,  in  which  are  counted  those 
of  upright  intentions.  And  since  God  is  one  and  the 
Lord  is  one,  the  inestimable  thing  is  praised  by  its  sin- 
gleness, because  it  resembles  the  one  principle.  And 
since  the  Church  belongs  to  One,  She  is  naturally  One, 
even  if  all  heresies  should  rise  against  her  to  break  her 
up.  She  is,  as  we  say  of  her,  one  ancient  Church,  Cath- 
olic in  her  nature,  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  belief, 
origin,  and  sublimity."  ^ 

And  in  his  149th  Discourse,  of  his  bound  Discourses, 
St.  Chrysostom  says,  "In  the  cities  and  villages  are 
numerous  churches.  But  the  Church  is  one;  for  the 
Christ  who  is  present  in  them  all  is  one,  perfect,  and 
indivisible."  And  in  the  First  Discourse  of  his  Com- 
mentary on  First  Corinthians,  he  also  says,  "The 
Church  is  God's  united  and  one,  not  only  in  Corinth 
but  in  all  the  inhabited  earth.  Separation  cannot  be 
understood  from  the  name  Ecclesia,  for  it  is  a  name 

1  Eph.  4:3-6.     -  1  C:()r.    12:12-13.     -M   Stromata  7,  p.   765. 


1030  Appendices 

for  unity  and  brotherhood."  And  again  in  the  Second 
Discourse  of  his  Commentary  on  Second  Corinthians 
he  says,  "We  must  all  seek  shelter  in  the  Church,  be- 
cause she  is  one  home  for  us  all,  and  behave  as  it  is 
proper  for  us  to  do;  for  we  are  one  body,  since  Baptism 
is  one,  the  Table  is  one,  the  Fountain  is  one,  the  crea- 
tion is  one,  and  the  Father  is  one." 

Of  similar  import  are  the  words  in  the  letter  of  Theo- 
dorite.  Bishop  of  Cyr,  to  King  Constantine  the  Great, 
''God  willed  it  and  there  was  his  One  and  Catholic 
Church.  True,  her  branches  have  spread  to  many 
places,  but  she  lives  and  grows  by  one  Spirit,  according 
to  the  divine  will."^ 

And  Epiphanius,  Archbishop  of  Cyprus,  speaking  of 
the  thirty-first  hersey,  said,  ''Though  the  Church  be 
scattered  all  over  the  earth,  to  the  furthermost  parts, 
she  keeps  the  glad  tidings  diligently  as  though  dwelling 
in  one  house.  Thus  the  churches  in  Germany  did  not 
believe  in  anything  different,  nor  were  they  taught  any- 
thing different,  neither  the  churches  that  are  in  Kurgia, 
in  Cilicia  (northern  Thrace),  in  the  lands  of  the  rising 
sun,  or  those  in  Egypt,  or  in  Libya,  or  the  churches 
founded  at  the  extreme  parts  of  the  inhabited  world. 
But  in  every  place  the  gospel  of  salvation  shines  forth 
by  its  ownself  as  the  God-created  sun  illuminates  the 
whole  world,  yet  being  one  himself." 

"All  they  whose  hope  is  in  Christ,"  said  Basil  the 
Great,  "are  one  people;  and  the  Christians  today  are 
one  Church,  though  called  after  many  countries."  '^ 
And  Theophlactus,  commenting  on  the  first  chapter  of 
the  First  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians,  also  said,  "All  the 
faithful  are  one  Church,  wherever  they  are,  and  wher- 
ever they  happen  to  be." 

And  the  sainted  Martyr  Cyprian,  who  lived  in  the 
middle  of  the  third  century,  said,  in  a  special  Epistle 
he  wrote  on  the  unity  of  the  Church,  "He  who  cannot 
call  the   Church   his   mother,   cannot  make   God   his

Father.  And  if  it  could  not  be  possible  for  one  outside 
Noah's  ark  to  survive,  it  could  not  be  possible  for  one 
outside  the  Church's  gates  to  be  saved." 

And  the  beatified  Augustine,  in  his  discussion  of  the 
unity  of  the  Church,  (Cap  19)  says,  ''He  for  whom 
Christ  is  not  head,  cannot  attain  salvation  for  himself, 
and  eternal  life.  Nor  can  one  make  Christ  his  head  un- 
less he  joins  the  body  of  Christ,  w^hich  is  the  Church." 

Now  since  the  Church  is  one,  and  that  oneness  con- 
sists primarily  and  universally  of  perfect  agreement  in 
Orthodox  doctrines,  it  necessarily  follows  that  all  those 
who  do  not  conform  to  those  Orthodox  doctrines,  whe- 
ther by  addition  or  omission,  or  by  any  innovation  of 
their  own,  thus  changing  the  truth,  are  outside  this  one 
Holy  Church,  as  one  may  also  ascertain  from  a  review 
of  the  sixth  and  seventh  canons  of  the  Second  Ecumen- 
ical Council,  and  the  first  canon  of  St.  Basil  the  Great. 

Catholicity 

The  word  Catholicity  comes  from  the  Greek  katholo, 
a  compound  word  consisting  of  kata  a  Greek  preposi- 
tion of  many  meanings,  and  the  Greek  noun  holos, 
meaning  whole.  It  is  an  adverbial  word  signifying 
universality,  and  from  it  the  word  katholikos  is  derived, 
as  also  the  feminine,  katholike.  Thus  the  term  Katho- 
like  Ekklesia,  means  universal,  or  unrestricted  Church. 

The  Christian  Church,  therefore,  was  called  Catholic 
because,  first,  she  was  not  intended  to  be  confined  to 
one  place,  time,  or  nation;  and,  secondly,  because  she 
comprises  and  embraces  wholly  all  the  correct  teach- 
ing, propagated  in  all  parts  of  the  inhabited  world, 
through  transmission  from  the  Apostles,  and  preserved 
at  all  times  and  by  all  peoples  as  received  by  her  and 
as  taught  to  her  children  for  salvation.  She  is  also  in 
agreement  on  doctrine,  rites,  and  church  polity,  with- 
out dissension. 

In  the  first  meaning  the  Christian  Church  differs  from 
the  Jewish,  in  that  God's  law  in  the  Old  Covenant  was 


1032  Appendices 

restricted  to  the  Jewish  people.  The  Church  of  God 
was  exclusively  confined  to  that  nation.  And  because 
the  worship  of  the  true  God,  the  offering  of  sacrifices, 
and  the  other  Jewish  rites,  or  worship,  were  restricted 
to  Jerusalem,  and  hence  the  Church  of  God  was  lim- 
ited in  space  to  that  place,  and  because  the  Jewish 
Church  was  restricted  in  time,  too,  ending  with  the 
coming  of  Christ,  the  Saviour  Jesus  Christ  (may  his 
Name  be  worshipped)  came  and  gave  us  a  Catholic 
Church,  not  confined  in  place  as  at  Jerusalem,  nor  re- 
stricted in  time,  as  to  the  period  before  his  coming,  nor 
the  property  of  one  nation,  as  the  Jewish. 

In  confirmation  of  this  the  glorified  Master  said,  by 
the  mouth  of  his  Prophet  Isaiah,  ''And  it  shall  come 
to  pass  in  the  last  days,  that  the  mountain  of  the  Lord's 
house  shall  be  established  in  the  top  of  the  mountains, 
and  shall  be  exalted  above  the  hills;  and  all  nations  shall 
flow  unto  it.  And  many  people  shall  go  and  say;  Come 
ye,  and  let  us  go  up  to  the  mountain  of  the  Lord,  to  the 
house  of  God  of  Jacob;  and  he  will  teach  us  of  his 
ways."  ^  And  again  in  his  Prophet  Malachi,  ''For, 
from  the  rising  of  the  sun  even  unto  the  going  down  of 
the  same,  my  name  shall  be  great  among  the  Gentiles; 
and  in  every  place  incense  shall  be  ofifered  unto  my 
name,  and  a  pure  offering."  ^  And  he  himself  (may 
he  be  praised  and  glorified)  said  plainly  to  his  Dis- 
ciples, "Go  ye  therefore  and  teach  all  nations.  Go  ye 
into  all  the  world,  and  preach  the  Gospel  to  every  crea- 
ture." ''  And  again  he  said,  "But  ye  shall  receive  power, 
after  that  the  Holy  Spirit  is  come  upon  you:  and  ye 
shall  be  witnesses  unto  me  both  in  Jerusalem,  and  in  all 
Judaea,  and  in  Samaria,  and  unto  the  uttermost  part  of 
the  earth."  ^  This  is  explained  further  by  his  beloved 
Disciple  in  the  Book  of  Revelation,  speaking  by  the 
mouth  of  the  elders,  "Thou  art  worthy  to  take  the  book, 
and  to  open  the  seals  thereof :  for  thou  wast  slain,  and 
hast  redeemed  us  to  God  by  thy  blood  out  of  every  kin- 

Us.  2:2-3.       -'Mai.  1:11.       'i  St.  Matt.  28: 19;  St.  Mark.  16:1. S.      4  Acts  1  :8

(Ircd,  and  tongue,  and  people  and  nation/''  Also, 
"After  this  I  beheld,  and  lo,  a  great  multitude,  which 
no  man  could  number,  of  all  nations,  and  kindreds,  and 
people,  and  tongues,  stood  before  the  throne.''  - 

In  this  sense  St.  Cyril  of  Jerusalem  wrote,  '^She  (the 
Church)  is  called  Catholic  because  of  her  existence 
throughout  the  inhabited  world.""'  Similarly  St.  Ath- 
anasius  the  Great,  "The  Church  is  called  Catholic 
because  she  is  spread  throughout  all  the  world."  ^  And 
Theophlactus,  commenting  on  the  twelfth  chapter  of 
the  First  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians,  'The  Catholic 
Church  is  the  one  found  in  all  the  inhabited  world, 
whose  body  is  the  churches  of  the  various  climes,  and 
whose  head  is  Christ." 

So  much  for  the  catholicity  of  space.  But  the  Church 
is  Catholic  in  more  than  that  sense.  In  the  temporal 
sense  the  Catholicity  of  the  Church  indicates  her  exist- 
ence from  the  time  she  was  founded  to  our  own  days, 
and  that  there  was  no  time,  and  there  will  be  no  time, 
in  which  the  Church  was  not  and  shall  not  be.  This 
we  may  ascertain  from  the  words  of  the  Saviour  him- 
self to  his  Disciples,  ^'Lo,  I  am  with  you  always  even 
unto  the  end  of  the  world."  '' 

She  is  also  Catholic  in  consideration  of  her  teaching 
all  the  Orthodox  doctrines,  in  a  satisfactory  and  thor- 
ough way.  Thus  St.  Cyril  of  Jerusalem,  in  his  sermon 
quoted  above,  says,  'The  Church  is  called  Catholic 
because  she  teaches  all  the  doctrines  which  mankind 
needs  to  know,  about  things  visible  and  invisible,  about 
things  heavenly  and  earthly,  and,  in  general,  without 
omitting  anything." 

Again  she  is  called  Catholic  in  consideration  of  her 
purpose,  which  is  to  attract  to  her  all  nations  and  sub- 
ject to  her,  for  true  worship,  all  mankind,  of  whatever 
race  or  station,  to  heal  all  sorts  of  sins,  and  to  teach  all 
virtues  which  consist  of  deeds  and  words.    And  this, 

1  Rev.   5:9.     ^  Rev.  7:9.     •'^  Didactic  Sermons,   18.     4  Vol.  II,  p.   202. 
•"  St.  Mt.  28:20;  1  Cor.   11:26. 


1034  Appendices 

too,  St.  Cyril  refers  to  in  his  sermon  (Cap.  23)  where 
he  says,  ''The  Church  is  called  Catholic  because  of  her 
subjugation  to  true  religion  of  all  mankind,  the  lead- 
ers and  the  led,  the  learned  and  the  illiterate;  and  be- 
cause she  treats  and  cures  every  sort  of  sin,  committed 
by  the  soul  or  body,  and  contains  within  herself  every 
conceivable  thought  of  virtue,  in  word  and  deed,  and 
all  the  various  spiritual  gifts." 

In  this  and  the  preceding  quotation,  this  venerable 
Father  among  saints,  and  divinely-minded  teacher  of 
theology  comprehended  all  the  attributes  of  Catholicity 
in  the  Church — her  extension  in  the  inhabited  world,  in 
the  north,  south,  east,  and  west;  and  her  inclusion  of 
every  race,  tongue,  and  kindred,  as  the  Apostle  says, 
"There  is  neither  Greek  nor  Jew,  circumcision  nor  un- 
circumcision.  Barbarian,  Scythian,  bond  nor  free:  but 
Christ  is  all,  and  in  all.^ 

Secondly,  comprising  all  the  true  teachings  of  salva- 
tion and  Orthodox  doctrines.  And  this  descripton  is 
the  original  and  essential  one  by  which  the  Church  is 
called  Catholic;  for  it  is  an  attribute  belonging  intrin- 
sically to  her,  potentially  and  actually,  impossible  of 
separation  from  her;  for  there  has  been  no  time  when 
the  Church  has  not  held  the  true  teaching  or  maintained 
it. 

However,  the  description  of  the  Church  as  extend- 
ing through  the  whole  inhabited  world,  and  her  sub- 
jection of  all  mankind,  is  a  potative  one;  for  it  is  not 
otherwise  rightful  for  any  of  the  Christian  churches 
to  claim  catholicity,  since  to  the  present  day  there  is  no 
church  nor  any  that  has  subjected  the  whole  human 
race,  leaders  and  led,  learned  and  illiterate.  Said  the 
beatified  of  everlasting  memory,  St.  Macarius,  Bishop 
of  Moscow,  in  his  book  on  Orthodox  Theology,  "It  is 
not  necessary  for  the  Church  to  embrace  actually  all 
the  inhabited  world  and  all  mankind  to  be  called  Cath- 
olic; for  it  was  not  possible  for  the  Church  to  spread 

iCol.   3:11;   1  Cor.  12:13. 


Appendices  1035 

except  gradually,  as  she  is  still  spreading  and  as  she  has 
for  eighteen  centuries.  The  Church  may  even  be  de- 
limited by  heresies  and  innovations,  or  by  the  persecu- 
tions of  her  enemies,  yet  be  said  to  have  been  and  still 
to  be  Catholic  in  her  purpose.  .  .  .  And  from  this  it 
becomes  evident  why  the  holy  Fathers  called  the 
Church  in  the  age  of  the  Apostles,  and  generally  in  the 
first  three  centuries.  Catholic,  when  she  was  incompar- 
ably smaller  than  she  is  now,  indicating  thereby  her 
tendency  or  inclination  to  catholicity." 

Is  the  application  of  the  attribute  of  Catholicity  to 
the  Church  of  Christ,  however,  sufficient  to  indicate  the 
meaning  of  truth  ?  I  say.  No.  For  all  the  churches  that 
call  on  the  Name  of  Christ  throughout  the  world  claim 
thereby  to  be  Catholic;  for  they  all  differ  from  the  Jew- 
ish Church,  being  unrestricted  in  themselves,  in  any 
particular  place,  time,  or  nation.  How  then  shall  we 
distinguish  the  truth  of  this  claim?  We  reply,  to  know 
one  truly  Catholic  Church  we  simply  go  to  the  original 
and  true  definition  of  catholicity  by  which  the  holy 
Canons  and  the  Confession  of  Faith  called  the  Church 
Catholic,  or  universal.  According  to  this,  the  Church 
is  called  Catholic  because  her  teachings  and  command- 
ments are  complete  and  all-inclusive,  comprising  all 
that  is  necessary  for  salvation,  laid  down  and  approved 
by  the  holy  Apostles  and  the  noble  Ecumenical  Coun- 
cils, and  kept  in  one  form  by  all  her  Christian  sons  in 
all  parts  of  the  inhabited  world,  not  merely  by  some  of 
her  individual  members  or  organizations. 

The  true  Catholic  Church,  therefore,  is  the  firm 
canonical  and  legal  Church,  comprising  the  Apostolic 
teaching,  sound  in  all  its  parts  and  at  all  times,  without 
fault  or  discord  in  the  sacred  doctrines,  Christian  cus- 
toms, and  church  organization  just  as  she  received  these 
from  the  holy  Apostles  and  the  holy  Ecumenical  Coun- 
cils. And  therefore,  as  the  Church  is  distinguished  by 
the  first  attribute,  non-restriction,  from  the  restricted 
Jewish  Church,  so  by  the  second,  that  is  by  her  inclu- 


1036  Appendices 

sivencss  and  preservation  of  the  universal  teaching  of 
doctrine,  church  doctrines,  and  unimpaired  Apostlic 
traditions,  she  is  distinguished  from  heretics,  innova- 
tors, and  schismatics,  who  have  deviated  from  sound 
teaching.  She  is  therefore  not  spurious,  claiming  unity 
when  in  truth  she  is  separated  into  many  divisions,  and 
differs  in  her  organization,  her  customs,  and  her  doc- 
trines withal. 

If  one  of  these  divisions  usurps  to  itself  the  title  of 
Catholicity,  claiming  this  as  its  truthful  title  either  be- 
cause of  the  large  number  of  its  followers  or  because  it  is 
spread  in  numerous  places,  the  true  Church  does  not 
vouchsafe  it  this  right,  believing  such  a  division  to  be 
faulty  in  Orthodoxy,  and  because  the  Catholicity  of  the 
Church  consists  briefly  in  Orthodoxy.  For  this  cause 
the  holy  Fathers  did  not  stop  at  describing  the  Church 
as  One,  Catholic,  and  Holy,  but  added  Apostolic. 
Hence  every  church  that  is  not  Apostolic,  Orthodox,  is 
not  Catholic. 

It  is  therefore  proper  to  conclude  this  discussion  with 
the  words  of  St.  Athanasius  the  Great,  in  his  Epistle 
against  those  who  consider  truth  in  a  matter  only  in 
proportion  to  the  great  number  who  follow  it,  ''The 
multitude  who  claim  the  truth  without  sound  reasons 
are  more  able  to  intimidate  than  to  convince." 

Holiness 

The  third  distinguishing  mark  of  the  Church  of 
Christ  is  Holiness,  of  which  St.  Paul  says,  ''As  Christ 
also  loved  the  Church  and  gave  himself  for  it;  that  he 
might  sanctify  and  cleanse  it  with  the  washing  of  the 
water  by  the  word,  that  he  might  present  it  to  himself 
a  glorious  church  not  having  spot,  or  wrinkle,  or  any 
such  thing;  but  that  it  should  be  holy  and  without 
blemish."  ' 


lEph.  5:25-27. 


Appendices  10.^7 

She  is  Holy,  first  because  of  her  origin;  for  God  him- 
self, the  Fountain  of  holiness,  is  her  Foundation  and 
Help.  Secondly,  in  view  of  her  means,  her  teachings 
and  her  holy  Sacraments,  through  which  she  is  pre- 
served and  perfected  for  the  sanctification  of  her  faith- 
ful. Thirdly,  in  view  of  her  purpose  or  aim;  for  her 
members  are  called  unto  holiness  and  required  to  press 
forward  to  it.  Should  one  ask,  ''How  can  the  Church 
be  holy  when  there  are  many  members  in  her  who  are 
unholy,  yea,  sinners  and  defiled  by  all  kinds  of  evils  and 
vices?"  We  reply,  as  we  previously  said,  that  the 
Church  is  considered  holy  in  view  of  her  origin,  means, 
and  purpose.  The  purpose  or  aim  of  the  Church,  there- 
fore, is  to  sanctify,  purify,  and  save  all  members  that 
belong  to  her.  It  does  not  mar  this  holy  purpose,  nor 
defile  the  Holiness  of  the  Church,  if  some  of  her  mem- 
bers wallow  in  the  pollutions  of  this  age,  robed  in  adul- 
tery, and  putting  off  the  robes  of  divine  grace  and  holi- 
ness. Howbeit,  the  Church  never  despairs  of  healing 
these,  her  ill  members,  nor  has  she  ceased  to  care  for 
them,  steadying  their  steps  towards  repentance  by  coun- 
sels, reproofs,  and  canon  which  she  imposes  on  them  to 
bring  them  unto  the  sanctification  of  soul  and  body. 

This  we  learn  from  the  acts  of  the  Apostles  and  the 
ancient  Church.  Thus  the  Apostles  used  to  establish 
and  strengthen  all  the  faithful  for  the  preservation  of 
goodly  virtues  and  pure  conduct.  They  did  not  con- 
sider the  wicked  and  those  of  ill  repute  as  altogether 
outside  the  Church.  On  the  contrary,  they  employed 
various  means  and  methods  for  reforming  them,  this 
being:  one  of  their  main  cares,  as  the  Apostle  John  said 
in  his  first  general  Epistle.  "My  little  children,  these 
things  write  I  unto  you,  that  ye  sin  not.  And  if  any  man 
sin,  we  have  an  advocate  with  the  Father,  Jesus  Christ 
the  righteous."  ^  And  also  in  the  same  Epistle,  ''Tf  we  say 
that  we  have  no  sin,  we  deceive  ourselves,  and  the  truth 
is  not  in  us."  ^    And  in  the  Gospels  the  Church  is  lik- 


1  1   St.  Jn.  2:1.       2  ]    St.   Jn.    1:1 


1038  ,  Appendices 

ened  to  a  field  in  which  the  wheat  and  tares  grow  to- 
gether, and  to  a  net  that  is  cast  into  the  sea  and  is  filled 
with  all  kinds  of  fish.  It  is  not  strange,  therefore,  to  find 
in  the  Church  the  sheep  and  the  goats,  the  wicked  serv- 
ant and  good  servant,  the  wise  virgins  and  the  foolish 
virgins.  It  is  for  God  to  discriminate  between  them. 
And  lastly,  we  say  the  Church  here  on  earth  resembles 
the  threshing-floor  on  which  wheat  is  mixed  with  the 
chafi,  and  the  just  God  will  purge  his  floor  and  gather 
the  wheat  into  his  garners  on  the  last  day,  but  the  chaff 
He  will  burn  with  unquenchable  fire.^  And  for  what 
reason  did  the  Son  of  God  bow  the  heavens  and  come 
down  to  earth?  Was  it  not  to  save  sinners?  For  if  the 
Church  embraced  only  the  holy,  why  was  it  founded? 
For  whom  is  sanctification,  and  for  whom  was  insti- 
tuted the  Sacrament  of  Penance,  and  the  other  Sacra- 
ments? For  whom  came  salvation?  The  true  Church, 
therefore,  is  one  as  Christ  said  which  calls  sinners  not 
the  righteous  to  repentance.  As  for  the  sinners  who 
repent  not,  sometimes  by  the  divine  authority  granted 
the  pastors  of  the  Church,  and  sometimes  by  an  invis- 
ible act  of  God,  they  are  cut  ofT  from  the  body  of  the 
Church  as  dead  members,  and  in  this  way  the  Church 
continues  to  be  holy. 

Apostolicity 

The  fourth  distinguishing  sign  of  the  Orthodox 
Church  is  Apostolicity,  meaning  that  it  is  built  on  the 
foundation  of  the  Apostles,  as  the  Apostle  Paul  said  in 
his  Epistle  to  the  people  of  Ephesus,  ''And  are  built 
upon  the  foundation  of  the  apostles  and  prophets,  Jesus 
Christ  himself  being  the  chief  corner  stone."  - 

This  Apostolicity  consists,  first,  of  the  teaching  of 
the  faith,  provided  such  teaching  is  kept  as  preached 
and  taught  by  the  holy  Apostles,  without  defect  in  state- 
ment or  measure;  secondly,  in  the  canonical  ordination 


iSt.  Mt.   3:12.      2Eph.  2:20. 


Appendices  1039 

of  pastors  for  the  Church,  as  successors  of  the  Apostles, 
and  the  continuity  of  the  chain  of  their  succession  after 
them. 

These  four  marks  are  possessed  only  by  the  Orthodox 
Church.  For  this  reason  she  is  the  only  ark  patterned 
by  God  which  saves,  which  brings  the  faithful  to  eter- 
nal bliss,  and  without  her  there  is  no  salvation.  She  is 
ONE  because  all  the  multitudes  of  the  faithful  Ortho- 
dox, of  whatever  tribe,  and  in  whatever  place  found, 
confess  by  one  Orthodox  confession  the  noble  doctrines 
of  faith,  and  worship  one  God  in  true  worship,  being 
one  body  only. 

She  is  HOLY  because  from  the  time  she  was  insti- 
tuted she  grew  in  a  holy  way,  preserving  and  complet- 
ing the  holy  Sacraments  to  sanctify  the  faithful. 

She  is  CATHOLIC  because  she  embraces  all  the 
faithful  in  all  parts  of  the  inhabited  world  from  the 
time  she  was  founded  to  the  end  of  time,  teaching  the 
doctrines  of  salvation  in  a  general  way,  without  excep- 
tion, and  managing  the  afiPairs  of  her  own  members  as 
much  as  possible. 

She  is  APOSTOLIC  because  she  has  preserved  the 
doctrines  of  faith  safe  and  sound  to  the  utmost,  without 
defect,  as  she  received  them  from  the  holy  Apostles, 
changing  nothing  and  inventing  nothing,  however 
slight. 

In  conclusion,  in  true  Catholicity  it  is  not  expansion 
in  space,  or  greatness  of  number  only,  that  are  looked 
for,  but  the  Catholicity  of  space  must  be  identical  with 
Catholicity  of  doctrine,  the  divine  teaching  in  gen- 
eral, being  perfect  and  complete,  recalling  here  what 
the  great  St.  Athanasius  said,  'The  multitude  who 
claim  the  truth  without  sound  reason  are  more  able  to 
intimidate  than  to  convince." 

The  True  Church 

This  Apostolic,  Orthodox,  and  Catholic  Church,  is 
the  Orthodox  Church  in  truth,  the  Eastern  Church  in 


1040  Appendices 

name,  which  embraces  all  true  Christians,  in  the  north 
and  the  south,  in  the  east  and  the  west,  and  which  gath- 
ers into  her  bosom  many  nations  from  all  parts  of  the 
world.  She  is  in  truth  Apostolic  because  she  took  her 
beginning  from  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  his  unde- 
filed  Apostles,  as  we  said  before,  who  founded  her  and 
established  her  not  only  in  her  entirety,  but  in  her  parts 
also,  as  in  Jerusalem,  Antioch,  Alexandria,  Constanti- 
nople, and  other  places.  These  apostolic  sees  (cathe- 
dras)  have  remained  firm,  and  the  chain  of  their  pastors 
is  in  successive  continuity,  having  been  founded  by  the 
Lord  and  his  Apostles.  She  is  organized  in  accordance 
with  the  wish  of  her  founder,  Jesus  Christ,  and  his  holy 
Apostles.  She  knows  one  Head,  not  a  mortal  man, 
temporal  by  nature,  subject  at  every  moment  to  error 
and  mistake,  and  residing  in  this  city  or  that  metropolis. 
Rather,  she  recognizes  the  One  and  true  Head,  the  in- 
visible and  incarnate  God,  Saviour  of  the  world,  Jesus 
Christ,  who  is  alone  infallible.  She  has  also  true  pas- 
tors, coming  in  an  unbroken  succession  from  the  Apos- 
tles. Her  Ministry  is  divided  into  three  Orders  or 
degrees.  Every  local  church  has  its  own  Bishop,  and 
all  her  Bishops  recognize  and  submit  equally  to  the  ulti- 
mate authority  of  the  Ecumenical  Councils.  The  teach- 
ing of  faith,  and  true  worship  is  uninterrupted  in  her, 
and  the  rites  of  her  services  and  Sacraments  are  com- 
plete and  perfect,  being  founded  on  original  canons,  set 
forth  from  ancient  times,  and  confirmed  by  those  who 
have  the  right  to  confirm.  She  is  in  truth  a  Church 
because  all  the  attributes  of  a  Church  belong  to  her, 
such  as  Holiness,  Unity,  Catholicity,  etc.  Her  teach- 
ing is  holy  because  it  corresponds  to  God's  words  and 
pure  transmission  of  the  Fathers,  ancient,  Orthodox, 
free  of  all  falsification  and  alteration,  of  any  addition  or 
omission.  Nor  does  she  hold  anything  that  is  contrary 
thereto,  of  heresy  or  innovation  of  the  human  mind. 
She  is  sufficient  to  the  nourishment  of  the  faithful,  and 
to  cause  to  grow  in  them  all  that  is  necessary  for  salva- 
tion, and  required  for  godliness.     Her  Sacraments  and 


Appendices  I  Of  I 

fulfillments  are  also  holy,  because  in  spirit  and  in  fact 
they  are  in  the  most  appropriate  form,  worthy  to  grant 
the  faithful  sanctification  by  grace,  to  cause  to  grow  in 
them  the  feeling  of  piety,  elevating  their  minds  and 
souls  to  the  heavens,  in  accordance  with  her  purpose. 
She  is  too  pure  to  mingle  with  anything  that  is  false, 
dense,  worldly,  or  unseemly.  She  is  holy  in  her  pastor- 
ate; for  this  pastorate  is  spiritual,  based  on  apostolic  and 
paternal  canons  and  commandments,  and  also  removed 
from  worldly  things  and  all  that  has  a  tendency  to  be 
immersed  in  temporal  authority.  She  is  holy  in  her 
children,  because  she  has  brought  a  countless  multitude 
into  possession  of  the  triumphant  Church  in  all  periods 
of  time.  These  are  the  cloud  of  witnesses  of  countless 
number,  the  ranks  of  High  Priests,  the  mass  of  godly 
people  and  confessors,  and  the  rest  of  the  righteous  in 
whom  the  great  wonders  of  God  have  appeared,  and 
who  in  every  age  are  soldiers  of  the  Lord  of  hosts,  who 
receive  the  crown  of  victory  after  triumph.  She  is  also 
One  since  she  does  not  side  with  the  spirit  of  every 
teaching;  for,  while  embracing  many  tongues  and 
many  nations,  her  faith  is  one,  her  Sacraments,  serv- 
ices, doctrines,  and  canons  are  one,  her  Ministry  is  one, 
and  her  Head  is  one,  Jesus  Christ,  and  her  pastors  are 
united  in  the  one  bond  of  love,  keeping  ^'The  unity  of 
the  Spirit  in  the  bond  of  peace."  ^  This  quality  makes 
her  remote  from  any  stigma  of  hatred,  and  to  be  cease- 
less in  prayer  and  supplication  for  the  unity  of  all 
churches.  And  while  she  works  to  her  utmost  for  this 
unity,  she  does  not  approve  at  all  of  the  use  of  force 
and  persecution,  or  of  deceitful  societies  for  its  attain- 
ment. On  the  contrary,  she  calls  men  to  it  by  counsel 
and  teaching,  meekness  and  the  proof  of  the  Spirit. 
Above  all  this,  she  embraces  in  her  bosom  many  nations, 
as  we  said  before,  guarding  the  definitions  of  the  Apos- 
tolic, Ecumenical  Councils  and  the  truth  and  perfec- 
tion of  the  noble  and  holy  Confession  of  Faith.

On  the  I  nf  all  ability  of  the  Christian  Church  and  Her 
Ecumenical  Councils 

This  Catholic,  Holy,  and  Apostolic  Church,  being 
the  body  of  Christ  and  one  in  relation  to  her  one  Head,^ 
and  consisting  of  the  totality  of  believers  in  the  Son  of 
God,  Jesus  Christ,  both  leaders  and  led,  pastors  and 
congregation,  teachers  and  disciples,  is  built  by  Christ 
God  Himself,  who  stands  in  her  midst  to  the  end  of 
time,  and  who  is  always  found  in  her  among  those  who 
come  together  in  his  Name.^     She  is  led  by  the  Holy 
Spirit  who  ever  guides  her  into  all  the  truth,  and  abides 
with  her  for  ever,  according  to  his  truthful  promise, 
''And  I  will  pray  the  Father,  and  he  shall  give  you  an- 
other Comforter,  that  he  may  abide  with  you  for  ever. 
.  .  .  He  shall  teach  you  all  things,  and  bring  all  things 
to  your  remembrance,  whatsoever  I  have  said  unto  you 
.  .  .  and  he  will  guide  you  into  all  truth." ^    She  is  also 
confirmed  by  God  the  Father  by  his  sanctification  of 
her  through  his  truth.^     She  being  ''The  pillar  and 
ground  of  the  truth,"  '"'  established  firmly  for  ever  on  her 
foundation  Christ,  and  the  truth  of  faith  in  him,  pre- 
serving his  Gospel  and  teachings  and  preaching  them 
in  all  the  inhabited  world,  according  to  his  divine  com- 
mand, "Go  ye  into  all  the  world  and  preach  the  Gospel 
to  every  creature  .  .  .  teaching  them  to  observe  all  things 
whatsoever  I  have  commanded  you :  and  lo,  I  am  with 
you   always  even  unto  the  end   of   the  world",^  they 
having  rightly  divided  the  word  of  truth, "^  it  follows 
that  she  is  infallible  from  all  error  and  falsehood,  espe- 
cially in  her  Ecumenical  Councils;  for  it  is  necessary 
that  the  attribute  of  truth,  hence  infallibility,  hence,  sal- 
vation, go  always  with  her  religious  and  moral  teach- 
ings, this  being  connected  with  man's  true  worship,  his 
salvation,  and  hence  his  union  with  God.

Appendices  1043 

If  it  is  possible  to  admit  error,  falsehood,  and  lies  as 
pertaining  to  the  Holy  Church  of  Christ,  in  her  deter- 
mination of  doctrines,  religious  teachings,  rules,  and 
canons,  it  is  possible  to  admit  this  even  in  the  case  of  the 
Holy  Scriptures  which  contain  the  truths  inspired  by 
God  for  the  guidance  of  mankind. 

This  can  never  be.  The  Prophets  who  wrote  the 
Holy  Scriptures,  spoke  of  God  as  their  title  implies; 
for  the  word  Prophet  signifies  speaking  for  God  (from 
the  Greek  pro  and  phanae),  since  the  Prophets  spoke 
of  God,  his  purposes,  and  his  will. 

If  this  be  the  case,  how  is  it  possible  to  admit  error 
and  falsehood  in  the  Prophets  of  God  and  his  Apostles, 
when  we  are  commanded  by  God  himself  to  follow 
them,  obey  them,  and  believe  what  they  told  us  of  him 
(may  he  be  glorified).  Would  we  not  be,  in  that  case, 
as  those  following,  obeying,  and  believing  erroneous, 
false,  and  lying  men? 

Or,  how  could  God  who  commanded  us  to  beware 
lying,  falsehood,  and  error  consent  to  our  following 
persons  who  are  subject  to  these  things?  How  could 
God  the  Undefiled  use  such  vessels  for  his  Holy  Spirit? 
Further,  what  will  be  their  position  who  hold  God 
above  all  blame  and  deficiency,  yet  ascribe  to  his  serv- 
ants, who  are  the  image  of  his  perfection,  what  is 
beneath  his  dignity?  For  this  reason  we  have  said  that 
we  cannot  consider  the  Church  except  as  above  error, 
infallible  in  her  faith,  her  sayings,  her  teachings,  her 
decrees,  and  her  rules,  free  of  lying,  deceit,  intellectual 
hypocrisy,  error,  falsehood,  and  baseness  in  her  canons. 

The  teaching  of  the  Holy  Bible  on  the  infallibility 
of  the  Church  in  her  Ecumenical  Councils  was  known 
to  all  the  venerable  Fathers  of  the  Church  and  to  her 
honourable  teachers  from  ancient  times  to  the  present 
day.  It  was  recognized  by  the  Ecumenical  Councils 
themselves  as  the  Seventh  Ecumencial  Council  in  its 
first  canon  regarding  the  previous  six  councils,  where  it 
says,  and  its  saying  is  true  and  free  of  every  defect.

^'The  divine  canons  are  an  example  unto  the  clergy  that 
may  follow  in  their  way,  and  thus  we  accept  them  all 
gladly,  singing  with  David,  the  revealer  of  divinities, 
to  the  Lord  and  saying,  'I  have  rejoiced  in  the  way  of 
thy  testimonies,  as  much  as  in  all  riches."  ^  And  also, 
^'The  righteousness  of  thy  testimonies  is  everlasting: 
give  me  understanding,  and  I  shall  live."-  If  therefore, 
these  prophetic  words  thus  reveal  to  us  that  we  should 
keep  God's  testimonies  and  live  by  them  for  ever,  it  is 
evident  that  they  remain  firm  and  unshaken,  and  Moses 
the  beholder  of  God,  also  says  that  we  cannot  add  unto 
them  nor  diminish  aught  from  them.'  And  the  Apos- 
tle Peter,  filled  with  pride  in  them,  cries  out,  "Which 
things  the  angels  desire  to  look  into."^  And  again  St. 
Paul  says,  "But  though  we,  or  an  angel  from  heaven, 
preach  any  other  gospel  unto  you  than  that  which  we 
have  preached  unto  you,  let  him  be  accursed."  •"'  These 
things,  therefore,  being  known  unto  us  in  this  manner, 
let  us  concern  ourselves  with  them,  as  one  finding  many 
treasures.  Let  us  serenely  receive  these  divine  canons 
and  keep  their  contents  with  unshaken  confidence,  in 
accordance  with  what  was  set  forth  by  those  trumpets 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  all-praised  Apostles,  and  was 
decreed  by  the  six  holy  P^cumenical  and  local  Councils, 
which  were  held  for  delivering  such  commandments, 
and  in  accordance  with  what  was  determined  by  our 
holy  Fathers,  who  were  all  illuminated  by  the  very  same 
Spirit,  laying  down  what  is  fitting. 

And  likewise  the  Patriarchs  of  the  East,  in  their 
Epistle  to  the  Holy  Russian  Synod,  "We  admit  and 
confess,  without  the  least  doubt,  this  firm  truth,  namely 
that  the  universal  (Catholic)  Church  cannot  err  and 
deviate  from  the  truth;  or  be  deceived  and  thus  re- 
veal lies  instead  of  truth;  for  the  all-holy  Spirit  who

WHAT  PRAYER  IS  AND  ITS  ACKNOWLEDG- 
MENT 

This  Church  of  the  Son  of  God,  sanctified  by  his 
Father's  truth  and  administered  by  his  Holy  Spirit, 
acting  in  accordance  with  what  he  revealed  in  his  pre- 
cious Book,  was  led  to  him  and  guided  by  his  command- 
ments by  conviction  of  the  conscience  that  what  he 
revealed  to  his  servants  is  God's  religion,  his  true  law, 
and  the  way  of  salvation  leading  to  him,  decreed  the 
necessity  of  prayer,  which  is  only  the  rising  of  the  soul 
to  God,  union  with  him  mentally,  and  communicating 
with  him  spiritually. 

This  prayer  is  always  either  a  supplication,  by  which 
one  seeks  to  draw  near  to  God;  a  petition  for  forgive- 
ness; thanks  for  his  grace;  a  deliverance  from  some 
adversity;  a  performance  of  the  religious  duty  of  wor- 
ship; or  glorification  for  miracles;  as  in  the  words  of 
the  Son  of  Sirach  the  Wise,  ''And  he  hath  given  men 
skill,  that  he  might  be  honoured  in  his  marvelous 
works."  ^ 

The  Effect  of  Prayer  and  Its  Purpose 

And  as  there  is  no  spiritual  life  without  prayer,  God 
made  it  compulsory  for  man,  linking  it  with  appointed 
and  successive  times,  that  its  succession  may  make  for 
the  permanency  of  obedience  and  supplication  to  him, 
as  in  his  saying,  ''Watch  and  pray."'^  And  like  what  the 
Apostle  said,  "Pray  without  ceasing."  ^  Thus  with  the 
continuity  of  our  prayers  and  supplications  our  obedi- 
ence will  continue,  and  with  continuity  of  our  obedi- 
ence, our  awe  of  him  and  our  desire  for  him  will  con- 
tinue ;  and  with  the  continuity  of  our  awe  and  desre  will 
continue  the  goodness  of  God's  creatures  and  the  purity 
of  conduct  leading  unto  him.

By  prayer,  therefore,  we  discharge  our  debt  to  the 
Creator,^  receiving  in  exchange  absolution  of  our  sins,^ 
deliverance  from  distresses  and  calamities,^  with  the 
healing  of  our  bodies  and  the  salvation  of  our  souls,  as 
in  the  Holy  Bible,  ''My  son,  in  thy  sickness  be  not  neg- 
ligent: but  pray  unto  the  Lord,  and  he  will  make  thee 
whole."^  And  also,  ''Is  any  among  you  afflicted?  Let 
him  pray.  .  .  .  And  the  prayer  of  faith  shall  save  the 
sick,  and  the  Lord  shall  raise  him  up:  And  if  he  have 
committed  sins,  they  shall  be  forgiven  him.""' 

If  we  are  not  healed  at  once  of  our  ills,  we  shall  be 
granted  by  God's  favour  the  power  and  help  to  bear 
our  ills  patiently,  however  long  they  endure.  And  if 
the  sickness  is  incurable,  then  through  God's  mercies, 
we  obtain  suitable  time  for  repentance  and  for  sufficient 
preparation  to  face  death  with  an  easy  conscience.  In 
this  there  is  enough  consolation  for  our  souls  at  the 
end  of  our  lives,  after  which  we  may  stand  with  great 
favour  before  our  righteous  Judge,  having  fulfilled 
what  he  commanded  us  to  do,  enjoying  thereafter  that 
to  which  the  intent  of  prayer  and  the  effectiveness  of 
worship  lead,  which  is  union  with  God  who  is  exalted 
and  praised,  as  it  is  said,  "Whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  in 
prayer,  believing,  ye  shall  receive."^'  As  it  was  with 
that  thief  on  the  cross,  who  uttered  that  passionate  pray- 
er in  the  last  moment  of  his  life,  saying,  "Lord,  remem- 
ber me  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom,"  the  Sav- 
iour answering  him  and  saying,  "Today  shalt  thou  be 
with  me  in  paradise."^ 


THE  FOUNDING  OF  THE  CHURCH  AND  BY 
WHOM  IT  WAS  FOUNDED

God,  his  only  Son,  which  he  founded  at  the  time  of  his 

iPs.    42:8.      2  Numbers    21:7.      3  Acts    10:2,    4.      4  Sirach    38:9.      •"•  St.

Incarnation  for  the  salvation  of  mankind;  for  God,  in 
his  abundant  mercy  and  surpassing  love,  not  w^ishing 
that  the  work  of  salvation  cease  with  his  Ascension  into 
heaven,  instituted  a  rank  of  persons  to  work  with  him, 
after  his  departing  bodily  from  this  world.  This  is  af- 
affirmed  by  the  God-mantled  Ignatius  in  his  Epistle  to 
gether  with  God,  ye  are  God's  husbandry,  ye  are  God's 
building."  ^  In  this  way,  then,  was  salvation  to  pervade 
all  peoples  at  all  times,  as  he  himself  said,  "Go  ye  there- 
fore, and  teach  all  nations  .  .  .  teaching  them  to  observe 
all  things  whatsoever  I  have  commanded  you.  And 
lo,  I  am  with  you  always  even  unto  the  end  of  the 
world."  ^  And  again,  "Then  Jesus  said  to  them  again. 
Peace  be  unto  you,  as  my  Father  hath  sent  me,  even  so, 
send  I  you."^ 

Ritual  Books 

In  accordance  with  this  command,  therefore,  and 
with  this  divine  economy,  the  undefiled  Apostles  and 
their  followers  after  them  walked,  teaching  men  the 
way  of  salvation  and  true  belief.  In  addition  also  to 
the  moral  teachings  and  the  beliefs  which  pertain  to 
salvation,  and  in  compliance  with  God's  revelation  in 
his  previous  book,  the  Old  and  the  New  Testaments, 
they  introduced  special  prayers  applying  to  every  oc- 
casion or  sickness.  In  this  way  were  the  church  ordi- 
nances also  formed  and  recorded  in  ritual  books  as  they 
were  called.  These  ritual  books  consist  of  services,  such 
as  the  divine  service  of  the  Mass  by  the  Apostle  James, 
and  that  of  Saints  Basil,  John,  and  Gregory,  the  bap- 
tisimal  service  and  the  services  for  the  rest  of  the  Sac- 
raments; of  offices,  such  as  the  Midnight  Office,  Matins, 
the  Canonical  Hours,  the  Makarizmoi,  Vespers,  the 
Slumber  Prayer  (Compline),  the  Paracletice,  and 
others;  of  useful  eulogies  and  hymns  of  praise,  such  as 
the  praise  of  the  Theotokos,  and  the  eulogies  of  the 
saints  in  the  Horologium,  the  Menaion,  and  others;  of 

1  1   Cor.   1:9.      2  St.  Mt.  28:19,   20.      3  St.  Jn.  20:21.

the  accounts  and  acts  of  the  saints;  of  divine  teachings 
from  the  Gospel,  the  Epistles,  the  Old  Testament,  such 
as  the  Prophets,  etc;  of  hymns  of  praise  unto  God  for  his 
benevolences;  of  petitions  and  supplications  to  God  for 
his  power  and  benignancy  in  times  of  distress  and  hard- 
ship, and  of  other  similar  topics,  sometimes  intertvs^ined 
with  religious  doctrines,  sometimes  consisting  of  relig- 
ious doctrines  alone,  and  sometimes  separate. 

The  Nature  of  Hymns,  Eulogies,  Ritual,  and  Service 

in  Prayer 

For  further  elucidation,  it  may  be  said  here  that 
church  hymns  and  eulogies  are  not  of  the  nature  of 
doctrinal  or  canonical  definitions.  They  are  rather  the 
outpourings  of  righteous  or  pietistic  feelings  which 
move  the  listeners  to  piety  and  righteousness,  and  to 
the  imitation  of  God's  chosen  ones.  They  arouse  in 
those  who  hear  them  the  same  spirit  of  piety  that  was 
in  the  eulogized  saints,  bringing  out  great  admiration 
and  reverence  for  virtue,  that  thereby  we  may  come  to 
love  it  and  hold  fast  to  it,  following  the  example  of 
those  who  thereby  pleased  God,  for  which  he  had 
chosen  them,  yea  even  adopted  them  as  his  sons. 

If,  therefore,  we  find  that  the  eulogist,  in  praising  one 
of  the  Apostles,  Fathers,  teachers,  or  saints,  of  whatever 
rank,  has  gone  too  far,  his  act  should  not  be  regarded  as 
wrong,  but  merely  as  excessive  reverence,  in  which  the 
aim  is  the  benefit  of  the  listeners.  Equally,  the  eulogy 
should  not  be  taken  as  a  recording  of  history,  the  pro- 
mulgation of  a  rule,  the  statement  of  a  doctrine,  or  the 
designation  of  office  or  rank.  Rather,  the  eulogizer's 
aim  and  purpose  is  the  exaltation  of  the  eulogized,  the 
depicting  of  his  attributes,  and  the  glorification  of  his 
virtues.  And  this  latter  the  eulogist  does  for  two  rea- 
sons— first,  to  express  his  feelings  towards  the  eulogized, 
and  secondly,  for  the  instruction  of  the  listeners  in  the 
virtues  and  attributes  of  the  eulogized,  thus  making 
them  objects  of  emulation  by  those  listeners.    And  what

is  said  of  cluirch  eulogies  may  be  said  also  of  the  ser- 
mons, discourses,  and  teachings. 

Rites,  or  rituals,  on  the  other  hand,  are  the  orders 
and  classification  of  religious  celebrations,  while  the 
service  is  the  actual  performance  of  religious  worship, 
in  accordance  with  a  set  order  and  embodied  especially 
in  a  book  for  the  arrangement  of  the  services  and  known 
as  the

which  signifies  order  or  arrangement.  The  Typicon 
gives  the  order  of  church  rites  for  all  the  services,  spe- 
cial prayers,  and  church  celebrations  for  the  whole  year. 

The  Object  of  Ceremonies  and  Rites  Displayed  in 

Prayer 

We  have  already  seen  the  object  which  the  Church 
had  in  instituting  its  doctrines  and  moral  teachings,  the 
prayers,  the  order  of  celebrations,  rites  and  festivities, 
the  eulogies,  which  most  likely  appeared  in  the  eighth, 
ninth,  and  tenth  centuries,  and  after  that  time,  and  the 
service  of  the  Divine  Mass.  All  these  the  Church  or- 
dained well  and  with  respect  to  the  dignity  of  their 
respective  subjects,  lest  there  be  any  confusion  in  the 
subjects  of  worship  and  in  its  holy  rites.  But 
there  is  another  object.  It  is  to  give  us  sensible  proofs, 
pointing  to  the  true  Orthodox  doctrines  which  are  in- 
visible, as  the  revealer  of  the  divine  Sacraments  said, 
''God  reveals  to  us  spiritual  things  under  the  guise  of 
corporeal  things."  And  thus  God  leads  us  through 
these  to  his  divine  perfection,  and  finally,  to  eternal 
unity  with  him. 

On  the  Sublimity  of  Religion  and  how  People  Differ 
in  its  Reception 

The  Christian  religion  received  its  perfection  from 
its  beginning,  because  it  is  not  a  human  invention,  but 


1050  Appendices 

an  act  of  God,  which  he  wrought  without  ambiguity 
for  the  salvation  of  mankind.  Whence  we  say  that  no 
succession  of  time,  even  unto  the  end  of  ages  can  bring 
forth  anything  for  the  cultivation  of  character  and  the 
regulation  of  the  life  of  mankind,  that  can  be  better, 
more  sublime,  or  more  beneficial  than  what  Christ  God 
taught  his  Apostles,  and  the  Apostles  taught  those  who 
succeeded  them. 

However,  this  teaching,  so  sublime,  showed  different 
efifects,  according  to  the  differences  in  the  condition  of 
those  who  received  it,  and  according  to  the  measure  of 
grace  with  which  God  accompanied  it. 

The  true  Israelites,  having  been  taught  from  the  tra- 
ditions of  their  ancestors  and  from  the  study  of  the  Holy 
Scriptures,  and  having  been  brought  up  from  infancy 
in  the  knowledge  of  God  and  the  keeping  of  the  law, 
showed  themselves  capable  of  carrying  out  all  the  per- 
fection of  this  teaching,  as  soon  as  this  perfection  was 
revealed  to  them.  They  understood  what  that  salvation 
was  which  the  Messiah  was  about  to  offer  them,  and 
what  his  kingdom  was  going  to  be  like.  But  for  the 
Gentiles  it  was  difficult  to  be  led  to  that  perfection;  ^  for 
up  to  the  time  of  its  revelation  they  had  lived  without 
God  and  without  law,^'  being  guided  by  habit  to  their 
idols,  like  beasts,  wallowing  in  every  iniquity.  And  it 
was  this  which  made  the  Apostles  refrain  from  being 
too  severe  with  the  faithful  among  the  Gentiles.^ 

That  from  J erusalem  Alone  must  the  Worship,  Serv- 
ices, and  Commandments  of  Religion  be  sought 

Since  holy  Jerusalem  is  the  place  where  the  Chris- 
tian religion  came  down,  then  from  its  Christians,  the 
undefiled  Apostles  and  their  successors,  must  we  seek 
the  true  teachings  of  religion,  its  church  orders  and 
regulations,  and  the  services  of  its  divine  worship,  as 
we  are  doing  now.

Christian  Worship 

Christian  worship  differs  in  its  nature  both  from  Jew- 
ish and  from  heathen  worship,  all  of  which  consisted 
of  outward  rites  and  appearances.  But  in  Christianity 
the  essential  element  is  the  worship  of  God  in  spirit 
and  in  truth,  as  the  Saviour  himself  taught/ 

For  this  reason  there  were  introduced  into  the  divine 
service,  as  early  as  the  time  of  the  Apostles,  the  reading 
of  the  Holy  Scriptures,  with  their  interpretation,  the 
Psalms,  prayers,  and  hymns,  with  the  fulfillment  of  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist,  as  in  the  Holy  Book, 
where  it  is  written,  "And  they  continued  steadfastly  in 
the  apostles'  doctrine  and  fellowship,  and  in  the  break- 
ing of  the  bread  and  in  prayers".' 


Places  of  Worship 

Since  it  is  permitted  in  the  Christian  religion  to 
worship  God  not  only  in  Jerusalem,  as  the  Jews  did, 
but  everywhere,  the  Apostles  held  their  worship  wher- 
ever they  found  themselves,  whether  in  the  Temple  at 
Jerusalem,  or  in  private  houses.  It  was  customary  for 
most  homes  in  ancient  times  to  have  a  special  part  set 
aside  for  worship,  in  which  Christians  came  together 
for  prayers  and  the  celebration  of  the  Sacraments,  as 
stated  in  the  Holy  Bible  itself,  "And  they,  continuing 
daily  with  one  accord  in  the  temple,  and  breaking  bread 
from  house  to  house."  From  this  it  appears  that  they 
persevered  in  the  teaching  of  the  Apostles,  by  listening 
to  what  they  taught  them  orally,'"^  whether  in  public  or 
in  private  homes.* 

Breaking  of  Bread  and  the  Agape 

The  breaking  of  bread,  which  is  mentioned  often  in 
the  Gospels,  indicated,  from  the  context,  the  Eucharist

(or  Sacrament  of  Holy  Communion),  and  because  the 
Apostles  were  not  wholly  free  to  minister  this  Sacra- 
ment at  its  proper  times,  and  in  accordance  with  their 
own  wishes  and  direction,  they  used  to  minister  it  in 
homes,  while  outwardly  they  fulfilled  the  Mosaic  law, 
offering  sacrifices,^  which  it  was  unlawful  to  do  except 
in  Jerusalem.  Thus,  since  they  celebrated  the  Euchar- 
istic  Sacrament  in  homes,  and  sometimes  in  the  wilder- 
ness, mountains,  and  caves,  accompanied  by  their  wives 
and  children,  and  since  they  could  not  perform  the  sac- 
rifices and  the  partaking  of  food  together,  there  arose 
among  them  the  tradition  of  holding  a  banquet  which 
they  called  Agape  (which  took  place  after  the  breaking 
of  bread)  or  Love  Feast,  which  took  the  place  of  quiet 
sacrifice.  In  these  agapes,  celebrated  with  joy  and  sim- 
plicity of  heart,  the  worshippers  brought  various  foods 
from  their  homes  to  the  church,  exchanging  them  one 
with  another."  The  Apostles  refer  to  these  agapes  re- 
provingly when  evil  practices  crept  into  them.^ 

In  the  year  70  of  the  Christian  era,  when  Jerusalem 
was  destroyed  by  Titus  the  Roman,  and  when  the  walls 
of  the  city  and  the  Temple  had  fallen,  the  Christians 
fled  from  the  city,  being  warned  of  God.  Then  they 
returned  from  the  city  of  Bala  beyond  the  Jordan  in 
which  they  sought  refuge  from  God's  vengeance,  in 
accordance  with  the  Saviour's  command.^  And  on  the 
ruins  of  old  Jerusalem,  the  kingdom  of  David  and  the 
seat  of  the  kings  of  Judah,  they  built  a  new  and  spiritual 
Jerusalem,  the  kingdom  of  Christ,  the  Son  of  David 
from  the  seed  of  Judah.  Then  it  was  that  the  shadow 
disappeared,  the  symbol  vanished,  the  requirements  of 
the  law,  the  offering  of  sacrifices  and  the  fulfillment  of 
rites  ceased,  and  the  Jewish  religion  was  completely 
abolished.  In  its  place  there  arose  the  truth,  which 
consisted  of  the  saving  sacrifice  of  redemeption,  the 
establishment  of  the  Christian  religion,  and  the  fulfill-

mcnt  of  the  agape  which  had  replaced  the  Mosaic  sac- 
rifices. This  era,  or  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem,  was 
called  by  the  Fathers,  ''The  glorious  burial  of  the  coun- 
cils." ' 

The  offerings  and  sacrifices  of  the  Old  Testament 
were  not  able  in  themselves  to  purify  the  consciences 
of  those  who  ofiPered  them,  but  were  only  for  the  benefit 
of  the  body.  Nor  was  it  possible  for  those  who  offered 
these  sacrifices  to  be  justified  in  their  sins  and  iniquities 
because  of  any  virtue  in  the  sacrifices  themselves,  but 
because  of  the  faith  in  the  coming  Christ  of  those  who 
sacrificed,  and  because  of  the  love  which  accompanied 
these  acts.  To  make  this  plain,  the  Apostles  performed 
the  statutes  of  the  law  and  the  offering  of  sacrifice  in 
the  spirit  of  love  and  unity  for  the  service  of  the  body. 
Then  to  point  out  that  these  statutes  and  that  worship 
were  temporal,  and  that  Christ  by  his  coming  had  insti- 
tuted something  better,  having  offered  himself  a  Sacri- 
fice unto  the  purification  of  souls  and  the  salvation  of 
the  world,  they  coupled  the  two  sacrifices  and  the  ful- 
fillment of  the  rites  of  worship  until  such  time  as  one 
was  abolished.  Thus  they  held  the  agape  which  con- 
sisted of  eating  and  drinking,  signifying  thereby  the 
unity  of  Christians  generally  in  the  one  love,  as  the 
Jews  participated  in  their  outward  rites  for  the  benefit 
of  the  body.^

THE  HOLY  BIBLE 

Faith  in  Christ  presupposes  proclamation  of  him 
(evangel),  which  can  mean  only  the  conforming  of 
the  prophecies  of  the  Old  Testament  to  him  who  is 
proclaimed.  To  fulfill  theif  work  of  prochimation  of 
Christ  the  Apostles  first  started  with  the  translation  of 

lEphcostinus   19th  Epistle.      2  Heb.  9:9-15;    1    Cor.    11:19-22;   23   etc. 


1054  Appendices 

the  Old  Testament,  citing  the  prophecies  therein  to 
show  that  the  proclaimed  One  is  verily  the  Christ  who 
Cometh  for  the  salvation  of  the  world.  That  was  done 
first  orally,  as  their  Master  prompted  them,  and  before 
they  wrote  the  Gospels.  The  first  day  they  undertook 
this  was  after  their  return  from  his  Ascension.  Then, 
ten  days  after,  on  the  Festival  of  Pentecost,  they  began 
their  preaching.  On  the  first  day  they  undertook  their 
Apostolic  office  about  three  thousand  believed  in 
Christ.^  They  continued  preaching  and  spreading  the 
word  of  salvation  in  Jerusalem  and  its  environs,  until 
Saint  Matthew  wrote  his  Gospel  about  the  year  38  A.D. 
And  about  the  year  45  A.D.  they  scattered  throughout 
the  world,  preaching  him,  according  to  their  Master's 
commandment,^  except  St.  John,  who  could  not  leave 
Jerusalem  till  after  the  death  of  the  Theotokos  in  48 
A.D.,  thus  keeping  the  commandment  of  his  Master. 
The  translation  of  the  Holy  Bible,  its  reading  and 
interpretation,  constituted  the  most  important  part  of 
the  Apostles'  preaching:  as  the  reading  of  a  part  of  the 
Gospels  and  Epistles  was  to  them  the  most  essential  part 
of  the  rites  of  worship.  In  the  second  and  third  cen- 
turies the  written  sections  and  readings  were  specified, 
instead  of  being  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  leading 
Priest.  Thus  each  day  was  assigned  its  sections  of  the 
Epistles,  Gospels,  and  other  books.  In  these  two  cen- 
turies also  teaching  replaced  interpretation,  since  the 
book  had  been  translated  into  the  languages  of  those 
who  had  been  Christianized,  into  Syriac  in  the  East  and 
into  Latin  in  the  West. 

THE  APOSTLE,  THE  ELDER,  AND  WHAT  IS 

MEANT  BY  THE  EXPRESSION,  ^^AT 

HIS  DISCRETION" 

The  Apostolic  age  was  distinguished  by  many  things 
not  found  in  any  other  age;  for  it  so  happened  that  the 

lActs  2:41.      2St.  Mt.  28:19;  St.  Mk.  16:15. 


Appendices  1055 

spiritual  services  were  predominantly  in  the  hands  of 
the  Apostles.  But  when  the  number  of  the  faithful 
increased,  and  by  their  dispersion  the  faith  spread  to 
many  parts,  it  was  not  possible  for  them  to  perform 
these  services  at  one  time  in  several  places.  To  facili- 
tate the  propagation  of  the  word  of  salvation  they 
sought  the  help  of  distinguished  persons  among  the 
faithful,  both  men  and  women.  From  this  arose  two 
ranks,  one  for  administration  and  teaching,  which  con- 
sisted of  prophets,  missionaries,  pastors,  and  teachers;^ 
and  the  other  for  the  reception  of  the  seeds  of  faith  and 
its  cultivation  in  constructive  service.  The  first  was 
called  clergy,  and  the  other  was  called  laity.  This  dis- 
tinction, however,  did  not  separate  between  the  faithful, 
but  both  clergy  and  laity  together  constituted  the  one 
Church  of  Christ.  They  were  in  perfect  unity;  for  it 
was  not  the  aim  of  the  first  to  preside,  but  to  benefit; 
and  it  was  not  the  aim  of  the  other  to  revolt,  but  to  assist. 

Now  an  Apostle's  authority  was  not  restricted  to  the 
one  church  which  he  had  founded,  nor  to  the  one  con- 
gregation which  had  accepted  the  faith  at  his  hands. 
His  work  and  authority,  indeed,  prevaded  the  whole 
universe,  since  it  was  his  in  all  its  totality,  as  he  was  for 
the  whole  universe,  in  accordance  with  the  divine  teach- 
ing directed  to  each  of  them  alike,  without  exception, 
as  he  said,  ''Go  ye  into  all  the  world,  and  preach  the 
Gospel  to  every  creature.^ 

Accordingly,  when  the  Apostles  appointed  ecclesias- 
tical ranks  in  the  Church,  they  travelled  throughout  the 
universe  establishing  churches  on  the  pillar  of  their 
calling,  visiting  Christians  wherever  they  happened  to 
be.  And  wherever  an  Apostle  was  found  they  vacated 
for  him  the  first  place,  and  thus  he  would  lead  in  coun- 
sel, administration,  teaching,  interpretation,  preaching, 
the  fulfillment  of  the  Sacraments,  and  the  conducting 
of  worship.  In  short  everything  was  left  to  him.  From 
this  arose  the  expression,  ''At  the  discretion  of  the  eld- 


M   Cor.   12:29-30;  Eph.   4:11.      2  St.  Mark  16:15.

er,"  or,  ''Then  the  elder  saith",  whether  the  elder  hap- 
pened to  be  a  Patriarch  among  Bishops, a  Bishop  among 
Priests,  an  abbot  among  monks,  or  an  elderly  person 
who  leads  the  laity  in  prayer  when  there  are  no  clergy. 
It  also  follows  from  what  has  preceded  that  the 
churches  founded  by  the  Apostles  are  first  in  order 
among  all  churches,  being  the  mothers  from  which 
were  born  the  rest  of  the  churches.  The  organization 
of  these  churches  is  the  pattern  for  all  organization, 
and  the  true  seat  of  authority  for  the  true  teaching  of 
the  Gospel,  for  ruling  on  true  doctrines,  and  they  are 
examples  for  the  order  of  Church  rites.  This  is  all 
so  because  these  churches  received  the  Gospel  and  the 
true  faith  in  Christ  from  the  Apostles  and  from  the 
traditions  which  they  deposited  in  these  churches,  as  is 
affirmed  by  the  God-mantled  Ignatius  in  his  F^pistte  lu 
the  Ephesians,  in  that  he  ''urged  the  congregation  of 
the  faithful  to  preserve  the  apostolic  traditions,  to  be 
united  as  members  of  one  body  whose  head  is  Christ, 
to  observe  faithfully  their  holy  meetings,  open  for  all, 
communing  in  the  offering  of  prayers  and  offerings, 
showing  good  obedience  to  the  Bishops  and  Priests,  in 
accordance  with  the  ordination  which  Christ  himself 
ordained,  and  that  those  who  do  not  obey  the  Bishop 
and  unite  with  him  and  with  one  another,  nor  meet  in 
the  public  prayers  under  his  leadership,  are  hence  cast 
outside  the  Church  and  denied  the  heavenly  bread."  ^ 

DIVISION  OF  TIME  AND  SPECIFICATION 
OF  THE  HOURS  OF  PRAYER 

Moses,  the  Prophet  and  great  lawgiver  at  the  com- 
mand of  God,  ordained  the  rites  of  worship  for  his 
people  Israel.  He  instituted  festivals  for  them,  and 
designated  times  of  prayer,  that,  with  the  beauty  of 
those  rites  and  publicly  recited  prayers,  he  might  lead 
them  to  worship  and  reverence  their  Creator.  Besides 
cultivating  them  niid   teaching  them,  these  ceremonies 

iSt.  Lk.   10:16. 


Appendices  1057 

had  the  effect  of  bringing  them  together  as  one  tribe 
and  one  league.  From  time  to  time  they  alsp  provided 
rest  for  their  bodies,  felicity  of  life,  and  an  opportunity 
for  thanksgiving  for  what  God  had  bestowed  upon 
them  of  his  abundant  favours.  All  this  was  carried  out 
in  accordance  with  the  Mosaic  law  which  was  read  to 
them  and  explained  while  the  religious  ceremonies  and 
festivities  were  going  on. 

Moses  commanded  them  to  be  strict  in  their  perform- 
ance of  those  precepts  which  he  had  enacted  for  them 
in  his  law.  And  in  accordance  with  God's  command, 
they  carried  out  all  the  precepts,  rites,  worship,  acts 
of  piety,  sacrifices,  offerings,  and  festivities,  which  acted 
as  reminders,  and  through  which  they  gave  thanks  to 
God  who  had  established  these  things  for  their  sakes. 

In  order  to  set  definite  times  for  the  performance  of 
those  prayers,  and  that  worship,  which  were  going  on 
day  and  night  in  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  and  in  the 
Temple,  they  computed  their  day  from  sunset  to  sun- 
set, i.e.,  into  two  divisions,  day  and  night,  as  was  men- 
tioned in  Genesis,  '^And  it  was  evening  and  it  was  morn- 
ins:,  one  day".^  Likewise,  Moses  commanded  them, 
''From  even  unto  even,  shall  ye  celebrate  your  sab- 
bath." -  And  since  this  was  exhausting  to  them,  they  aft- 
erwards divided  the  dav  into  six  unequal  watches.  The 
first  of  these  was  called  the  dawn;^  the  second,  morn, 
which  was  at  the  rise  of  the  sun  from  the  horizon;^  the 
third,  the  course  of  the  day,  which  began  about  nine 
a.m.:  the  fourth,  noon;"^  the  fifth,  the  cool  of  day,  so 
called  because  in  eastern  countries  a  breeze  blew  every 
day  between  afternoon  and  nightfall/'  and  the  sixth, 
nightfall,  which  was  from  suset  to  dusk,  when  darkness 
covers  the  face  of  the  earth. 

They  observed  this  division  of  time  till  the  time  of 
Christ,  when  they  followed  the  Roman  method  divid-

ing  the  night  into  four  watches.  The  first  of  these  be- 
gan at  sunset  and  continued  three  hours,  and  was  known 
as  evening;^  the  second  ended  at  midnight,  and  hence 
was  called  midnight;^  the  third  continued  from  mid- 
night until  the  third  hour  after  midnight,  and  was 
known  as  cockcrowing;  ^  and  the  fourth  ended  at  sun- 
rise, and  was  known  as  dawn.^ 

In  like  manner  they  divided  the  day  into  four  periods, 
each  consisting  of  three  hours.  The  first,  which  was 
called  the  first  hour,  began  at  sunrise  and  continued 
three  hours;  the  second  was  called  the  third  hour,  after 
sunrise  till  noon;  the  third  was  known  as  the  sixth 
hour,  beginning  at  noon  and  ending  at  the  third  hour 
in  the  afternoon;  and  the  fourth  was  known  as  the  ninth 
hour,  which  continued  through  the  rest  of  the  afternoon 
till  sunset,  so  that  the  last  hour  in  these  divisions,  which 
Ozone  called  trihorae  (consisting  of  three  hours)  co- 
incided with  the  twelfth  hour  of  the  day.  The  third, 
sixth,  and  ninth  hours  are  mentioned  as  times  of  prayer.'' 

Number  of  Prayers  and  How  the  Prayers  of  the 
Hours  Began 

From  this  followed  the  courses  of  service,  which  ac- 
companied the  hours  of  prayer,  in  accordance  with  the 
shifts  in  the  lots  of  the  worshippers,  the  psalmists,  and 
those  who  performed  the  tasks  of  worship,  and  the  rest 
of  the  services,  and  from  which  came  the  names  of  the 
services  of  the  canonical  hours,  and  the  number  of  these 
services.  The  Prophet  David  refers  to  them  when  he 
says,  ^'Seven  times  a  day  do  I  praise  thee  because  of  thy 
righteous  judgments."  The  names  and  order  of  these 
times  of  prayer  are,  Vespers,  Compline,  Midnight 
Prayer,  Matins,  Prime,  Terce,  Sext,  and  lastly  None. 
The  Prophet  David  mentioned  them  separately  when 
he  said,  ''Evening  and  morning,  and  at  noon,  will  I

couch  with  my  tears",-  and,  ''That  which  ye  say  in  your 
hearts,  ye  shall  repent  in  your  beds."'^  And  of  the 
Midnight  Prayer  he  said,  "At  midnight  will  I  rise 
to  give  thanks  unto  thee  because  of  thy  righteous 
judgments.'"*  And  of  the  Morning  Prayer  or 
Matins,  he  said,  "When  I  remember  thee  upon  my  bed, 
and  meditate  on  thee  in  the  night  watches."  '"  Again 
of  the  Prayer  of  the  First  Hour,  or  Prime,  he  said,  "My 
voice  shalt  thou  hear  in  the  morning,  O  Lord;  in  the 
morning  will  I  direct  my  prayer  unto  thee,  and  will 
look  up."  ^'  The  venerable  Clement  also  mentioned 
these  prayers  under  the  twenty-fourth  caption  of  his 
Canons  of  the  Saints. 

Following  the  example  of  the  church  of  the  Old  Tes- 
tament, the  Christian  Church  adopted  the  times  of 
prayer  from  the  Israelites,  including  in  them  references 
to  events  taken  from  Christian  history.  The  arrange- 
ment of  the  Offices  in  these  prayers  was  followed  with 
strict  observance  in  reference  to  the  Master's  Passion, 
and  thev  were  fulfilled  at  seven  different  times.  Hence 
The  Midnight  Praver  commemorates  that  night  on 
which  Christ  the  Master  was  delivered  to  the  Jews, 
who  came  with  lamps  and  sticks;  Matins  commemorates 
that  dawn  when  Christ  was  mocked  and  ridiculed;  i\\t 
Prayer  of  the  First  Hour,  or  Prime,  commemorates  his 
delivery  to  the  Gentiles.  In  the  third  and  sixth  hours 
he  was  condemned  to  death  and  crucified;  while  in  the 
ninth  he  gave  up  the  ^host.  Vespers  commemorates 
the  descent  of  his  body  from  the  Cross,  and  Compline 
commemorates  his  Burial,  as  we  shall  see. 

Prayer  of  the  Ninth  Hour,  or  None,  and  its 
Explanation

Vesper  Prayer  because  it  is  the  concluding  office  of 
the  ecclesiastical  day.  This  the  Church  received  from 
the  Apostolic  Saints,  setting  it  aside  for  the  memory  of 
the.  Death  of  Christ,  our  Lord  and  God,  who  tasted 
death  in  the  flesh  in  the  ninth  hour  of  the  day,  that 
therewith  he  might  bestow  upon  us  mercy,  truth,  grace, 
glory,  and  dwelling  in  the  Lord's  mansions,  with  refer- 
ence to  the  fruits  of  justification  which  the  faithful  re- 
ceived from  the  ancestral  sin,  and  to  our  reconciliation 
with  divine  justice  and  our  deliverance  from  hades.  As 
it  also  refers  to  the  sign  of  the  precious  cross,  which 
assists  the  faithful  and  frightens  their  enemies,  visible 
and  invisible,  reminding  us  also  of  the  Saviour's  Death 
on  the  Cross.  All  this  is  referred  to  in  the  Psalms  of  the 
Ninth  Hour  Prayer,^  along  with  the  Troparia,  Kon- 
takions,  and  the  prayer  beginning,  '^O  Master  and  Lord 
Jesus  Christ",  etc. 

Explanation   of  Vespers,  or  Sunset  Prayer 

Saint  Clement  received  from  his  teacher,  Saint  Peter 
the  Apostle,  all  the  doctrines  of  faith,  the  rites  of  wor- 
ship, their  noble  offices  and  services  and  their  holy  pray- 
ers. Hence  he  commands  us,  saying,  '^The  offerings 
and  services  must  not  be  fulfilled  as  they  come,  but  in 
order,  and  at  set  times  and  hours."  Likewise  the  Coun- 
cil of  Laodicea  (Eski-Shahr)  which  was  held  in  the 
year  367,  says  in  its  eighteenth  canon,  '^The  prayers  re- 
cited at  the  Ninth  Hour  and  at  evening  must  always 
be  the  same  in  order  that  the  human  mind  which  is 
subject  to  passion  and  enamoured  by  the  seductions  of 
its  conflicting  imaginations,  and  which  goes  after  its 
endless  inclinations,  may  not  overrule  the  everlasting 
and  ever  true  ordinances  of  God." 

Beginning/  of  the  Day 
Further  Explanation  of  the  Vesper  Prayer 
As  we  saw  previously,  the  day's  beginning  was  com- 
puted from  the  evening,  as  it  is  said  in  the  Holy  Book, 

J  Ps.   83:1,   4,    10-12:   84:2,   3,    11;   85:3,   17. 


Appendices  1061 

'S\n(]  it  was  even  and  it  was  morn,  one  day."  ^  Ilencj 
(he  Church  considers  the  beginning  of  her  day  the 
Evening  or  Vesper  Prayer,  in  memory  of  the  beginning 
of  the  day  on  which  God  started  the  Creation  of  the 
visible  world. 

And  in  commemoration  of  the  events  of  the  six  days 
of  creation,  the  Church  adopted  the  one  hundred  and 
tTiird  Psalm,  which  begins,  ^'Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul," 
and  which  refers  clearly  and  plainly  to  all  the  events 
of  creation,  from  the  creation  of  light  to  the  creation 
of  man,  with  symbols  clearly  indicating  the  symbolized 
events. 

Similarly  in  the  service  of  this  Prayer,  the  Holy  of 
Holies  symbolizes  the  interior  of  paradise;  the  Temple 
(where  the  congregation  stand)  symbolizes  the  out- 
side of  paradise;  the  removal  of  the  curtain  from  the 
Royal  Door,  or  opening  it,  symbolizes  our  forefathers 
within  paradise  while  the  doors  were  open;  the  closing 
of  the  curtain  of  the  Royal  Door,  symbolizes  the  clos- 
ing of  the  gates  of  paradise  after  our  forefathers  were 
expelled  therefrom;  the  Priest  standing  bareheaded,  in 
front  of  the  Royal  Door,  and  repeating  the  reverential 
prayer  of  the  Sunset  Psalm,  symbolizes  the  expulsion 
of  our  forefathers  from  paradise  and  their  standing  in 
front  of  its  gates  outside;  the  repetition  of  the  Peace 
Petitions  and  the  Kathisma  of  the  Psalms,  symbolizes 
their  asking  for  reconciliation  and  forgiveness  of  God, 
and  their  petition  to  return  to  paradise.  The  fact  that 
the  Prayer  consists  solely  of  beseechings  and  supplica- 
tions, with  the  repetition  of  the  Peace  Petitions,  devoid 
of  sacrifices,  signifies  that  our  forefathers'  prayer  was 
likewise,  and  that  the  Vesper  Prayer  is  a  substitute  for 
the  evening  sacrifice  in  the  Old  Covenant."  Hence  we 
chant  the  Psalm,  'Xord,  I  cry  unto  thee;  make  haste 
unto  me;  give  ear  unto  my  voice,  when  I  cry  unto  thee. 
Let  my  prayer  be  set  forth  before  thee  as  incense;  and 
the  lifting  up  of  my  hands  as  the  evening  sacrifice," 


1  Gen.   \:5.     ^  Ez.  9;5.

and  the  rest  of  the  Vesper  Psalms/  Furthermore,  the 
appearance  of  the  Priest,  who  has  been  hidden  within 
the  throne,  and  his  coming  out  in  the  procession  (Eiso- 
dos)  from  the  northern  door  of  the  Holy  of  Holies, 
which  faces  the  Altar,  refers  to  the  fulfillment  of  God's 
promise  to  our  forefathers,  of  the  One  who  should  be 
born  and  should  bruise  the  serpent's  head,^  namely,  the 
God  born  in  Bethlehem,  according  to  the  prophecy  of 
the  Prophet  Micah,^  who  hath  appeared  unto  the  world 
in  the  flesh  having  been  hidden  in  his  Divinity  from 
their  eyes.  The  incense  burner  and  the  Gospels  in  the 
Priest's  hand,  as  he  comes  out  from  the  sanctuary  sig- 
nify that  God  accepted  Adam's  repentance  as  a  scent 
of  sweet  odour,  and  to  the  grace  of  the  most  Holy  Spirit 
which  was  bestowed  on  Adam  and  the  whole  world 
through  the  annunciation  of  the  Gospel  of  the  only  Son 
of  God.  The  lighted  candle  in  front  of  the  Priest, 
while  carrying  the  Gospels,  and  his  standing  in  front 
of  the  open  Royal  Door,  and  his  shouting,  ''Wisdom! 
Let  us  stand  up",  signify  that  the  flame  of  that  spear 
with  which  the  angel  prevented  our  forefathers  from 
entering  paradise^  has  been  quenched  by  the  preaching 
of  the  Baptist  who  preceded  Christ  and  preached  of 
him,  that  he  was  the  Light,  the  Holy  Place,  and  the 
Entrance  into  heaven,'  and  to  the  fact  that  this  has  been 
ours  through  Orthodox  faith  in  the  one  God  of  three 
Persons,  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit.  Hence  after 
the  Priest  enters  to  the  throne,  we  chant  or  recite  the 
trinitarian  evening  hymn  of  thanksgiving,  "O  resplend- 
ent Light,  unto  the  holiness  of  the  Father's  glory  .  .  ." 
which  embraces  all  that  has  been  mentioned  heretofore 
concerning  the  divine  promise  of  the  Saviour's  com- 
ing, his  being  God's  Wisdom  and  his  brilliant  Light. 
Said  St.  Basil  the  Great  concerning  this  thanksgiving 
hymn  (under  Caption  twenty-nine  of  his  Mimar  ser- 
mon) on  the  Holy  Spirit,  "Our  forefathers  thought  it

proper  not  to  accept  the  gift  of  evening  light  in  silence, 
but  to  ofifer  thanksgiving  as  soon  as  it  appeared.  We 
do  not  know  and  cannot  say  who  of  the  Fathers  origi- 
nated these  words  of  evening  thanksgiving,  but  only 
that  the  congregation  from  ancient  times  recited  them, 
nor  did  they  consider  it  blasphemy  for  one  to  say  (in- 
stead), "We  praise  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit, 
God."  And  those  who  believe  that  this  hymn  belongs 
to  Athenogenes,  and  that  he  left  it  as  a  talisman  or 
farewell  speech  to  those  who  were  with  him  as  he  was 
being  led  to  martyrdom,  to  the  fire  that  was  prepared 
for  him,  will  realize  what  faith  the  Martyrs  had  in  the 
Holy  Spirit. 

The  Prokeimenon,  and  the  Rest  of  the  Explanation 
of  the  Vesper  Prayer 

In  order  that  we  may  refer  to  the  faith  of  the  fathers 
of  the  Old  Covenant  in  the  coming  Saviour  we  may  say 
after  the  foregoing,  Prokeimenon,  which  means,  that 
which  had  been  stated  before  by  the  Prophets,  the 
prophecies  and  symbols  with  which  God  was  preparing 
the  world  to  receive  the  Saviour.  Hence,  we  say  after 
the  Prokeimenon  a  verse  of  the  Psalms,  or  recite  the 
Readings  on  the  evenings  of  festivals.  As  for  the  Pro- 
keimenon which  follows  the  Anabathmoi,  it  means, 
Introduction,  and  signifies  a  new  stanza  or  new  tune 
for  new  hymns.  While  the  Prokeimenon  of  the  Epistles 
indicates  that  the  Apostles  who  preached  of  Christ  in 
the  New  Covenant  were  preceded  by  the  Prophets  who 
foretold  His  coming  in  the  New  Testament. 

The  Greater  Ektene,  or  Petitions 

This  term  means  supplication,  or  fervent  prayer  that 
comes  out  of  the  heart,  as  its  opening  words  imply,  ''Let 
us  all  say  with  all  our  souls  and  with  all  our  mind",  etc. 
St.  Basil  the  Great  also  called  it  The  Protracted  Peti- 
tion, and  likewise  St.  Methodius  calls  it.  The  Protracted 


1064  Appendices 

Imploralion,  which  signifies  that  it  was  a  lengthy 
prayer.  However,  it  was  so  designated  not  only  because 
of  its  length  and  its  pervading  and  numerous  petitions, 
but  because  it  is  read  loudly,  with  intonation  and  with 
eagerness  and  utmost  attention;  for  in  it  we  petition 
God  for  mercy,  life,  safety,  health,  and  salvation  for 
all  the  people  of  the  world,  of  all  ranks,  in  their  life 
on  earth.  And  to  each  petition  the  congregation  chants 
thrice,  "Lord,  have  mercy."  Then  we  ask  God  that  he 
keep  our  nights  without  sin,  overshadow  us  with  his 
mercy,  lead  us  to  his  commandments,  make  us  to  un- 
derstand his  statutes,  and  lighten  our  paths  with  the 
decrees  of  his  justice.  This  is  explained  in  the  petition, 
'Prepare  us,  O  Lord,  to  be  preserved  this  evening  with- 
out sin,"  etc.,  as  well  as  from  the  several  evening  peti- 
tions which  begin,  "Let  us  continue  our  petitions  to  the 
Lord,"  and  what  follow  them,  in  which  we  ask  God 
Almighty  to  make  us  ready  to  finish  our  evening  prayer, 
remembering  thereby  the  setting  of  our  life's  sun.  And 
in  it  also  we  ask  God  to  grant  us  all  that  is  good  and 
godly  in  our  worldly  life,  in  preparation  for  our  end. 
To  all  these  petitions  we  respond,  "Grant,  O  Lord." 
Then  we  revert  to  where  we  started,  recalling  our  two 
ancestors  and  their  sin,  which  came  down  to  us,  con- 
fessing our  sins,  before  God,  which  are  the  consequence 
of  our  ancestors'  sin,  beseeching  him  for  forgiveness  and 
salvation  for  our  faith  in  him  as  the  Saviour  who  has 
come,  having  also  saved  our  two  ancestors  with  the  rest 
of  the  patriarchs  of  the  Old  Testament,  who  likewise 
believed  in  him  as  the  coming  Saviour. 


Stichera,  Stic  has,  and  Aposticha 

We  also  sing  hymns  which  we  call  Stichera  and 
which  means  the  Hymns  preceded  by  a  Stichos,  or  a 
corresponding  verse  of  the  Psalms.  Or  for  further  eluci- 
dation, we  may  call  such  a  hymn  the  Sticherous  Hymn, 
in  view  of  the  Stichos  or  verse  which  precedes  it.  Apos- 


Appendices  1065 

ticlia  means  that  which  follows  the  Stichos,  as  the  Eve- 
ning Prayer  also  reminds  us  of  the  bringing  down  of 
the  Saviour's  body  and  its  burial  at  evening. 

And  in  order  that  we  may  point  to  the  end  of  the 
Old  Testament  time,  and  the  substitution  of  the  New 
Testament  in  its  place  by  the  coming  of  the  Saviour, 
we  end  our  Evening  Prayer,  which  comprises  all  the 
events  of  the  Old  Testament  as  we  explained  above,  with 
the  Prayer  of  Simeon  the  Elder,  which  is  the  last  of 
the  prophecies  about  Christ  and  which  comprises  both 
the  truth  and  the  symbol ;  for  the  symbol  is  Simeon  him- 
self, the  last  of  the  Old  Testament  fathers,  and  the  truth 
is  Jesus  Christ,  whom  Simeon,  having  borne  in  his  arms 
and  having  known  by  the  Spirit  that  he  was  the  Lord 
of  the  living  and  of  the  dead,  addressed  saying,  ''Lord, 
now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  according 
to  thy  word;  for  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation, 
which  thou  hast  prepared  before  all  people;  a  light  to 
lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  a  glory  to  thy  people  Israel."  ^ 
Whereupon  we  respond  with.  Holy  God,  and  what  fol- 
lows it,  as  we  make  the  sign  of  the  cross  on  our  fore- 
heads. Then  we  sing  the  Troparion  of  Absolution, 
and  conclude  the  Prayer. 

Trisagion,  or  Holy  God 

In  the  days  of  St.  Proclus  who  succeeded  his  Master 
Chrysostom  in  the  Archbishopric  of  Constantinople,  in 
the  reign  of  Theodosius  the  younger,  in  the  year  434, 
the  people  were  making  a  procession  in  the  streets  of 
Constantinople,  supplicating  God  because  of  a  divine 
threat.  Suddenly  a  little  boy  by  the  name  of  Acacius, 
was  snatched  to  heaven.  And  having  been  restored  to 
the  people,  he  was  heard  to  sing  what  he  had  learned 
from  the  angels  in  heaven:  "Holy  God,  Holy  Mighty, 
Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us."  And  in  this 
fashion  the  divine  threat  ceased. 


1  St.  Lk.  2:29-32. 


1066  Appendices 

This  Trisagion,  or  Thrice-holy  Song,  was  included 
in  the  Acts  if  the  Fourth  Ecumenical  Council,  which 
was  held  in  Chalcedon  in  the  year  451,  to  put  an  end 
to  the  schism  of  the  deluded  Peter  the  Fuller.  From 
that  time  its  use  in  churches  was  ordained.  The  account 
of  the  beatified  Acacius  is  mentioned  by  John  the  Sa- 
baite  to  his  friend  St.  John  the  Ladderite,  and  the  lat- 
ter included  it  in  his  famous  work,  The  Ladder  of 
Virtues, 

The  Sign  of  the  Cross 

St.  Meletius  ascended  the  throne  of  the  Patriarchate 
of  Antioch  by  consent  of  the  Orthodox  and  Arian  Bish- 
ops. Because  of  the  confidence  of  the  Council  in  him, 
they  all,  including  King  Constantius,  agreed  in  writing 
to  accept  the  saint's  interpretation  of  the  verse  in  Solo- 
mon the  Wise  which  says,  ''The  Lord  hath  created  me", 
which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Arians,  referred  to  the  crea- 
tion of  the  Son.  The  saint  said  that  Adam  begat  Seth, 
and  that  the  meaning  of  the  word  created  in  this  verse 
is  to  give  birth,  not  to  create  in  the  usual  sense.  Those 
who  were  present  were  greatly  rejoiced,  and  asked  him 
for  further  proof.  Then  he  raised  three  fingers  of  his 
right  hand,  the  thumb,  the  index,  and  the  middle  finger, 
and  bent  the  other  two,  as  he  said,  ''These  three  fingers 
are  a  symbol  of  the  Trinity."  Then  bending  the  index 
and  middle  fingers  and  leaving  the  thumb  raised,  he 
added,  "And  as  these  fingers  now  are  one,  so  also  the 
Substance  is  one."  The  Arians  were  greatly  enraged 
at  hearing  this,  accusing  St.  Meletius  of  harbouring  the 
heresy  of  Sabellius,  Bishop  of  Pentapolis.  Conspiring 
with  the  king's  viceroy,  they  caused  him  to  be  exiled 
to  his  native  city,  Sebaste. 

It  was  St.  Meletius  who  established  the  custom  of 
making  the  sign  of  the  cross,  which  derives  from  Igna- 
tius the  Martyr,  Partiarch  of  Antioch.  This  sign  is  made 
by  the  faithful  by  drawing  the  shape  of  the  cross  on 
their  bodies,  holding  the  first  three  fingers  of  the  right

hand  together,  as  it  is  prastised  to  this  day  in  the  Ortho- 
dox Church  throughout  the  world.  It  may  also  be  men- 
tioned in  passing  that  the  Jews,  on  the  feast  of  Purim, 
used  to  erect  crosses  over  their  houses,  commemorating 
the  crucifixion  of  Haman,  but  they  were  later  pro- 
hibited from  doing  so. 

Alleluia 

This  word  is  Hebrew  and  means,  ''God  hath  ap- 
peared; praise  ye  him  and  glorify  him";  for  Al  stands 
for  God  who  hath  outwardly  come,  while  El  means 
God.  And  since  this  expression  signifies  the  coming 
of  God  the  Word,  the  Church  ordained  that  it  be  chant- 
ed between  the  reading  of  the  Epistle  and  the  Gospels, 
as  well  as  on  days  of  jubilation,  as  in  the  Antiphonies 
of  the  Dominical  Feasts,  when  we  say,  "Save  us  .  .  . 
that  we  may  sing  unto  thee.  Alleluia."  And  this  is 
sung  in  all  churches  in  the  original  Hebrew  because 
John  in  his  revelation  thus  heard  it  from  the  beatified 
angels.^ 

Bless,  O  Father,  in  the  Name  of  God 

We  read  in  the  Holy  Scriptures,  ''And  the  Lord 
spake  unto  Moses,  saying:  Speak  unto  Aaron  and  unto 
his  sons,  saying.  On  this  wise  ye  shall  bless  the  children 
of  Israel,  saying  unto  them,  the  Lord  bless  thee,  and 
keep  thee;  the  Lord  make  his  face  shine  upon  thee,  and 
be  gracious  unto  thee:  the  Lord  lift  up  his  countenance 
upon  thee,  and  give  thee  peace.  And  they  shall  put 
my  name  upon  the  children  of  Israel;  and  I  will  bless 
them.""  We  gather  the  same  from  David  the  Prophet 
where  he  says,  "God  be  merciful  to  us,  and  bless  us;  and 
cause  his  face  to  shine  upon  us.^  Following,  therefore, 
this  divine  instruction,  concerning  the  manner  in  which 
the  Bishop  or  Priest  should  bless  the  people,  the  holy 
Church  ordained  this  expression,  "Bless,  O  Father,  in 


1  Rev.    19.      -Nu.   6:22  to  end.      -^  Ps.   66:1,

the  Name  of  the  Lord'\  calling  for  the  blessing  of  the 
congregation  in  the  divine  Name.  And  when  the  Priest 
hears  this  from  the  Choir  or  Lector  (reader),  he  re- 
sponds by  saying,  '^Through  the  prayers  of  our  Fathers 
the  saints,  O  Lord  Jesus  Christ  our  God,  have  mercy 
upon  us  and  save  us."  Or  he  may  repeat  the  verse, 
''God  be  merciful  unto  us,"  etc.  And  at  the  final  Bene- 
diction of  the  Prayer  the  Priest,  facing  the  congrega- 
tion and  making  the  sign  of  the  cross  with  the  fingers 
of  his  hand,  says,  "The  blessing  and  the  mercy  of  God 
descend  upon  you",  etc. 

Apolytikion,  or  Conclusion   of  the  Prayer  and  Bene- 
diction [Dismissal) 

The  customary  command  for  dismissal  (Benedic- 
tion) from  the  presence  of  majesty  is  given  either  in  a 
sign  or  in  plain  words.  Similarly  in  the  Church,  the 
congregation  cannot  leave  it  until  they  are  absolved 
finally  from  the  bondage  of  religious  duties,  except  in 
an  emergency.  Then  it  is  that  the  worshippers  are  al- 
lowed to  depart  from  the  divine  presence,  where  their 
spirits  have  been  communing  with  their  Lord,  visibly 
in  the  body  and  invisibly  in  the  spirit. 

This  command  for  dismissal  is  called  in  Greek, 
Apolytikion,  which  means  loosening  or  absolution.  It 
consists  of  a  hymn  or  troparion,  so  named  because  it  is 
sung,  especially  after  the  petition  of  Simeon  the  Right- 
eous who,  having  beheld  Christ  and  known  by  the  Spirit 
that  he  was  the  Lord  of  the  living  and  the  dead  and  that 
it  was  he  who  had  bound  him  in  life  to  the  body,  cried 
out,  "Lord,  now  lettest  thy  servant  depart  in  peace," 
etc.  This  is  then  followed  by,  "Holy  God",  etc.  and 
the  Troparion,  while  the  Priest  says,  "Glory  to  thee,  our 
God,  glory  to  thee",  and  the  rest  of  what  is  ordained  in 
the  lesser  Dismissal  in  Evening  Prayer.  But  the  Major 
Dismissal  in  the  Divine  Liturgy  begins  after  the  Priest 
has  pronounced  the  words,  "Let  us  go  out  in  peace,  of 
thee  we  pray,"  followed  by  the  prayer,  "O  Lord  who 


I

blessest  those  who  bless  thee,"  to  the  end  of  the  Dis- 
missal, as  in  the  service  of  the  Mass. 

This  is  all  in  accordance  with  what  the  Saviour  told 
his  Disciples  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Eucharist,  ''Rise, 
let  us  be  going."  ^  In  the  same  way  James,  the  Lord's 
brother,  at  the  end  of  his  Mass  Service,  says,  ''Let  us 
depart  in  the  peace  of  Christ."  While  St.  Clement  says, 
^'Depart  in  peace." 

Pyramon 

This  means  stopping  at  what  preceded,  before  re- 
sumption of  what  follows.  It  also  signifies  rising  from 
the  slumber  of  inattention  and  apathy  before  resuming 
the  journey  to  God. 

For  the  holy  Church,  in  propitiation  for  the  apathy 
which  overtakes  her  children  during  the  days  of  fast- 
ing, awakens  them  from  their  slumber  and  straightens 
their  path  to  God  on  this  day  which  she  has  called 
Pyramon  (which  means  a  stop,  preparation,  standing, 
or  yesterday).  On  it  the  faithful  prepare  by  absolute 
fasting  and  by  desisting  from  all  worldly  afifairs,  being 
engaged  in  continuous  prayer  for  the  observance  of  the 
following  feast  day.  This  prayer  is  also  called  Hours, 
because  it  exhausts  almost  all  the  hours  of  the  day,  and 
at  the  conclusion  of  it  was  formerly  held  the  service  of 
the  Mass.  And  to  the  present  day  the  Divine  Liturgy 
is  fulfilled  on  the  day  of  Pyramon  at  Vespers.  It  was 
customary  for  the  Byzantine  kings  to  be  present  at  the 
services  throughout  the  hours,  and  hence  they  were  also 
called  by  some  of  the  ancient  church  writers,  The  Royal 
Hours. 

Compline  Prayer 

The  Compline  Prayer,  or  bedtime  prayer,  is  of  two 
kinds,  Great  Compline  and  Little  Compline.  Great 
Compline,  in  turn  has  three  parts.     The  first  of  these 

iSt.  Mt.  26:46. 


1070  Appendices 

begins  with  the  words  of  the  Priest,  "Blessed  be  God", 
etc.,  to  the  end  of  the  Prayer  of  St.  Basil  the  Great, 
"Lord,  Lord,  who  hast  delivered  us  from  every  arrow 
that  flieth  by  day  .  .  ."  In  this  part  the  worshipper 
before  he  falls  to  sleep  contemplates  the  thoughts, 
words,  and  deeds  which  he  has  committed  during  the 
day,  as  it  is  written  by  the  Prophet  David,  "Commune 
with  your  own  heart  upon  your  bed,  and  be  still";  and, 
"All  the  night  make  I  my  bed  to  swim:  I  water  my 
couch  with  my  tears."  ^ 

The  second  part  begins  with,  "Let  us  bow  down", 
thrice,  and  the  Fiftieth  Psalm  and  what  follows  it,  end- 
ing with  the  Prayer  of  St.  Mordarius,  "Master,  God, 
and  Almighty  Father",  thus  indicating  man^s  surrender 
to  divine  Providence,  as  when  the  Prophet  David  says, 
"Unto  thee,  O  Lord,  do  I  lift  up  my  soul";  and,  "Into 
thy  hand  I  commit  my  spirit."  ^ 

The  third  part  begins  with,  "Let  us  bow  down", 
thrice,  and  the  Sixty-ninth  Psalm,  "Make  haste,  O  God, 
to  deliver  me",  and  what  follows  it,  to  the  end  of  the 
prayer,  "Forgive,  O  Lord,  those  who  hate  us  .  .  .",  thus 
petitioning  God  not  to  let  us  fall  into  the  slumber  of 
sin,  to  raise  us  from  sleep  safe  and  sound,  walking  in 
the  way  of  his  commandments,  as  it  is  said  in  the  Psalm, 
"Lighten  mine  eyes,  lest  I  sleep  the  sleep  of  death. 
Look  upon  mine  affliction  and  my  pain;  and  forgive 
all  my  sins."  ^ 

Great  Compline  in  general  reminds  us  of  the  setting 
of  our  life's  sun  on  this  earth,  and  that  sleep  is  tem- 
porary death  and  an  example  of  eternal  death.  It  re- 
minds us  that  Christ  at  such  a  time  was  in  hades  saving 
the  righteous  and  the  saints  who  were  expecting  his 
presence.  Our  rising  from  sleep  in  the  morning,  and 
the  succession  of  days  and  nights  also  afiford  us  a  per- 
ceptible proof  of  our  belief  in  the  resurrection  of  the 
dead  and  of  the  life  to  come.     From  this  Great  Com-

pline,  which  is  repeated  on  the  days  of  the  Great  Fast, 
the  Church  produced  Little  Compline,  to  be  repeated 
before  we  go  to  sleep,  from  which  we  might  never  rise, 
seeking  God's  forgiveness  of  our  shortcomings,  and 
petitioning  his  pardon,  mercy,  and  pleasure,  showing 
thereby  our  remorse  and  repentance.  For  the  fulfill- 
ment of  these  three  objects  Little  Compline  adopted 
from  the  first  part  of  Great  Compline  the  Creed  of 
Faith;  from  the  second,  the  Fiftieth  Psalm;  and  almost 
the  whole  of  the  third  part. 

Midnight   Prayer,   Sometimes    Called   the   Prayer    of 

Watching,  or  Agrypinia,  or  the  Prayer  of  the 

Five  Loaves:  and  how  Singing  by  the 

Choir  Alternately  was  Introduced 

Christian  teachings  enjoin  us,  ''To  pray  always'';^ 
but  in  order  that  the  people  may  attain  at  least  their 
daily  nutrition  of  prayer,  the  Apostles  designated  set 
prayers  at  the  third,  sixth,  and  ninth  hours.  Afterwards 
they  added  the  Midnight  Prayer.  The  introduction 
of  this  Prayer  goes  back  to  the  times  of  the  Apostles 
themselves.  When  Herod  the  king  found  that  the  kill- 
ing of  James,  the  brother  of  John,  was  pleasing  to  the 
Jews,  he  laid  hands  on  Peter  also,  whom  he  planned 
to  present  to  them  after  the  Passover.  And  while  Peter 
was  chained  between  two  soldiers  in  prison,  the  Church 
was  praying  ceaselessly  for  him.  And  while  the  faith- 
ful were  thus  engaged,  Peter  knocked  at  the  door  where 
they  were  gathered;  for  an  angel  of  the  Lord  had  de- 
livered him.  In  the  same  manner  the  Apostles  Paul 
and  Silas,  having  been  beaten  almost  to  death  and  thrust 
into  prison,  were  praying  and  praising  God  at  mid- 
night. Suddenly  there  was  a  great  earthquake  which 
shook  the  foundation  of  the  prison  and  set  the  Apostles 
free.^ 

On  the  strength  of  these  two  events,  which  establish 
the  efficacy  of  prayer  and  piety,  the  Church  instituted

1072  Appendices 

the  Midnight  Prayer,  in  imitation  of  the  Apostles. 
From  that  time  there  grew  the  custom  of  meeting  at 
night  for  prayer/  And  sometimes  the  faithful  spent  the 
whole  night  worshipping  God,  as  in  the  Pyramon  of 
Easter.  In  the  fourth  century  Vespers  were  joined  to 
the  night  prayer  in  the  monasteries,  and  the  two  were 
then  called  the  Prayer  of  Watching,  or  the  Prayer  of 
the  Five  Loaves,  and  in  Greek,  Agrypinia.  This 
prayer,  or  service,  was  held  on  Sundays  and  feast  days 
and  other  nights  according  to  the  Abbot's  wish,  as  we 
find  in  the  Typicon,  the  Great  Euchologia,  and  the 
Apostolic  Regulations.  This  custom  is  also  mentioned 
by  most  of  the  church  Fathers  and  teachers,  among 
them  John  Chrysostom,  who  says,  ''Go  into  the  temple 
and  see  the  poor  standing  there  from  midnight  until 
the  morn,  and  listen  to  the  services  of  the  holy  watches 
which  join  the  day  to  the  night."  In  another  place  he 
says,  ''I  rejoice  at  your  zeal  towards  your  Mother,  the 
Church,  and  because  you  stand  without  rest  throughout 
the  night  prayer,  offering  articulate  glorification  to 
the  Creator."  ^ 

In  Milan,  Italy,  the  Midnight  Prayer  took  rise  in 
the  days  of  St.  Ambrose,  when  it  was  feared  that  King 
Valentinian  II  sought  his  exile.  The  faithful  then 
gathered  in  the  church  and  remained  there  several  days 
and  nights,  singing  hymns  and  Psalms,  and  keeping 
watch  all  the  time  with  a  resolute  determination  to 
guard  their  saintly  Bishop,  ready  to  bear  any  hardship 
rather  than  allow  him  to  be  led  out  of  his  house.  In 
order  that  the  congregation  might  not  tire  at  night,  the 
saint  ordered  that  the  two  choirs  should  chant  alter- 
nately, as  the  Eastern  Church  had  done  for  generations 
before.    In  this  way  the  Midnight  Prayer  gradually  be-

came  universal,  as  also  the  chanting  of  the  two  choirs 
in  all  the  western  churches. 


Divisions  of  the  Midnight  Prayer 

There  are  three  Midnight  Prayers  instituted  by  the 
holy  Church:  the  daily  one,  the  one  held  at  midnight 
on  sabbaths,  and  the  one  held  on  Sundays,  also  at  mid- 
night. Each  has  its  own  service,  and  its  own  reference 
to  appropriate  events  of  the  New  Testament. 

The  Daily  Midnight  Prayer 

This  prayer  the  Orthodox  Church  instituted  in  re- 
membrance of  the  Second  Coming  of  the  Lord,  which, 
according  to  the  Gospels,  will  take  place  at  night  sud- 
denly.^ It  was  likened  by  God  to  the  wedding  in  which 
the  ten  virgins  went  out  at  midnight  to  welcome  the 
groom.^ 

In  order  to  arouse  our  interest  and  to  prepare  us  for 
the  Lord's  reception  and  for  meeting  him  face  to  face 
on  that  dreadful  day,  the  Church  urges  us  first  to  bless 
God  by  saying,  ''Blessed  be  God,  our  God",  etc.^  From 
this  we  proceed  to  commune  with  his  Holy  Spirit,  the 
Source  of  all  goodness,  who  fills  the  whole  universe. 
We  entreat  him  to  dwell  in  us  and  cleanse  us  of  our 
impurities,  and  to  save  us  from  ourselves,  as  we  say, 
''O  heavenly  King  and  Comforter",  etc.  And  while  we 
are  thus  carried  up  in  our  communion  with  the  good 
and  comforting  Spirit,  we  lift  up  our  voices  in  the  Tris- 
agion,  or  thrice-holy  song,  saying,  ''Holy  God,  Holy 
Mighty,  Holy  Immortal  One,  have  mercy  upon  us", 
following  the  example  of  the  seraphic  angels  who  praise 
God  constantly,  saying,  "Holy,  Holy,  Holy,  Lord  of 
hosts",  referring  thus  to  the  Trinity  in  the  repetition  of 
the  word,  Holy,  and  the  Unity  in  Substance  by  saying, 
"Lord  of  hosts."

Glory  to  the  Father,  Lord,  Have  Mercy,  and  Amen 

And  since  it  is  this  most  Holy  Spirit  who  speaks 
through  his  Church  and  directs  it,  he  has  led  us  to  the 
necessity  of  seeking  God's  mercy,  by  which  we  have 
our  being,  live,  escape  evil,  and  grow  in  goodness; 
through  whom  we  were  chosen,  called,  and  justified. 
Finally,  it  is  through  God's  mercy  that  we  are  about  to 
be  glorified  by  union  with  him.  It  is  therefore  meet 
that  we  offer  glorification  to  the  most  Holy  Trinity  by 
saying,  "Glory  to  God,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy 
Spirit",  etc.  This,  too,  is  taken  from  the  Apostle  where 
he  says,  "For  of  him,  and  through  him,  and  unto  him, 
are  all  things.  To  him  be  the  glory  for  ever.  Amen."  ^ 
To  this  we  join  our  petition  for  God's  mercy,  as  we 
say,  "Lord,  have  mercy." 

This  last  expression  finds  frequent  use  in  our  holy 
Church;  for  in  its  relation  to  worship,  it  is  in  itself  the 
best  prayer  that  a  creature  could  think  of  to  offer  to 
God,  asking  thereby  his  mercy  and  forgiveness.  Often 
we  repeat  it  hundreds  of  times,  as  in  the  Feast  of  the 
Elevation  of  the  Cross,  simply  to  petition  God's  mercy 
through  which  he  had  raised  us  after  we  were  fallen. 
At  other  times  we  employ  it  to  seek  God's  blessings, 
and  still  at  other  times  to  glorify  him  thereby,  or  to  seek 
forgiveness  for  the  sins  we  have  committed  throughout 
the  twelve  hours  of  the  day.  At  times  also  we  use  it 
as  a  propitiation  for  the  days  of  the  year,  which  fall  a 
little  short  of  four  hundred.  This  brief  petition  goes 
back  to  the  days  of  the  Apostles,  when  they  instituted 
the  Divine  Liturgy,  as  we  gather  from  the  commen-- 
taries  of  St.  Jerome  and  St.  Cyprian.^  Similarly,  the 
word  Amen,  which  is  also  taken  from  the  Apostle, 
where  he  says,  "Else  if  thou  bless  with  the  spirit,  how 
shall  he  that  filleth  the  place  of  the  unlearned  say  Amen 
at  thy  giving  of  thanks?"  ^

Appendices  1075 

Now,  since  the  seeking  of  God's  mercy  and  forgive- 
ness necessitates  penitence  and  repentance,  the  Church 
decreed  the  recital  of  the  Fiftieth  Psalm.  And  in  order 
that  she  may  lead  us  to  purity  of  heart,  cleanliness  of 
conduct,  and  to  seek  refuge  in  righteousness  and  the 
keeping  of  God's  commandments,  she  ordained  also  the 
recitation  of  the  1 18th  Psalm,  ''Blessed  are  they  that  are 
perfect  in  the  way".  This  is  followed  by  confession 
of  our  true  Orthodox  Faith  by  reciting  the  Creed,  which 
was  compiled  in  the  First  and  Second  Councils  from 
the  teachings  of  the  Scriptures,  and  which  begins,  "I 
believe  in  one  God".  Then  come  the  Troparia  of  the 
Midnight  Prayer,  "Behold,  the  bridegroom  cometh  at 
midnight",  ''Be  alert,  O  my  soul,  on  that  fearful  day, 
and  watch",  and  "Thou  art  a  secure  wall  and  pillar  of 
our  salvation,  O  virgin  Theotokos". 

Then  we  supplicate  God  with  the  prayer,  "O  thou 
who  at  all  times,  and  at  each  hour",  that  God  may  have 
mercy  on  us  and  make  the  end  of  our  faith  union  with 
him  and  the  enjoyment  of  his  glory,  in  accordance  with 
the  saying  of  the  Apostle;  for  the  Apostle  taught  that 
whereas  faith  shall  be  done  away  with  when  it  shall 
have  been  fulfilled  through  union  with  him  in  whom 
we  believe,  and  whereas  hope  shall  cease  when  we  shall 
have  attained  the  glory  that  is  hoped  for,  love  hath  no 
end,  as  there  is  no  end  to  unity  with  God  the  Beloved. 
Thus  we  see  that  because  in  love  there  is  no  separation 
between  man,  who  is  promised  everlasting  unity,  and 
his  Beloved,  who  is  God,  it  achieves  the  distinction  of 
being  the  best  and  greatest  of  all  virtues;  for,  while  all 
other  virtues  are  temporal  in  nature,  love  is  eternal. 
Likewise,  our  knowledge  of  God's  glory  shall  come  to 
an  end,  because  it  stops  in  this  life  with  parables,  hyper- 
boles, and  enigmas,  viewing  it  in  the  mirror  of  faith 
and  the  Scriptures.  But  there,  face  to  face  as  we  are 
known  of  him,  our  clear  knowledge  of  him  shall  take 
its  place.  And  thus  we  understand  the  passage  in  the 
aforesaid  prayer  wherein  we  beg  that  we  may  "arrive 


1076  Appendices 

at  the  unity  of  faith  with  thee,  and  to  the  knowledge  of 
thine  unapproachable  glory."  ^ 

Then  we  beseech  God  by  reciting  the  120th  Psalm. 
''I  will  lift  up  mine  eyes  unto  the  mountains";  and 
the  133rd  Psalm,  ^'Behold,  bless  ye  Jehovah  all  ye 
servants  of  Jehovah",  that  he  will  protect  us  and 
preserve  us  from  all  evil.  Then,  returning  to  our 
Vespers,  we  lift  up  our  hands  to  God  and  ask 
his  blessing.  After  this  we  ask  his  mercy  for  those 
who  have  fallen  asleep,  in  a  prayer  which  begins,  '^Re- 
member, good  Lord",  ''O  thou  who  directest  all  with 
thy  sublime  wisdom",  ''Give  rest,  O  Christ",  "All  gen- 
erations bless  thee,  O  Virgin",  etc.,  and  the  prayer, 
''Remember,  Lord,  those  who  slumber",  etc.  The  Mid- 
night Prayer  is  then  concluded  with  the  little  prayers, 
"O  glorious  and  blessed  one",  "The  Father  is  my  trust", 
"In  thee  have  I  placed  all  my  trust",  followed  by  the 
supplicatory  petitions  for  all  the  living  and  all  who 
have  fallen  asleep  of  the  Orthodox  of  true  worship. 
After  this  the  Elder  says,  "Through  the  prayers  of  our 
Fathers,  the  saints",  etc.,  thus  concluding  the  Prayer. 

Midnight  Prayer  on  Sabbaths 

The  sabbath  is  a  feast  day  pertaining  to  the  church 
of  the  Old  Testament.  To  remind  us,  however,  of  the 
signs,  symbols,  and  rites  which  relate  to  that  day,  the 
Church  of  Christ  designated  another  prayer  especially 
for  the  sabbath.  This  dififers  from  the  ordinary  Mid- 
night Prayer  in  the  following  ways:  Instead  of  the 
1  ]8th  Psalm,  six  Psalms  are  substituted,  from  the  Sixty- 
fourth  to  the  Sixty-ninth  inclusive,  containing  prophe- 
cies of  the  Second  Coming  of  Christ,  bringing  awe  to 
sinners  and  the  wicked,  and  joy  to  the  righteous  and 
just.  Secondly,  instead  of  the  Troparion,  "Behold  the 
bridegroom  cometh  at  midnight",  etc.,  is  sung  the  Tro- 
parion, "Open  our  lips",  etc.,  "We  are  on  earth",  etc., 

i  1  Tim.  6:16. 


Appendices  1077 

^'I'hou  hast  gotten  me  up  from  my  bed".  Thirdly,  after 
the  prayer,  ''We  bless  thee,  O  most  high  God'V  we 
substitute  the  prayer,  ''Verily,  do  I  magnify  thee",  etc.^ 
In  all  this  the  Church  calls  us  to  imitate  the  holy  angels 
who  ceaselessly  praise  God. 

Midnight  Prayer  for  Sundays 

As  for  the  Midnight  Prayer  on  Sundays,  it  was  or- 
dained by  the  Church  to  remind  us  of  the  glorious 
Resurrection  of  Christ,  which  took  place  at  midnight. 
Hence,  instead  of  the  prayers  for  the  dead  and  the 
Psalms,  the  Triodion  (or  song  of  three  tones)  is  sung; 
and,  instead  of  the  Creed,  the  Tridion  beginning,  "It  is 
truly  meet",  etc.;  and  for  the  Troparia,  the  Hypakoe 
is  sung.  Through  these  changes  the  Church  leads  us 
to  the  praise  of  the  most  Holy  Trinity,  and  to  the  glori- 
fication of  him  who  did  rise  from  the  grave  on  the  third 
day,  Christ  God  who  giveth  life  to  all  by  his  holy 
Resurrection. 

Matin  Prayers'^ 

The  most  appropriate  time  for  the  contemplation  of 
the  great  deeds  and  mysteries  of  God,  when  one  is 
moved  to  praise  and  to  sing  unto  him,  is  at  dawn,  when 
one  rises  from  sleep.  It  is  then  that  the  mind  is  at  its 
fullest  power,  having  received  its  sufficiency  of  rest,  as 
the  Psalmist  says,  "My  heart  is  ready,  O  God,  my  heart 
is  ready:  I  will  sing,  yea,  I  will  sing  praises.  Awake  up, 
my  glory,  awake,  psaltery  and  harp:  I  myself  will 
awake  right  early."  ^ 

Thus  the  Prophet  David  indicated  that  his  praise  of 
the  divine  Majesty  was  not  merely  by  word  of  mouth; 
but  also  by  the  awakening  of  his  spirit,  by  the  singing

The  Prophet  refers  here  first  to  the  praise  which  re- 
sults from  the  agitation  of  the  spirit  from  above  down- 
ward by  mentioning  the  psaltery,  which  likewise  is 
played  beginning  with  its  upper  part  downward,  then 
to  the  raising  of  the  voice  in  rejoicing  from  below  up- 
ward, thus  including  the  two  dawns,  the  upper  dawn 
and  the  lower  dawn  or  morn.  In  the  same  way  the 
Church  ordained  the  service  of  Matins,  beginning  from 
above  downward,  i.e.,  beginning  by  blessing  God  the 
Creator,  the  Almighty  and  majestic,  and  with  the  sera- 
phic song  of  praise,  offering  him  glory  and  praying  for 
his  mercy.  Then,  having  descended  to  the  offering  of 
the  necessary  worship  to  him  after  his  Incarnation  on 
earth,  we  ascend,  praying  God  for  the  earthly  king  and 
his  support,  in  accordance  with  the  Apostle's  command 
that  "Supplications,  prayers,  intercessions,  thanksgiv- 
ings, be  made  for  all  men;  for  kings  and  all  that  are  in 
high  places".  'Tor  there  is  no  power  but  of  God;  and 
the  powers  that  be  are  ordainsd  of  God."  ^  All  this 
appears  in  the  saying  of  the  Priest,  ''Blessed  be  God", 
etc.,  followed  by  the  choir's  "Holy  God,"  and  "Lord, 
have  mercy"  {twelve  times)  ^  "Come,  let  us  bow  down" 
{three  times)  ^  and  the  Nineteenth  Psalm,  "Jehovah 
answer  thee  in  the  day  of  trouble",  etc.,  the  Twentieth 
Psalm,  "The  king  shall  joy  in  thy  strength,  O  Jehovah", 
etc.  This  is  then  followed  by  the  Troparia,  "O  Lord, 
save  thy  people",  etc.,  "O  dread  Champion",  etc.,  and 
the  petitions,  "Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God",  etc.,  and 
what  follows  it,  with  which  we  conclude  the  prelude  of 
the  Matin  service  for  kings  and  men  in  authority,  and 
proceed  to  the  Matin  Prayer,  as  the  choir  addresses  the 
Priest,  saying,  "Bless,  O  Father,  in  the  Name  of  the 
Lord."  Then  the  Priest  opens  the  prayer  referring  to 
the  appearance  of  the  Saviour  on  earth,  whom  the  an- 

1  1  Tim.  2:1-4;  Ro.   13:1. 


Appendices  1079 

gels  proclaimed  when  he  was  born  at  night,  thus  indi- 
cating that  before  the  Saviour's  Nativity  we  were  in 
darkness,  contrary  to  the  light  of  faith  with  which  we 
were  lightened  after  his  appearance  on  earth  in  the 
flesh.  This  is  all  understood  from  the  words  of  the 
Priest,  "Glory  to  the  holy,  consubstantial",  etc.,  and  the 
choir's  respond,  ''Glory  to  God  in  the  highest",  etc. 

After  this  we  recite  the  six  Matin  Psalms  in  which 
we  show  our  readiness  to  accept  faith  in  him.  And  thus 
after  we  give  expression  through  those  Psalms  to  the 
acknowledgment  of  our  sins,  confess  them,  and  ask  their 
forgiveness,  and  deliverance  from  our  enemies  who 
compass  us  about,  we  are  then  conscious  of  the  mercies 
of  God  who  suf^fered  his  Son  to  be  sent  to  us,  that  he 
might  reconcile  us  to  the  Father.  This  reconciliation, 
pervading  every  race  and  rank  in  the  world,  is  indi- 
cated in  the  Great  Synapte  in  which  we  say,  ''In  peace 
let  us  pray  to  the  Lord.  For  the  peace  that  is  from 
above  and  for  the  salvation  of  our  souls,  let  us  pray  to 
the  Lord,"  etc. 

The  Great  and  Little  Synaptes 

In  the  first  book  of  his  Epistle,  Isador  of  Pelusium 
says,  "We  must  not  only  secure  peace  among  ourselves, 
but  also  inseparable  unity  with  our  Lord  and  Master." 
Similarly  he  says  in  that  Epistle,  "O  Lord  our  God, 
who  didst  grant  us  peace  and  understanding  one  with 
another,  grant  us  safety  for  our  unity  with  thee,  insep- 
arably, that  we  may  attain  thee  as  peace  through  thy 
Holy  Spirit;  and  that  we  may  be  established  in  thee, 
inseparable  from  thy  love."  Again  St.  John  Chrysos- 
tom,  contemplating  the  Great  Synapte,  wrote  in  the 
sixth  book  of  his  work  on  the  Priesthood,  "What  do  I 
say,  that  the  Priest  prays  for  a  city,  town,  or  village? 
Nay,  he  makes  petition  for  the  whole  universe,  praying 
the  Lord  to  forgive  all  those  who  beseech  him."

These  petitions  are  called  in  Greek  The  Great  Syn- 
apte,  meaning  collection,  because  so  many  of  these  peti- 
tions are  brought  together  and  recited  at  one  time.  They 
are  also  called  peace-petitions,  because  each  one  begins 
with  a  petition  for  peace.  Sometimes  it  is  also  called 
the  Great  Preaching.  The  term  Great  is  used  to  dis- 
tinguish it  from  the  Little  Synapte,  which  opens. its 
petitions  with  the  expression,  ''Again  and  again  in 
peace,  let  us  pray  to  the  Lord." 

After  offering  our  thanks  to  God  who  gave  us  rest 
with  our  night's  sleep  and  aroused  us  early  ^  to  perform 
our  duty  of  praise  and  glorification  for  his  goodness,  he 
having  made  us  worthy  to  behold  our  Saviour,  born  in 
Bethlehem,  and  to  realize  that  he  is  Christ  the  Saviour 
who  cometh  as  light  and  guidance  to  the  world,  and  that 
we  have  been  illumined  by  the  light  of  his  knowledge. 
Hence,  at  the  conclusion  of  the  peace-petitions,  we  sing 
at  once  the  prophetic  passage  which  demonstrates  vis- 
ibly the  coming  up  of  the  true  Sun  of  righteousness,  by 
beholding  the  light  of  day  which  we  shall  have  reached 
at  that  time.  Then  we  say,  "God  the  Lord  hath  ap- 
peared unto  us."  "  As  we  say  this  we  light  the  lamps, 
pointing  thereby  by  the  visible  and  sensible  light  to  the 
invisible  light  of  our  faith  in  the  invisible  Godhead  of 
incarnate  God.  This  prayer,  as  well  as  Vespers,  is  also 
called  the  Prayer  of  Lamps.  This  is  taken  from  the 
custom  of  the  Old  Testament  when  the  priests  used  to 
enter  the  Temple  every  morning  to  offer  incense  and 
put  out  the  lights,  then  return  in  the  evening  and  light 
them.  And  as  in  ancient  times  the  lighting  of  the  lamps 
was  a  reminder  of  the  improvement  of  their  condition, 
and  an  expression  of  their  hearts'  rejoicing  and  gladness, 
so  the  Apostles  also,  as  they  persisted  in  prayers  and 
the  breaking  of  bread,  employed  lighted  lamps  fre- 
quently."^

Tropnnon 

Then  to  give  expression  to  our  faith,  and  our  respect 
to  virtue  and  the  virtuous,  we  sing  a  hymn  which  we 
call  Troparion,  set  to  a  special  tone,  and  made  for  a 
special  occasion  or  person,  from  which  the  attributes  of 
the  subject  of  the  song  are  brought  to  view.  Thus,  if 
the  Troparion  is  for  the  Resurrection,  that  event  is  de- 
scribed for  us  and  its  sequence  made  clear.  If  it  is  for 
a  dominical  feast,  we  learn  from  it  the  event  to  which 
it  refers;  and  if  it  is  for  a  saint,  we  learn  from  it  the 
saint's  great  faith  and  the  sanctity  of  his  life.  And  be- 
cause of  its  appropriate  and  descriptive  nature  the  Tro- 
parion is  also  called  movable  hymn.  The  music  of  the 
Troparion  is  composed  after  one  of  the  eight  tones  of 
the  Resurrection.  The  Troparion  is  followed  by  a 
recital  of  the  Stichologia  of  the  Psalms  and  the  Kathis- 
mata. 

However,  before  we  come  to  the  discussion  of  the 
Psalms,  the  Stichologia  and  the  Kathismata,  we  will  say 
a  word  about  the  tones  and  hymns,  with  the  mention  of 
some  of  the  musical  composers  and  the  authors  of  those 
hymns. 

Tones,  Composers^  and  Hymn  Writers 

When  the  soul  is  moved  by  the  force  of  love,  there 
are  born  therein  motives  of  joy.  And  when  love  takes 
its  eiifect,  these  motives  or  reactions  take  their  course  in 
the  body,  clarifying  the  blood,  bringing  contentment 
to  the  heart,  and  reviving  the  whole  soul.  The  vital 
parts  of  the  body  are  then  moved  with  joy  and  happi- 
ness, and  this  appears  in  the  efiPect  as  voices  of  gladness, 
and  shoutings  of  joy  as  praises  and  hymns  of  thanksgiv- 
ing to  the  Creator,  as  happened  with  David  the 
Prophet;  for  when  David  was  aroused  by  the  joy  that 
comes  from  the  efifect  of  the  love  of  divine  things,  he 
began  to  dance,  to  shout,  and  to  sing  songs  of  praise 
before  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant.^ 


12  Samuel  6:14,  15;    1  Chron.    16:4,   7. 


1082  Appendices 

In  the  same  way  John  the  Evangelist  tells  us  in  his 
Revelation  about  this  joy  which  manifests  itself  in  the 
lifting  of  the  voice  and  in  singing  in  unison,  in  which 
the  heavenly  powers  and  the  souls  of  the  saints  in  heaven 
join  at  the  Lamb's  wedding;  for  we  read,  "And  a  voice 
came  forth  from  the  throne,  saying,  'Give  praise  to  our 
God,  all  ye  servants,  ye  that  fear  him,  the  small  and  the 
great!  And  I  heard  as  it  were  the  voice  of  a  great  mul- 
titude, and  the  voice  of  many  waters,  and  the  voice  of 
mighty  thunders,  saying.  Alleluia:  for  the  Lord  our 
God,  the  Almighty,  reigneth.  Let  us  rejoice  and  be 
exceeding  glad,  and  let  us  give  the  glory  unto  him:  for 
the  marriage  of  the  Lamb  is  come."  ^ 

It  is  obvious  from  this  that  what  aflects  the  soul,  and 
and  what  the  spirit  yearns  to,  by  the  efifect  of  love,  joy, 
and  rejoicing,  is  natural  unto  it  as  a  living,  rational  be- 
ing. It  also  indicates  that  the  propensity  for  merri- 
ment is  a  vestige  of  speech,  which  the  soul,  failing  to 
express  in  measured  words  by  the  tongue,  gives  expres- 
sion to  by  rhythm.  The  melodious  consonance  of  the 
voice,  sometimes  imitating  the  voices  of  doves  or  other 
birds,  and  measured  in  accordance  with  time,  volume, 
modality,  frequency  of  trilling,  emphasis,  repetition, 
etc.,  is  accordingly  called  singing,  when  in  the  form  of 
poetry;  and  chanting,  when  in  the  form  of  prose. 

The  church  Fathers,  especially  those  who  were  musi- 
cians, realized  the  importance  of  music  in  the  church 
services.  They  knew  its  effect  on  the  soul,  the  mental 
pleasure  it  gives,  the  ecstacy,  the  joy,  the  elevation  from 
earthly  things,  the  unity  with  the  ranks  of  the  angels, 
and  the  acknowledgment  of  the  Creator's  Godhead.  To 
proclaim  God's  benevolence  in  songs  of  thanksgiving 
and  praise,  the  holy  Fathers  began  composing  spiritual 
songs  and  hymns,  thus  leading  the  faithful  to  God,  and 
away  from  the  defilements  of  worldly  and  heathen 
songs,  and  from  heresy. 


iRev.  19:5-7. 


Appendices  1083 

Among  those  who  thus  set  about  to  counteract  the 
popular  songs  of  their  day  were  Ephram  the  Syriac, 
the  Three  Luminaries,  Ambrose  of  Milan,  Anatolius 
of  Constantinople,  author  of  the  Stichoi  for  Sundays 
and  Holidays,  who  died  in  458,  Romanus  the  Melo- 
dious, author  of  most  of  the  Kontakions  and  the  type  of 
song  known  as  the  Oikos,  who  died  in  510;  Gregory 
Dialogus,  who  introduced  modern  tunes  into  the  west- 
ern church,  and  who  died  in  604;  and  Sophronius  of 
Jerusalem,  who  died  in  641. 

Singing,  and  the  Appearance  of  the  Two  Choirs 

When  it  was  first  introduced,  singing  in  the  church 
was  by  the  whole  congregation,  as  we  gather  from  St. 
Cyprian  in  his  book  on  Prayer,  where  he  says  that  when 
the  Priest  called  out,  "Let  us  lift  up  our  hearts,"  the 
congregation  responded,  "Our  hearts  are  with  the 
Lord."  Similarly  St.  Jerome,  who  was  a  pupil  of 
Gregory  Theologus,  in  his  Epistle  to  the  People  of 
Galatia  says,  "Often  when  the  congregation  of  a  church 
responded  with  an  'Amen'  or  'Lord,  have  mercy',  you 
could  hear  a  rumbling  like  that  of  thunder." 

But  to  avoid  confusion  and  noise  in  a  sacred  place, 
the  Fathers  of  the  Council  of  Laodicea,  which  was  held 
in  364,  ordained  that  only  Priests  participate  in  the 
chanting  and  singing,  assisted  by  the  choirs  singing 
antiphonally.^ 

In  the  eighth  chapter  of  his  sixth  book,  Isocrates  men- 
tions that  the  author  of  this  rite,  as  well  as  the  complete 
service,  was  the  great  among  martyrs,  Ignatius. 

Then  when  St.  John  of  Damascus  came,  he  found 
that  the  natural  voices  are  eight  in  number,  which  he 
called  a  scale,  ascending  and  descending  with  the  voice 
into  octaves.  From  this  scale  he  adopted  eight  tones, 
which  he  called  the  principal  tones.  He  was  not  satis- 
fied with  this,  however,  elaborating  on  each  tone  and

1084  Appendices 

creating  several  tunes.  In  this  he  was  followed  by  suc- 
ceeding musicians  until  the  number  of  tunes  ran  into 
hundreds.  St.  John  of  Damascus  died  in  760.  Along 
with  his  friend  and  companion,  St.  Cosma  of  Jerusalem, 
he  enriched  the  Church  with  hundreds  of  spiritual 
songs  and  hymns. 

Prosomion  and  Idiomelon 

Among  the  tunes  introduced  by  the  Church  is  one 
called  Prosomion,  which  means  a  Troparion  sung  after 
the  rhythm  of  an  original  Troparion.  The  Greek  word 
means  resemblance,  and  the  tune  of  the  Prosomion  is 
according  to  musical  beats.  An  Idiomelon,  on  the  other 
hand,  is  a  Troparion  which  has  its  own  tune,  and  is 
sung  in  a  long  drawn  out  fashion. 


The  Psalms,  and  their  Use  in  the  Church 

The  Book  of  Psalms  is  a  collection  of  poems;  songs, 
hymns,  and  paeans,  written  by  God's  inspiration.  It  is 
the  most  important  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  among  the 
Hebrews,  an  inexhaustible  treasure  of  divine  praise 
for  all  the  ages. 

The  Hebrews  divided  the  Psalms  into  five  parts:  the 
first  from  the  first  Psalm  to  the  forty-first;  the  second 
from  the  forty-second  to  the  seventy-second;  the  third 
from  the  seventy-third  to  the  eighty-ninth;  the  fourth 
from  the  nintieth  to  the  one  hundred  and  seventh;  and 
the  fifth  part  from  the  hundred  and  eighth  to  the  hun- 
dred and  fiftieth.  This  corresponded,  according  to 
them,  to  the  ^wt  external  senses  of  man  and  the  ^wc  in- 
ternal forces,  and  in  the  recital  of  these  Psalms  the 
senses  and   forces  are  blessed  and  sanctified. 

The  Bible  informs  us  that  the  Prophet  David  ap- 
pointed two  hundred  and  eighty-eight  men,  whom  he 
divided  into  twenty-four  lots,  presided  over  by  twenty- 
four  men  consisting  of  Asaph,  Heman,  Jeduthun,  and 


Appendices  l()S5 

their  sons.  Kach  lot  consisted  of  twelve  men  to  sing, 
praise,  and  sanctify  God  in  the  Tabernacle,  and  later  in 
the  Temple  of  Jerusalem/  Some  of  the  Psalms  were 
individual  in  nature,  and  some  composed  for  the  con- 
gregation, suiting  the  whole  body  of  worshippers,  and 
sung  in  unison  by  them.  The  Prophet  David  set  tunes 
to  the  Psalms  in  order  that  they  might  be  delectable  to 
the  senses,  bringing  contentment  to  the  soul,  and  drawl- 
ing it  away  from  carnal  songs  to  the  service  of  the 
Creator  and  the  doing  of  his  pleasure.  Thus  the  body 
is  attracted  to  the  tune  while  the  mind  is  attracted  to 
the  meaning  of  the  Psalm.  The  Psalms,  therefore,  with 
their  tunes,  each  fitting  the  other,  are  like  a  medicine 
which  one  mixes  for  a  sick  man  until  he  regains  his 
health,  after  which  he  goes  about  his  duties. 

For  this  reason  the  Psalms  were  used  in  the  Church 
from  the  days  of  the  Apostles,  who  adopted  them  and 
were  accustomed  to  them  from  the  old  Covenant.  The 
Church  persisted  in  the  use  of  the  Psalms,  winning  the 
faithful  to  them;"  for  in  the  Psalms  were  found  in 
compact  form  things  that  were  scattered  throughout 
the  rest  of  the  divine  books — commandments,  prohibi- 
tions, interpretations,  sermons,  warnings,  and  informa- 
tion about  creatures  that  lead  to  the  Creator. Withal  they 
are  consolation  to  the  sorrowful,  courage  to  the  perse- 
cuted, an  aid  to  the  afflicted,  a  bridle  to  the  wicked,  a 
humbling  of  the  strong,  and  a  stimulation  to  patience  in 
times  of  distress.  They  prophesy  of  Christ  the  Master 
and  his  entire  dispensation.  In  truth,  the  Psalms  are 
like  a  paradise  full  of  fruitful  trees.  And  besides  using 
them  in  their  prayers,  the  faithful  were  commanded  by 
the  Apostles  to  use  them  also  in  their  conversation  one 
with  another.'^ 

Stichologia,  the  Kathisma,  and  the  Divisions 
of  the  Psalms 
The  Christians  who  came  after  the  Apostles  were 
very  fond  of  the  Psalms.    They  divided  them  into  twen- 

1  1   Chr.   25.      -  Er'i-   5:19.      -"^  Col.   3:16. 


1086  Appendices 

ty  parts,  each  part  consisting  usually  of  six  or  seven 
Psalms,  which  they  called  stichologia,  meaning  a  cer- 
tain number  or  collection  of  Psalms.  Then  they  dis- 
tributed these  stichologias  into  seven  divisions,  after  the 
seven  Matins  of  the  week  thus:  For  Sunday  Vespers, 
one:  for  Matins  of  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday, 
Thursday,  and  Friday,  three  each;  and  for  Saturday 
Matins,  two.  Each  stichologia  in  turn  was  divided 
into  three  stages  of  a  few  Psalms  each,  followed  by 
''Glory";  ^  after  which  we  ask  God's  mercy,  and  resume 
the  recitation  of  the  Psalms.  At  the  end  of  the  third 
stage  we  sing  a  hymn  which  we  call  Kathisma  {pi. 
Kathismata)  which  means  sitting,  because  it  is  permis- 
sible for  the  congregation  to  sit  while  it  is  sung,  and  to 
take  a  little  rest. 

This  division  of  the  Psalms  is  very  old,  going  back 
to  a  time  before  the  Council  of  Laodicea  (ad  Lycum, 
called  Eski  Hissar  by  the  Turks,  and  meaning  the  Old 
Castle)  which  was  held  in  the  year  364;  for  in  the  sev- 
enteenth canon  of  that  Council  we  are  told  that  "The 
Psalms  should  not  be  read  continuously  in  the  churches, 
but  between  one  Psalm  and  another  there  should  be 
inserted  some  reading." 

Anabathmoi 
When  the  Hebrews  were  released  from  their  captiv- 
ity in  Babylon,  they  returned  to  Jerusalem,  ascending, 
because  Jerusalem  was  higher  than  Babylon.  And  as 
they  ascended  they  sang  Psalms  which  Symmachus  and 
Theodotion  called  Ascension  Hymns,  and  which  the 
Seventy,  who  translated  the  Old  Testament,  called 
Praise  Songs  of  the  Ascension.  These  Psalms,  which 
were  sung  in  praise  of  God,  were  fifteen  in  number,  be- 
ginning with  the  One  Hundred  and  Nineteenth  Psalm. 
They  sang  these  Psalms  at  the  various  stations  where 
they  rested,  and  hence  they  were  also  called  Resting 
Psalms. 


1  Since    the    recitation    of   Glory    comes   alternately    from    the    two    choirs   it 
is  also  called  Antiphony. 


Appendices  1087 

When  the  Israelites  had  reached  Jerusalem  and  had 
built  the  Temple,  which  was  of  great  length,  width,  and 
height,  the  priests  used  to  sing  these  Psalms  as  they 
ascended  the  steps  of  the  Temple  to  the  Holy  of  Holies, 
reciting  a  Psalm  at  each  step  until  they  reached  the 
highest  step.  For  this  reason  those  Psalms  were  vari- 
ously known  as  Steps,  Stations,  or  Ascents. 

As  for  us  Christians,  we  have  a  heavenly  Jerusalem 
to  which  we  are  about  to  ascend  from  the  land  of  our 
sojourn  on  this  earth,  according  to  our  Saviour's  prom- 
ise/ Following  the  Church  of  the  Old  Testament,  the 
Orthodox  Church  arranged  little  hymns  which  she 
called  Anabathmoi,  signifying  thereby  the  New  Jeru- 
salem to  which  we  shall  ascend  through  the  mercies  of 
our  Saviour  and  the  power  of  our  Hope.  And  as  the 
service  then  enters  a  new  stage  we  announce  this  by 
saying,  'Trokeimenon".^ 

Kontakion  and  Oikos 

In  order  that  the  Church  may  glorify  God  in  brief 
expressions  and  similarly  praise  his  saints,  God's  grace 
called  his  saint  Romanus,  Deacon  of  the  Church  of 
Beirut,  to  this  task.  It  is  related  that  this  saint,  who 
was  very  fond  of  monastic  life,  went  to  Constantinople 
and  stayed  in  the  Monastery  of  Cyrus,  dedicated  to  the 
Virgin  Mary.  So  great  was  his  piety  and  religious 
zeal  that  he  used  to  go  from  his  cell  to  the  Church  of 
the  Ever-virgin  in  Flashrines  and  spend  the  w^hole  night 
in  prayer.  This  he  did  especially  on  the  days  of  do- 
minical feasts,  persisting  in  singing  and  prayers  in  the 
church.  On  one  of  these  occasions,  on  the  night  of  the 
Nativity,  as  he  was  in  that  church,  he  was  overtaken  by 
fatigue  and  slept.  In  his  sleep  the  Virgin  Mary  ap- 
peared to  him  in  a  dream.  She  approached  him,  hold- 
ing in  her  hand  a  scroll,  and  said,  ''Open  your  mouth 
and  eat  this  grace  that  I  am  about  to  give  you."    The 

iSt.  Jn.   14:2-3.     2  See  p.  1063.

saint  opened  his  mouth  and  swallowed  the  scroll.  And 
when  he  awoke  and  realized  what  the  dream  meant  he 
went  up  into  the  pulpit,  as  one  who  had  been  carried 
away  by  ecstacy  to  the  seventh  heaven  from  the  effect 
of  the  dream,  and  began  to  chant  a  song  which  the 
Church  has  called  Kontakion,  meaning  abbreviation,  or 
the  abbreviated  song. 

So  surprised  were  the  people  at  the  sweet  voice  with 
which  the  saint  sang^  this  song  that  it  was  obvious  to 
them  that  what  they  were  hearing  was  nothing  less  than 
a  tune  given  to  him  as  a  gift  from  heaven.  And  be- 
cause of  the  sweetness  of  his  voice  he  was  called  Me- 
lodus  (or  Melodious).  St.  Romanus  was  thus  the  first 
to  compose  the  Kontakion,  beginning  with  the  Konta- 
kion  of  Christmas.  Subsequently  he  composed  the  rest 
of  the  Kontakions  for  the  dominical  feasts,  for  the  all- 
holy  Virgin,  and  for  all  the  saints,  altogether  over  a 
thousand  Kontakions,  many  of  which  the  Church  has 
adopted  in  her  services  all  the  year  round.  St.  Romanus 
died  in  the  year  510. 

The  Oikos  also,  like  the  Kontakion,  is  a  condensed 
form  of  hymn.  The  Greek  word  means  house,  signify- 
ing that  the  Oikos  contained  all  the  essentials  of  a  house- 
hold. Similarly  the  Oikos  of  the  church  service  com- 
prised in  brief  indications  of  the  saint  or  the  feast. 

Canon  and  Ode 

The  Canon,  as  used  in  the  church  service,  signifies 
several  hymns  which  are  divided  into  nine  divisions, 
symbolizing,  as  Zonares  said  in  his  commentary  on 
church  hymns,  the  nine  ranks  of  the  angels. 

These  divisions  are  called  Odes,  an  Ode  being  a  song 
of  praise,  taken  from  the  songs  of  praise  of  the  Prophets 
and  prophetesses  of  the  Old  Testament.  An  exception 
is  the  Ninth  Ode  which  is  taken  from  the  contents  of 
the  sayings  of  the  Theotokos  and  of  Zacharias  the  par- 
ent of  John  the  Forerunner. 


Appendices  1089 

Further,  the  Second  Ode  is  omitted  throughout  the 
year,  and  is  used  only  in  the  Great  Fast,  being  in  its 
contents  a  rebuke  of  the  Jewish  people  for  their  iniqui- 
ties. For  this  reason  it  is  sung  in  the  Great  Fast  to  warn 
sinners,  and  to  induce  them  to  reform  their  conduct  and 
purify  their  consciences. 


Katahasia  and  Hermos 

The  holy  Church  in  order  to  represent  the  descent  of 
the  Word  of  God,  his  Nativity,  and  his  Ascension,  com- 
posed songs  which  she  called  Katabasias,  meaning 
descent  or  songs  of  descension,  which  are  nine  in  num- 
ber corresponding  to  the  nine  principal  Odes. 

In  the  days  of  St.  Cosma,  the  great  composer  and 
singer  of  his  time,  while  sitting  in  his  usual  seat  in  the 
choir,  he  came  down  to  the  middle  of  the  church,  and 
in  his  angelic  voice  sang  a  song  which  he  had  composed 
on  the  Nativity  of  Christ,  ^'Christ  is  born,  glorify  him.; 
Christ  has  come  from  the  heavens,  receive  him;  Christ 
is  on  earth,  arise  ye."  And  when  he  came  to  the  last 
word  he  went  back  and  ascended  to  his  seat. 

In  this  way  the  saint  symbolized  the  descent  of  the 
Word  of  God  from  his  heaven,  by  his  own  descent  from 
his  seat  to  the  middle  of  the  church.  And  again  he 
symbolized  Christ's  ascent  by  his  own  ascent  to  his  seat 
in  the  choir,  as  he  said,  ''Arise  ye."  As  in  a  sermon  St. 
Cosma  taught  us  how  to  elevate  ourselves  spiritually 
from  things  earthly  and  to  receive  Christ  in  the  spirit 
whence  he  came. 

The  meaning  of  the  Katabasias  was  also  carried  out 
by  the  Church  when  the  Bishop  descended  from  his 
cell  to  the  church,  singing  the  first  Katabasia,  and  later 
as  he  ascends  his  throne  in  the  church.  If  however,  the 
Bishop  is  in  his  throne  before  he  sings  the  first  Kata- 
basia, he  descends  one  step  as  he  sings  it;  and  when  he 
says,  "Arise  ye",  he  goes  back  to  his  place.    The  singer, 


1090  Appendices 

too,  in  the  absence  of  the  Bishop,  descends  from  his 
seat  as  he  sings  the  first  Katabasia,  and  returns  to  it 
when  he  comes  to  the  end  of  the  song. 

The  Katabasias  being  poetical  compositions  set  to 
special  tunes,  are  also  called  Hermoses,  which  means 
key,  or  jveasure,  thus  called  because  they  represent  the 
keys  to  the  Odes  that  follow  them. 


Magnifications  and  Theotokion 

The  holy  Church  ordained  that  the  Ninth  Ode  should 
be  a  hymn  of  praise  to  the  Theotokos,  and  called  it 
Magnification  (Magnificat)  because  it  starts  with  the 
words,  ''My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord."  This  Ode 
is  sung  in  almost  all  the  canons.  The  Church  made 
this  Ode,  which  is  the  last  of  the  hymns,  also  the  last 
of  the  hymns  of  the  Old  Testament,  signifying  thereby 
the  Virgin's  unity  with  her  Son,  who  is  the  fulfillment 
of  the  law  and  the  Prophets;  for  since  the  Virgin  sang 
this  while  bearing  Christ,  it  is  meet  that  she  be  glori- 
fied and  magnified  at  the  same  time  with  her  Son  with 
these  Magnifications.  The  Church  also  ordained  that 
after  each  verse  of  the  Magnifications  the  hymn,  ''O 
thou  who  art  more  honourable/'  etc.,  be  sung,  referring 
to  the  immeasurable  glory  and  ineffable  station  which 
she  attained  by  the  unity  with  her  of  the  Word  of  God 
and  because  of  his  assumption  of  a  body  from  her  unde- 
filed  blood,  and  her  giving  of  birth  to  the  Salvation  of 
the  world. 

For  the  same  reason  and  purpose  the  Church  also 
arranged  hymns  which  she  called  Theotokions,  mean- 
ing songs  to  the  Theotokos,  which  always  follow  the 
hymns  addressed  to  her  Son.  The  Theotokions  thus 
signify  the  unity  of  the  Theotokos  with  Christ  through 
her  motherhood,  and  his  unity  with  her  through  his 
sonship. 


Appendices  1091 

Akathiston 
The   Greek  word   means   not  permitted  to  sit,   and 
is  applied  to  a  paean  for  the  Theotokos  in  which  the 
congregation  is  not  permitted  to  sit/ 

Paracletice 

Or  Paracletike,  pertaining  to  Paraclesis.  This  latter 
word  has  two  distinct  meanings,  the  first  is  consolation, 
from  which  the  Holy  Spirit  was  called  Paraclete,  or 
Consoler,  and  the  second  is  Supplication,  or  Petition. 
From  the  latter  meaning  we  derive  the  two  canons  the 
Great  and  the  Little  Paracletice,  which  are  supplica- 
tory hymns  to  the  Theotokos." 

Oktoechos 

A  Greek  word  meaning  eight  tones,  which  idiomati- 
cally began  to  be  applied  to  the  collection  of  hymnal 
canons  composed  by  St.  John  of  Damascus. 

Photagogikon — Exaposteilarion  and  Hypakoe 

Having  reached  in  our  Matin  service  the  time  of  the 
dawn  when  the  sun  is  about  to  appear,  we  chant  a  hymn 
which  is  called  Photagogikon,  which  means  illumina- 
tor, because  we  recite  it  always  after  the  canon  and  at 
the  appearance  of  the  light  of  day.  And  in  this  hymn 
we  petition  God  to  send  us  his  divine  light  for  the  illu- 
mination of  our  minds  and  the  sanctification  of  our 
souls. 

On  Sundays  and  feast  days,  however,  we  sing  instead 
of  it  the  Exaposteilarion,  which  means  dispatching,  and 
refers  to  the  dispatching  by  Christ  after  his  Resurrec- 
tion of  the  ointment-bearing  women,  and  to  the  dis- 
patching of  the  Disciples  to  preach  to  the  world  and 
to  warn  it.  The  Exaposteilarion  is  the  composition  of 
King  Constantine  the  Porphrogint  (born  in  Porphry) 
who  reigned  in  the  year  912  and  died  in  959, 

1  See  Fifth  Week  of  the  Fast.     2  p.   32, 


1092  Appendices 

But  Emperor  Leo  the  Wise,  who  preceded  the  above- 
mentioned  Constantine  and  who  reigned  in  886  and 
died  in  912,  having  observed  behind  the  physical  phe- 
nomenon of  the  rise  of  the  sun  its  spiritual  significance 
— the  obedience  of  the  women  in  the  mission  on  which 
Christ  had  sent  them — composed  a  song  which  he  called 
Hypakoe,  meaning  obedience;  for  in  it  there  is  refer- 
ence to  the  obedience  shown  by  the  ointment-bearing 
women,  and  more  especially  to  the  Theorokos,  who  is 
the  second  Eve,  as  they  were  going  to  the  tomb  of  the 
Life-giver,  who  is  the  second  Adam.  And  having  be- 
held him  in  the  garden,  the  women  submitted  in  obedi- 
ence to  him,  in  expiation  of  the  disobedience  of  our 
first  forefathers. 

For  in  that  P^ve  disobeyed  God's  commandment  and 
because  of  her  we  were  expelled  from  paradise,  so  those 
women,  and  particularly  the  Theotokos,  when  they  be- 
held Christ  and  offered  him  their  obedience,  received 
joy  in  place  of  that  first  sorrow. 

Etnos,  Eothina,  and  the  Doxology 

Noble  souls  which  are  accustomed  to  virtue  and  right- 
eousness are  not  content  to  discharge  their  mere  duty 
of  confession  of  the  Godhead,  nor  that  of  praise  and 
thanksgiving  to  God  for  the  abundance  of  his  benevo- 
lences. Rather,  because  of  their  intense  love,  their 
warmth  of  faith,  and  their  zeal  to  universalize  the 
divine  worship,  they  ask  the  greater  good  and  the  more 
persuasive  beneficence.  They  pray  for  all  people  and 
call  the  whole  of  creation  to  join  them  in  offering  their 
veneration  to  God  their  Creator,  as  the  three  youths 
did  while  in  the  midst  of  the  flaming  fire,  and  as  David 
also  did.^ 

In  accordance  with  this  spirit  of  piety  and  this  zeal, 
the  holy  Church  instituted  a  hymn  which  she  called 
Einos  {or  Praise)^  and  in  which  she  called  upon  every 
soul  and  every  creature  to  join  her  in  offering  praises 

1  Dan.   3:52-90;  Ps.   102:22;  and  Ps.   148. 


Appendices  109.^ 

and  thanksgiving  to  God  for  his  acts  of  mercy  and  love 
to  mankind,  which  were  especially  revealed  at  the  ap- 
pearance of  the  Saviour  on  earth,  the  true  Light  of  the 
world.  For  this  reason,  as  we  sing  the  hymns  assigned 
for  such  praises  we  chant  or  recite  the  glorification  with 
which  the  angels  glorified  God  who  was  incarnate  for 
the  salvation  of  the  world.  By  this  we  mean  the  Dox- 
ology  which  is  the  Great  Glorification,  ''Glory  be  to 
thee,  O  thou  who  hast  revealed  the  light",  etc. 

On  Sundays  the  Church  has  assigned  to  this  Glorifi- 
cation or  Great  Doxology  the  reading  of  Gospels,  which 
are  known  as  Eothina  and  mean  pertaining  to  the  dawn. 
They  are  eleven  in  number,  symbolizing  the  eleven  ap- 
pearances of  the  Saviour  to  hisDisciples  after  his  Resur- 
rection from  the  dead.  These  appearances  were  a  con- 
firmation to  his  Disciples  of  his  Resurrection,  as  well  as 
for  the  purpose  of  compassion  on  his  followers,  that  they 
be  not  overcome  by  sorrow  over  a  long  period.  Especial- 
ly was  this  true  of  hisMother  the  Virgin  Mary,  to  whom 
he  appeared  first  (and  who  is  referred  to  cryptically  as 
the  "other  Mary,  the  Mother  of  James"). ^  The  second 
appearance  was  to  Mary  Magdalene  alone  at  the  tomb, 
the  third  to  the  same  Mary  and  her  companions  on  the 
way  to  Jerusalem,  the  fourth  was  to  Peter,  the  fifth  to 
the  two  Disciples  Luke  and  Cleopas  who  were  going 
to  Emmaus,  the  sixth  to  all  the  Apostles,  excepting 
Thomas,  the  seventh  to  the  eleven  Disciples,  the  eighth 
to  seven  of  the  Apostles  who  were  at  the  shore  of  the 
lake  of  Tiberias,  the  ninth  to  more  than  five  hundred 
brethren  on  a  mountain,  the  tenth  to  James,  and  the 
eleventh  to  all  his  Apostles  on  the  day  of  his  Ascension." 

To  the  same  end  the  Church  ordained  special  hymns 
commemorating  these  holy  appearances  and  called  them 
Doxas  of  the  Eothina,  containing  each  the  meaning  of 
one  of  those  appearances  for  that  particular  Sunday.

These  Doxas  of  the  Eothina  were  also  the  composition 
of  Emperor  Leo  the  Wise,  the  author  of  the  Hypakoe. 
After  singing  the  Doxas  of  the  Eothina;  if  it  be  a 
Sunday,  or  the  Doxa  of  the  Einos,  if  it  be  a  great  feast 
day,  we  sing  the  Troparion  assigned  for  that  day  and 
begin  the  service  of  the  Divine  Liturgy.  Otherwise  we 
recite  the  petitions  beginning  with,  "Let  us  finish  our 
morning  petitions  to  the  Lord",  and  those  that  follow 
it.  Then  we  recite  the  Stichera  of  the  Oktoechos, 
known  as  the  Aposticha,  with  its  Stichoi.  Then  we  say, 
''It  is  a  good  thing  to  confess  to  the  Lord" ;  "Holy  God", 
and  what  follows  it,  and  the  Troparion  of  the  day.  Then 
we  recite  the  supplicatory  petitions  which  are  known 
as  Ektene,  "Have  mercy  upon  us,  O  God,  according  to 
the  multitude  of  thy  mercies."  Then  we  pray  God  to 
uphold  our  kings,  and  we  conclude  the  service,  and  be- 
gin at  once  with  the  service  of  the  First  Hour. 

The  First  Hour 

God  sent  his  Son  a  Light,  a  Guidance,  and  a  Salva- 
tion to  the  world.  However,  while  God  expected  con- 
fession of  faith  for  his  supernatural  miracles,  and  faith 
in  his  sublime  teachings,  leading  like  a  guiding  light 
to  the  truth,  in  acordance  with  the  utterance  of  the 
prophecies,  the  same  prophecies  which  were  entrusted 
to  those  for  whose  salvation  he  had  especially  come,  be- 
hold, instead  of  faith  they  made  him  taste  the  most 
severe  sufferings  and  the  most  bitter  pains.  They  de- 
livered him  into  the  hands  of  oppressive  judges,  who, 
even  in  spite  of  all  the  lying,  deceit,  and  false  accusa- 
tions of  those  who  delivered  him,  found  nothing  in  him 
to  merit  conviction. 

In  order  that  the  holy  Church  may  point  to  her  chil- 
dren and  remind  them  of  the  state  of  those  cruel  men, 
and  of  what  happened  to  our  Lord  God  and  Saviour 
Jesus  Christ  in  that  hour,  as  he  was  in  the  midst  of 
his  struggles  for  salvation,  she  instituted  the  Prayer  of 
the  First  Hour.     In  this  service  is  unfolded  the  deceit. 


Appendices  1095 

cruelty,  and  vileness  of  the  Jewish  high  priests  and 
their  elders  in  their  accusations  against  Christ.  It  also 
reveals  Christ's  guilelessness,  his  truthfulness,  upright- 
ness, and  virtue,  set  against  their  iniquities,  inventions, 
and  envy,  as  the  fifth  Psalm  referring  to  them,  makes 
plain,  and  also  the  one  hundredth  Psalm,  the  second, 
third,  and  sixth  verses  of  the  same  service. 

Likew^ise,  the  holy  Church  intended  in  this  prayer 
of  the  First  Hour  to  urge  her  children  to  seek  heavenly 
blessings  and  divine  aid  in  order  to  facilitate  their  daily 
tasks  and  the  labour  of  their  hands,  in  accordance  w^ith 
the  words  of  the  Prophet,  "Man  goeth  forth  unto  his 
work  and  to  his  labour  until  the  evening.  O  Jehovah, 
how  manifold  are  thy  works!  In  wisdom  hast  thou 
made  them  all."^ 

The  same  may  be  gathered  from  the  contents  of  Ps. 
89:14,  etc.  This  service  was  added  with  the  Midnight 
Prayer  in  the  fourth  century  to  the  collection  of  serv- 
ices that  were  in  use  in  the  first  century. 


The  Third  and  Sixth  Hours 

Because  of  two  events  which  took  place  in  the  third 
hour,  the  Church  instituted  the  service  of  the  Third 
Hour  in  commemoration  of  them.  The  first  of  these 
was  the  sentence  of  death  passed  by  Pilate  against  our 
Lord  God  Jesus  Christ.  The  second  was  the  descent  of 
the  Holy  Spirit  upon  the  Disciples  in  the  upper  room 
of  Zion.^  And  since  this  service  falls  in  the  early  part 
of  the  morning,  the  Priest  opens  with,  "Blessed  be  God 
our  God",  and  what  follows  it.  As  for  the  service  of 
the  Sixth  Hour,  it  was  instituted  by  the  Church  in  mem- 
ory of  sufferings  and  the  Passion  endured  by  our  Re- 
deemer when  he  was  suspended  on  the  Cross.

and  the  Troparion  and  the  Prayer. 


1096  Appendices 

Typica:  Antiphony  and  Makarizmoi 

The  Prophets  foretold  all  the  events  of  the  coming 
of  the  Saviour,  from  the  time  of  his  Birth  to  his  Ascen- 
sion into  heaven.  They  left  out  nothing  of  the  sayings 
and  doings  of  Christ,  but  they  prophesied  thereof,  in- 
cluding those  that  took  place  up  to  the  time  of  John  the 
Baptist,  when  Christ  had  not  yet  fulfilled  his  offering 
of  himself  as  a  Sacrifice,  nor  given  the  form  of  his  body 
as  an  oblation  in  the  form  of  bread  and  wine,  as  the 
Holy  Bible  had  symbolized  that  by  the  offering  of  Mel- 
chizedek,  the  manna  of  the  Israelites,  the  lamb  of  the 
Passover,  and  other  symbols  that  refer  to  it. 

Up  to  the  time  of  John  the  Baptist,  therefore,  the 
prophecies  followed  the  course  of  the  events  in  the  life 
of  Christ  and  his  doings.  And  among  the  works  of 
salvation  was  the  offering  of  Christ  himself  as  a  Sacri- 
fice, by  giving  his  body,  in  the  form  of  bread  and  wine, 
as  an  oblation. 

In  order  to  allude  to  the  sayings  of  the  Prophets  with 
which  they  prophesied  of  the  times  up  to  John  the  Bap- 
tist, in  which  Christ  was  present  but  not  appearing  to 
many  nor  known  by  many  as  the  Saviour  and  Redeem- 
er, the  Church  instituted  a  service  which  consisted  of 
Psalms  and  hymns,  and  which  she  called  Typica,  mean- 
ing typical  or  symbolical.  And  in  this  service  the 
Church  points  out  and  explains  the  events  of  the  time 
of  John  the  Baptist,  in  which  the  holy  oblations  were 
present  yet  hidden  in  the  Person  of  Christ.  As  Vilaras 
said,  ''The  Typica  is  a  symbol  of  the  warnings  of  the 
forefathers  and  Prophets."  A  similar  interpretation 
is  given  by  St.  Germanus,  and  also  by  Kavasella,  where 
he  says  in  the  eighteenth  chapter  of  his  work,  ''The  say- 
ings of  the  Prophets  which  are  sung  refer  to  the  time  of 
John  the  Baptist." 

The  Typica  applies  to  those  prophecies,  whether  they 
consist  of  whole  Psalms  or  of  verses,  or  whether  they 
are  taken  from  verses  of  the  Psalms,  which  are  called 
in  the  rite  of  the  service  Stichoi;  for  they  all  come  from 


Appendices  1097 

the  Old  Testament.  And  since  the  Typica  is  sung  by 
both  choirs  alternately,  it  is  also  called  Antiphony, 
which  means  singing  or  chanting  alternately.  The  An- 
tiphony also  is  applied  to  whatever  is  sung  alternately 
by  the  two  choirs. 

The  first  to  institute  the  Typica,  according  to  the 
authority  of  Photius  the  Patriarch  of  Constantinople, 
was  the  God-mantled  Ignatius,  the  Bishop  of  Antioch, 
who  was  raised  by  the  Apostle  St.  Peter  and  who  was 
also  a  disciple  of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  and  one  of 
the  children  who  were  brought  to  Christ  to  be  blessed. 
But  Philemon  the  Hebrew  mentions  in  his  history  that 
the  Antiphony  was  sung  in  his  day  in  Alexandria  be- 
fore it  was  introduced  by  St.  Ignatius  in  Antioch. 

The  Typica,  or  Antiphony,  is  divided  into  three  sta- 
tions, symbolizing  three  stages  of  the  history  of  Israel, 
namely  from  Abraham  to  David,  from  David  to  the 
Babylonian  Captivity,  and  from  the  Babylonian  Cap- 
tivity to  Christ.  It  is  usually  performed  after  the  serv- 
ice of  the  Sixth  Hour.  Later  on  there  was  added  to 
this  service  the  Makarizmoi  or  Beatitudes,  consisting 
of  verses  from  the  Gospels,  each  of  which  begins  with 
the  word  blessed,  and  of  Troparia  and  of  chanting,  ^'O 
only-begotten,  Son  and  Word  of  God",  etc.,  alluding  to 
the  fact  that  the  Son  of  God  whom  the  Prophets  fore- 
told is  the  same  who  from  the  beginning  of  time  was 
begotten  of  the  Father,  but  who  in  time  was  born  of  the 
Virgin  as  Jesus,  God  and  Man  in  one.  He  is  one  of 
the  Holy  Trinity,  glorified  with  the  Father  and  with 
the  Holy  Spirit,  as  Simeon  the  Thessalonian  declares, 
''By  these  Psalms  the  Incarnation  of  the  Son  of  God  was 
foretold;  but  by  the  hymns  the  fullness  of  his  grace  is 
made  manifest." 

And  in  order  that  the  Church  may  not  deny  the  faith- 
ful a  service  which  symbolizes  in  this  fashion  the  fore- 
warnings  and  prophecies  of  the  Old  Testament,  and 
which  alludes  to  the  holy  oblations  hidden  inChristeven 
before  he  instituted  them,  the  Church  ordained  that  the 


1098  Appendices 

Typica  may  be  substituted  for  the  service  of  the  Holy 
Mass  on  days  when  the  Mass  is  not  served,  either  be- 
cause of  the  absence  of  a  Priest,  or  because  he  may  not 
be  prepared,  or  for  some  other  reason.  For  this  reason 
the  Church  took  from  the  Mass  of  the  Catechumens  the 
one  hundred  and  second  Psalm,  ''Bless  the  Lord,  O  my 
soul",  etc.,  which  constitutes  the  First  Antiphony,  and 
the  one  hundred  and  forty-fifth  Psalm,  "Praise  the 
Lord,  O  my  soul",  etc.,  and  the  Hymn,  "O  only-begot- 
ten Son  and  Word  of  God",  etc.,  both  of  which  consti- 
tute the  Second  Antiphony.  These  are  followed  by  the 
Makarizimoi,  or  Beatitudes,^  with  the  words  of  the 
penitent  thief,  "Remember  us.  Lord,  when  thou  comest 
into  thy  kingdom,"  ^  following  each  Beatitude.  To  this 
service  of  the  Typica,  which  is  taken  from  the  Mass  of 
the  Catechumens,  the  Church  added  something  taken 
from  the  Mass  of  the  Faithful,  namely  the  Creed,  "I 
believe  in  One  God",  etc.,  with  the  Prayer  beginning, 
"Pardon,  forego,  and  forgive,  O  God",  etc.,  the  Lord's 
Prayer,  "Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven",  etc.,  the  Kon- 
takion  of  the  day  or  of  the  feast  on  which  the  service 
falls,  and  the  thirty-third  Psalm,  "I  will  bless  the  Lord 
at  all  times",  etc.

THE  DIVINE  LITURGY  AND  THE  OBJECT 
OF  ITS  INSTITUTION 

All  beings  created  by  God  achieve  the  goodness  and 
benevolence  of  their  Creator  in  so  far  as  they  are 
brought  from  naught  into  being,  and  in  so  far  as  God 
guides  and  preserves  them;  for  the  whole  creation  is 
God's  possession  and  he  is  the  Cause  of  its  being.  Yet 
the  whole  does  not  achieve  this  equally  or  in  the  same 
degree,  but  each  according  to  his  station  received  of  the 
good  gifts  of  God. 

iSt.  Matt.  5:3-13.      2  St.  Luke  23:42. 


Appendices  1099 

Thus  inanimate  beings  attain  existence  and  the  beauty 
thereof,  and  animals  enjoy  existence  and  the  possession 
of  life.  But  man  was  distinguished  above  all  these  in 
that  he  was  created  according  to  the  form  and  likeness 
of  God,  and  in  that  this  sensible  creation  was  created 
for  his  sake.  God,  therefore,  created  man  because  he 
loved  him,  and  that  he  might  enjoy  God's  love  in  more 
abundance,  in  so  far  as  God  singled  him  out  immeas- 
urably above  all  other  creatures.  Furthermore  it  was 
vouchsafed  man,  by  his  free  choice,  to  unite  with  God. 

But  since  man  shared  the  likeness  of  God  but  did  not 
preserve  it,  he  fell  under  death  and  corruption  because 
of  his  disobedience ;  and  having  lost  the  first  birth  which 
was  free  of  suffering  and  consequence,  he  also  lost  the 
beauty  that  was  first  his,  the  splendour,  the  joy,  the 
everlasting  life,  and  the  eternal  bliss  which  were  his 
through  his  union  with  God.  The  Creator,  because  of 
the  abundance  of  his  mercies  and  love,  became  like  unto 
us  and  united  with  our  weak  and  humble  nature.  He 
took  unto  himself  a  body  from  the  ever-virgin  Mary, 
and  by  his  Birth,  Baptism,  Passion,  and  Resurrection 
he  delivered  our  nature  from  the  sin  of  our  forefathers, 
restoring  unto  us  what  we  had  lost  of  everlasting  life, 
which  consists  of  beholding  God  and  enjoying  him  for 
ever. 

The  flesh  which  the  Word  of  God  took  unto  himself 
from  our  human  nature  alone  was  sanctified  because  of 
its  union  with  God,  and  he  alone  was  filled  with  the 
divine  gifts  and  in  him  alone  dwelt  the  fullness  of  the 
Godhead,  as  it  is  written  in  the  Holy  Scriptures.^  In 
order,  therefore,  that  this  sanctification  and  enjoyment 
of  the  divine  gifts  may  not  be  limited  to  the  First-born 
of  our  nature  (the  humanity  which  the  Word  took  unto 
himself),  but  may  pervade  all  those  who  desire  this 
communion  and  this  attainment  through  the  second 
birth,  free  of  the  effects  of  passion,  and  through  which 
we  become  the  children  of  God,  born  unto  everlasting

life,  God  gave  us  a  noble,  holy,  and  undefiled  birth, 
which  is  Baptism. 

And  because  we  are  of  dual  nature,  composed  of 
spirit  and  flesh.  Baptism  also  becomes  dual,  consisting 
of  a  material  element  and  of  a  spiritual,  divine  power. 

And  since  this  birth  is  spiritual  and  supernatural,  we 
demand  a  food  which  is  also  spiritual  and  supernatural, 
suitable  for  our  birth  which  gives  us  everlasting  life. 
This  food  is  the  invisible  Body  and  Blood  of  our  Lord 
in  visible  forms,  which  are  the  forms  of  bread  and  wine. 
By  that  birth,  therefore,  and  by  that  food  the  natural 
Son  of  God  made  us  children  of  God  by  adoption.  He 
gave  us  himself  as  a  symbol  and  example  in  all  these 
things  that  we  may  follow  his  example  and  win  the 
eternal  gifts — life  everlasting  and  endless  bliss — which 
we  had  lost  and  which  he  restored  to  us. 

This  is  the  object  of  his  Incarnation  and  of  his  Birth, 
of  his  granting  unto  us  his  holy  Body  as  food,  that  he 
may  make  us  through  his  Incarnation  his  chosen  ones, 
through  his  Birth  his  companions,  and  through  our 
nourishment  by  him  inheritors  of  his  kingdom. 

He  commanded  us  the  living  to  be  steadfast  in  our 
performance  of  this  in  remembrance  of  him,^  and  in 
remembrance  of  his  benevolence  to  us  until  he  comes 
again  to  judge  the  world.  This  is  accomplished  through 
faith  by  inheritance  and  by  transmission  from  the  liv- 
ing destined  to  die,  to  the  dead  who  shall  live  again  by 
regeneration,  that  salvation  may  extend  unto  all  men.^ 

First  Bishop  over  the  First  of  the  Churches  of  Christ 

In  view  of  what  has  been  said  above  the  Church  in-

of  the  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist,  or  the  Lord's  Sup-

from  his  Birth  of  his  virgin  Mother  to  his  Ascension 
into  heaven. 

This  service  of  the  Divine  Mass,  in  its  present  ar- 
rangement, was  transmitted  to  the  Catholic  Orthodox 
Church  by  St.  James  the  Apostle,  w^ho  was  the  first 
Bishop  consecrated  by  Christ  before  his  Ascension,  to 
the  throne  of  the  church  of  holy  Jerusalem,  God's 
dwelling-place  and  throne,  and  the  mother  of  all  the 
churches  of  the  world, ^  where  Christ  was  born,  where 
he  came  together  with  his  Disciples,  performed  the 
sacramental  Supper,  and  where  the  Holy  Spirit  de- 
scended on  the  Day  of  Pentecost.^  The  church  of 
Jerusalem  was  followed  by  that  of  Antioch,  the  first  seat 
of  St.  Peter.  This  same  church  was  the  house  of  Theo- 
philus,  which  he  endowed  as  a  church  after  embracing 
the  faith  in  Christ.'^  And  it  was  Christ  himself  who 
taught  his  brother  James  the  service  of  the  Mass,  hav- 
ing first  appeared  to  him  and  later  to  him  and  the  rest 
of  the  Apostles.'* 

First  Appearance  of  the  Divine  Liturgy 

The  service  of  the  Divine  Mass  before  it  was  estab- 
lished by  the  Apostle  James  was  very  simple,  as  we  may 
gather  from  the  Acts  and  the  Epistles  of  the  Apostles; 
for  after  Christ  had  ascended  to  heaven  the  Disciples 
used  to  come  together  with  the  rest  of  the  faithful,  and 
meet  in  one  of  the  houses  of  Jerusalem,  particularly  the 
upper  room  of  Zion.'    After  lighting  the  lamps/'  one

as  he  tells  us  in  the  seventh  book  of  his  History,  chapter  fifteen,*  where  he 
says,  "When  the  faithful  fled  from  Jerusalem  at  the  time  it  was  besieged  by 
Titus  they  took  with  them  the  episcopal  throne  of  St.  James.

James)  was  the  first  to  receive  the  Cathedra  of  a  bishopric,  and  the  first  to

of  the  Apostles  would  stand  up  and  preach,  teaching 
those  present/  Then  all  would  stand  up,  and  one  of 
them  coming  forward  offers  prayers  and  supplications 
to  God  with  groanings  which  cannot  be  uttered,  as  the 
Holy  Spirit  would  inspire  him.^  When  he  finishes  the 
prayer  the  elder  among  them  takes  bread  and  wine 
mixed  with  hot  water  and  blesses  them,  calling  the  Holy 
Spirit  to  change  them  into  the  undefiled  Body  and  pre- 
cious Blood  of  Christ.^  After  that  he  breaks  the  bread 
that  has  become  transformed  into  the  Lord's  Body,  and 
having  first  partaken  of  it  and  of  the  cup,  he  passes  them 
to  all  those  who  are  present.^  At  the  conclusion  of  this 
Communion  they  offered  prayers  of  thanksgiving  to 
God.    This  constitutes  the  prayer  of  the  Metalepsis. 

Metalepsis 
The  word  in  Greek  means  Communion,  and  refers  to 
the  divine  communion  or  the  prayer  of  preparation  for 
receiving  the  Communion  and  the  prayer  of  thanksgiv- 
ing which  follows  the  Communion,  as  was  the  custom 
of  the  Jews;  for  those  latter  used  to  recite  or  sing,  after 
consuming  the  Passover,  the  Psalms  from  112  to  118, 
as  is  evident  from  the  Holy  Gospel,  where  it  is  said  that 
the  Disciples,  having  eaten  the  Supper,  "sung  a  hymn", 
indicating  the  necessity  of  offering  thanksgivings  for 
having  partaken  of  the  holy  Body  and  Blood  of  Christ. 
Accordingly  the  holy  Church,  in  giving  thanks  to 
Christ  for  his  benefactions  and  benevolences  ordained 
special  prayers  for  the  communicants,  and  also  the  read- 
ing, for  all,  of  the  thirty-third  Psalm,  "I  will  bless  the 
Lord  at  all  times:  his  praise  shall  continually  be  in  my 
mouth."

the  Sacrament  of  his  holy  Body  on  the  eve  of  his  de- 
liverance, and  how  the  w^orthy  and  the  unv^orthy  (like 
Judas)  received  this  Sacrament.  Hence  we  say  in  this 
hymn,  ''Receive  me  today,  O  Son  of  God,  a  partaker  of 
the  sacramental  Supper",  etc. 

The  Church  kept  the  service  of  the  Divine  Liturgy 
in  its  entirety  as  she  received  it  from  the  undefiled  Apos- 
tles/ But  in  time  and  in  conformity  vs^ith  changing  con- 
ditions, the  Church,  through  the  inspiration  of  the  Holy 
Spirit, introduced  certain  regulations  and  improvements 
which  are  useful  for  the  upbuilding  of  the  faithful,  as- 
signing readings  from  the  Holy  Scriptures,  and  pray- 
ers, as  we  said  before. 

The  Service  of  the  Liturgy  after  the  Saints,  James 
Basil,  John,  and  Gregory 

The  Liturgy  of  St.  James  the  Apostle  is  used  not  only 
by  the  Orthodox  Church  but  also  by  churches  which 
are  foreign  to  its  doctrines,  such  as  the  Nestorian,  the 
Eutychian,  the  Armenian,  the  Syriac,  and  the  Jacobite. 
This  universal  compliance  in  all  the  ancient  services  of 
the  Mass,  in  the  most  significant  part  of  the  Eucharist, 
testifies  beyond  doubt  that  this  apostolic  act  and  its  de- 
livery were  as  instituted  on  this  particular  subject. 
It  also  testifies  that  the  belief  of  the  Catholic  Church 
of  Christ  is  the  same,  and  that  it  has  not  changed  from 
ancient  times  to  the  present.  And  because  of  the  diffi- 
culty of  communication  among  Christians  in  the  first 
three  centuries,  the  order  of  the  Divine  Liturgy  was  not 
the  same  in  all  the  churches.  For  instance,  the  Chris- 
tians in  Jerusalem  and  the  rest  of  Palestine  followed 
the  Liturgy  of  the  Apostle  James,  Bishop  of  Jerusalem; 
in  Alexandria  and  the  rest  of  Egypt  they  followed 
the  Liturgy  attributed  to  the  Evangelist  Mark,  Bishop 
of  Alexandria;  while  in  Rome  and  all  parts  of  the  west 
they  followed  the  Liturgy  attributed  to  St.  Clement  of 
Rome,  and  so  on.

1104  Appendices 

And  due  to  the  lengthy  petitions  in  the  service  of  St. 
James,  which  lasts  for  about  five  hours,  and  for  fear 
that  the  congregation  might  grov^  weary  and  listless  and 
unable  to  stand  throughout  all  that  time,  the  holy  Fath- 
ers thought  it  wise  to  abbreviate  or  condense  the  lengthy 
petitions  and  prayers  in  that  service,  retaining  passages 
appropriate  and  germane  to  the  service.  The  first  to 
do  this,  and  to  arrange  a  short  service  taken  from  St. 
James  the  Apostle  was  St.  Basil  the  Great,  whose  serv- 
ice is  known  after  his  name  as  the  Liturgy  of  St.  Basil. 
In  the  same  manner,  St.  John  Chrysostom  arranged  a 
service  from  St.  James  the  Apostle,  and,  this  also 
became  known  as  the  Liturgy  of  St.  John  Chry- 
sostom. Neither  of  these  Fathers  was  content  merely 
to  omit  parts  of  the  Liturgy  of  St.  James  but  they 
added  certain  prayers  and  petitions  known  by  their 
names.  The  use  of  these  two  Liturgies  spread  through- 
out the  east  and  west,  along  with  a  third  Liturgy  which 
was  used  in  the  days  of  the  Great  Fast  (Lent),  and 
which  was  known  as  the  Liturgy  of  Presanctified  Gifts. 
This  latter  was  known  in  the  east  from  the  days  of  the 
undefiled  Apostles  by  way  of  oral  transmission.  Then 
came  St.  Gregory,  Bishop  of  Rome,  known  as  Gregory 
Dialogus,  who  wrote  down  and  introduced  this  Liturgy 
in  the  west  in  the  sixth  century,  and  it  was  attributed  to 
him. 

Assigning  the  Time  of  the  Liturgical  Services, 
and  Their  Origin 

In  order  that  the  Church  may  preserve  the  unity  of 
faith  and  divine  worship  in  every  place,  she  ordained 
that  the  foregoing  Masses  be  celebrated  at  set  times,  as 
follows:  The  Mass  of  the  Apostle  James  is  celebrated 
on  the  day  of  his  feast,  on  the  twenty-third  of  October, 
and  may  be  celebrated  at  other  times,  as  the  elder 
wishes.  The  Mass  of  St.  Basil  is  celebrated  ten  times 
during  the  year  (which  see  in  his  service).  As  for  the 
Mass  of  St.  John  Chrysostom,  it  is  celebrated  through- 


Appendices  1105 

out  the  year  except  on  Wednesdays  and  Fridays  of  Holy 
Lent  and  on  Monday,  Tuesday,  and  Wednesday  of  Pas- 
sion Week.  The  Mass  of  St.  Gregory  is  celebrated  on 
the  days  of  Lent,  and  it  is  called  the  Proegiasmena,  or 
the  Presanctified  Mass,  because  the  gifts  or  oblations 
used  therein  may  not  be  transubstantiated  again,  having 
already  been  consecrated  in  a  previous  Mass.  How- 
ever, the  commemoration  of  the  faithful  is  fulfilled  in 
this  Mass,  as  mentioned  in  the  service. 

The  first  of  these  Masses,  as  we  said  before,  is  that  of 
St.  James  which  had  its  origin  in  the  first  century.  Then 
followed  the  Mass  of  St.  Basil  in  the  fourth  century; 
then  that  of  St.  John  Chrysostom  in  the  fifth  century, 
and  lastly  the  Gregorian  Mass  in  the  sixth  century. 
There  is  no  difference  in  the  essence  of  these  four  rites. 

Divisions  of  the  Mass 

The  service  of  the  Divine  Mass  is  divided  into  three 
parts:  the  first  part  is  the  Ofifering,  in  which  the  obla- 
tions (gifts)  of  bread  and  wine  are  brought  to  the  Altar 
(Table)  of  the  sanctuary  to  be  consecrated  by  the  Priest. 
The  second  part  is  the  Mass  of  the  Catechumens,  in 
which  of  old  the  Catechumens  were  allowed  to  be  pres- 
ent along  with  the  faithful.  The  catechumens  consist- 
ed of  heathen  who  were  preparing  themselves  to  enter 
the  Christian  religion  through  Baptism,  and  Christian 
penitents  who  had  fallen  from  membership  in  the 
Church  for  one  reason  or  another,  especially  those  who 
had  denied  Christ  and  were  returning  to  the  Faith.  The 
third  part  is  called  the  Mass  of  the  Faithful,  which  the 
faithful  only  are  permitted  to  attend.  Hence,  in  an- 
cient times,  at  the  beginning  of  this  part  the  catechu- 
mens and  the  penitents  would  leave  the  church. 

These  three  parts  which  constitute  the  holy  service  of 
Mass  are  securely  united  in  such  a  way  that  it  is  not 
possible  to  separate  them  one  from  another;  for  in  the 
first  part  the  matter  of  the  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist 
is  made  ready;  in  the  second  part  preparation  is  made 


1106 


Appendices 


for  the  celebration  of  the  Eucharist,  and  in  the  third, 
which  is  the  most  important,  the  Sacrament  of  the 
divine  Eucharist  is  fulfilled,  in  that  the  bread  and  wine 
are  transformed  into  the  precious  Body  and  undefiled 
Blood  of  Christ. 

The  first  part  of  the  divine  service  of  the  Mass  is 
named  from  the  fact  that  the  faithful  offer  the  bread 
and  wine  to  the  Priest  to  offer  the  bloodless  Sacrifice, 
and  for  this  reason  the  naming  of  this  part  as  the  Sacri- 
fice prevailed  among  almost  all  Orthodox  Christians. 

The  matter  of  the  Sacraments  of  the  Eucharist,  which 
is  thus  prepared  by  the  Priest,  consists  of  bread  and 
wine,  as  we  said  before.  The  first  of  these  must  come 
from  clean  wheat  and  must  be  leavened;  the  second 
from  the  pure  juice  of  the  vine  of  the  color  of  blood, 
following  the  example  of  our  Saviour  Jesus  Christ  who 
delivered  the  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist  under  the 
forms  of  these  two  substances.^ 

The  bread  of  the  oblation,  as  is  well  known,  should 
be  in  the  form  of  a  loaf,  round,  flattened,  and  thick.  It 
is  called  an  oblation  because  of  its  being  offered  for  the 
bloodless  Sacrifice.  On  the  upper  side  of  this  oblation, 
exactly  in  the  middle,  is  impressed  the  sign  of  the  cross, 
surrounded  by  the  Greek  letters  I^  (which  means 
Jesus),  XC  (Christ)  and  the  word  N  I  K  A  (con- 
quer) as  in  the  following  diagram: 


Thus  the  whole  sentence  would  read,  ''In  the  sign  of 
the  Cross  of  Jesus  Christ  thou  shalt  conquer,"  which  is

taken,  as  is  well  known,  from  the  wonderful  miracle 
which  appeared  in  the  middle  of  the  skies  to  the  great 
king  Constantine  before  he  embraced  Christianity.^ 

In  old  times  it  was  customary  for  Christians  to  ofifer 
for  the  divine  Mass  several  pieces  of  bread,  from  which 
the  Priest  would  choose  the  best  for  the  celebration  of 
the  Sacrament.  The  rest  then  would  be  distributed  to 
the  poor  and  needy.  But  now  it  is  considered  sufficient 
to  offer  five  pieces,  commemorating  the  five  loaves  with 
which  the  Lord  satisfied  five  thousand  souls. ^  From 
these  five  the  Priest  selects  one  for  the  fulfillment  of 
the  Eucharist,  or  for  the  Sacrifice.^  Hence  this  obla- 
tion is  also  called  Lamb,  in  memory  of  our  Lord  and 
God  Jesus  Christ,  the  Lamb  of  God  who  taketh  away 
the  sins  of  the  world.*  As  for  the  remaining  four 
loaves,  they  are  disposed  of  as  follows:  from  the  first 
is  taken  out  a  part  for  the  Virgin;  from  the  second,  nine 
parts  are  taken  for  the  saints;  from  the  third,  parts  are 
taken  for  the  living;  and  from  the  fourth,  parts  are 
taken  for  the  dead,  as  you  may  see  in  the  book  of  the 
service  of  Divine  Liturgy. 

Explanation  of  the  Parts  of  the  Mass 
Kyron 

Before  beginning,  the  Priest  takes  Kyron,  which 
means  time  or  permission.  When  the  Bishop  is  present 
this  consists  of  simply  kissing  his  hand,  a  sign  of  submis- 
sion to  him  and  in  testimony  that  from  his  hand  was 
the  service  received  and  by  his  hand  fulfilled;  for  it  is 
to  the  Bishop  that  the  right  of  administering  the  Sacra- 
ments was  given.  Kissing  the  Bishop's  hand  also  signi- 
fies that  the  Priest  is  duly  ordained.  Hence  the  Priest 
must  take  from  the  Bishop  a  Kyron,  or  permission  to 
administer  the  service.  In  the  Kyron  when  the  Bishop 
is  not  present,  the  Priest  stands  in  front  of  the  Royal

Door,  then  kneels,  repeating  privately  the  prayer  of  the 
Kyron  (which  see  in  its  place),  indicating  in  it  tlTat 
under  all  conditions  he  is  Orthodox,  submitting  and 
conforming  to  all  the  commandments  of  the  holy 
Councils. 

Kissing  the  Table 

After  that,  the  Priest  enters  the  Holy  of  Holies,  or 
Sanctuary,  and  kneels  three  times  before  the  Table 
towards  the  east,  worshipping  Christ  of  the  three  Per- 
sons, and  indicating  his  love  of  God  and  union  with, 
and  his  sanctification  from  him. 

Kissing  the  Vestments 

The  Priest  then  puts  on  his  sacerdotal  vestments, 
making  the  sign  of  the  cross  oyer  each  as  he  puts  it  on, 
indicating  that  the  vestment  is  thus  sanctified  by  the 
Cross,  and  that  it  grants  its  wearer  sanctification. 

Washing  the  Hands 

This  is  followed  by  the  washing  of  the  hands,  an- 
nouncing thereby  his  own  purity  which  he  has  attained 
for  the  performance  of  this  service,  and  in  preparation 
therefor,  as  Simeon  the  Thessalonian  says,  'Tor  he  that 
comes  forward  towards  the  pure  One  must  be  himself 
pure  in  his  entirety."  Similarly  the  beatified  Germanus 
said,  ''The  washing  of  hands  among  us  Priests  is  a  re- 
minder unto  us  to  purify,  in  the  fear  of  God,  our  con- 
science, our  mind,  and  our  thoughts,  which  arc  like 
hands  to  our  souls." 

Moving  the  Oblation 

This  symbolizes  the  coming  of  Christ  to  the  grotto. 
And  after  preparing  the  holy  vessels  the  Priest  resumes 
the  order  of  the  divine  Sacrifice,  as  is  stated  in  the  serv- 
ice book  of  the  Mass  pertaining  to  the  Pries^t,

Eisodos — Infroif  or  Procession— The  Cherublcon 
and  the  Litiya 

The  holy  Church  believes,  according  to  what  has 
preceded,  that  Christ's  Death  is  the  only  true  Sacrifice, 
which  is  the  fulfillment  of  the  Sacrifice  in  behalf  of 
mankind.  It  also  believes  that  Christ's  all-pure  and  all- 
holy  Body  and  Blood,  while  offered  on  the  one  hand  for 
food  and  drink  in  the  sacramental  Supper,  are  offered 
on  the  other  hand  as  a  sacrifice  unto  God. 

Hence  the  Church  regards  the  Sacrament  of  the 
Eucharist  not  only  as  an  all-holy  Mystery  (Sacrament), 
but  also  as  a  fearful  mystical  Sacrifice,  acknowledging 
at  the  same  time,  in  a  procession  before  God,  that  this 
is  being  offered  upon  the  holy  Altar  as  a  bloodless  Sac- 
rifice of  thanksgiving  for  his  abundant  mercies  and 
countless  benevolences. 

In  order,  therefore,  to  afford  this  expression  of  our 
faith  a  proper  manifestation,  and  the  holy  Sacraments 
the  honour  of  which  they  are  worthy,  we  lift  the  Lamb 
in  a  procession,  worshipping  him  as  he  passes  by.  This 
is  what  is  meant  by  the  Eisodos,  or  Procession  with  the 
oblations  which  are  about  to  be  transformed  into  the 
holy  Body  and  the  precious  and  undefiled  Blood  of 
Christ.  This  is  what  is  known  as  the  Great  Eisodos, 
because  it  is  the  most  characteristic  part  of  the  service, 
the  greatest  in  the  noble  offering,  since  it  is  the  object 
thereof  and  through  it  the  faithful  are  sanctified  and 
united  with  the  Lord  God.  And  for  this  reason  the 
faithful  remain  standing  throughout  the  Eisodos  to  the 
tnA  of  the  Mass,  reverently  listening  to  the  prayers  and 
petitions. 

This  Eisodos  or  Procession  which  takes  place  amid 
the  awe  and  reverence  of  the  worshippers,  this  recep- 
tion of  the  divine  oblations  in  honour, fear,  and  worship, 
is  an  old  institution  which  the  Church  received  from 
the  Apostle  James,  the  Lord's  brother,  where  he  says, 
''Let  all  mortal  flesh  keep  silence  and  in  fear  and  trem- 
bling stand",  etc.     Said  Coropalatis,  the  historian  of

the  great  Church,  "The  pious  kings  of  Constantinople 
used  to  come  forward  in  a  procession  of  great  reverence 
before  this  Eisodos,  symbolizing  the  taking  down  of 
Christ's  body  from  Golgotha  by  Nicodemus  and  its 
burial  in  the  tomb  represented  by  the  holy  Table." 

In  sound  doctrine,  therefore,  the  holy  Church  or- 
dained the  singing  of  the  Cherubicon,  which  means  the 
praise  of  the  holy  cherubim,  when  the  oblations  are  car- 
ried in  the  procession,  indicating  thereby  the  entrance 
of  all  the  saints  and  the  righteous,  honouring  him  who 
is  the  Sanctification  of  the  saints,  and  the  passing  of  the 
cherubical  powers  before  him :  and  with  them  is  present 
the  Holy  Spirit,  beheld  spiritually  in  the  symbol  of 
fire  and  the  sweet  scent  of  incense.  The  Cherubicon 
also  signifies  the  casting  away  of  every  worldly  care,  in 
imitation  of  the  cherubim  and  all  the  ranks  of  angels, 
as  they  stand  in  fear  and  trembling  before  the  divine 
throne,  as  is  indicated  in  the  words  of  the  Cherubicon, 
which  had  its  origin,  according  to  the  historian  Quad- 
rinus,  in  the  reign  of  Justinian  the  Orothodox,  nephew 
of  Justinian  the  Great,  and  his  successor  in  the  year 
565.  The  Cherubicon  begins  with  the  words,  "Let  us 
who  represent  the  cherubim  mystically",  etc.  Speaking 
in  his  history  of  the  ranks  in  the  royal  palace,  Coro- 
palatis  mentions  that  at  the  singing  of  the  Cherubicon 
the  Archdeacon  of  the  church  steps  forward  and  invites 
the  king,  who  comes  forth,  accompanied  by  the  nobility 
of  his  kingdom,  and  stands  near  the  Altar,  where  the 
sacramental  Sacrifice  is  placed.  There  he  dons,  over 
his  royal  robe,  another  one^  gilded,  and  holds  a  cross  in 
his  right  hand;  for  it  was  the  custom  of  kings,  when 
they  placed  their  crowns  on  their  heads,  to  hold  a  cross 
in  the  right  hand  and  the  sceptre  in  the  left.  The  king 
then  heads  the  Eisodos,  surrounded  by  the  nobility,  and 
as  they  reach  the  Royal  Door  all  those  in  the  proces- 
sion stand  outside  the  Sanctuary,  or  Holy  of  Holies, 
except  the  king,  who  enters  through  the  Royal  Door, 
where  he  finds  the  Patriarch  standing.    Each  then  bows 


Appendices  1111 

to  the  other,  in  brotherly  love,  the  Patriarch  from  the 
inside  and  the  king  from  the  outside.  In  the  meantime 
the  Deacon,  holding  the  censer  in  his  right  hand  and 
the  Patriarch's  omophorion  in  his  left,  censes  the  king 
as  he  bows  his  head  and  in  a  loud  voice  says,  ''The  Lord 
God  remember  the  King's  majesty  in  his  kingdom  for 
evermore",  etc.  And  likewise  say  the  rest  of  the  clergy 
in  the  Eisodos,  one  by  one,  as  they  enter  the  Sanctuary. 
In  the  same  manner  they  mention  the  Patriarch,  as  they 
say,  'The  Lord  God  remember  your  High  Priesthood 
in  his  kingdom  for  evermore",  etc.  Then  the  Patriarch 
and  the  king  greet  each  other,  and  the  Patriarch  lifts 
the  gilded  robe  off  the  king  and  gives  it  to  the  church 
sexton,  according  to  the  established  custom.  The  king 
then  returns  to  his  seat  and  sits  down,  nor  does  he  stand 
up  till  the  recitation  of  the  Creed,  "I  believe  in  one 
God",  etc. 

It  should  be  well  kept  in  mind,  howbeit,  that  nowhere 
in  this  Eisodos,  or  Procession  should  the  adoration  af- 
forded the  bread  and  wine  be  considered  as  worship. 

The  Little  Eisodos  (the  Entrance) 

Besides  the  Great  Eisodos  which  we  described  above, 
there  is  another  one,  known  as  the  Little  Eisodos,  which 
is  accomplished  by  carrying  the  holy  Gospels.  This 
signifies  the  coming  of  the  Son  of  God,  and  his  holy 
entrance  into  the  world.  Hence  the  Bishop  or  Priest 
announces  this  procession  by  singing  the  Song  of  Tri- 
umph, as  he  enters  to  the  Altar,  saying,  "Come  let  us 
bow  down  and  w^orship  Christ.  Save  us,  O  Son  of 
God",  etc.,  in  accordance  with  the  words  of  the  Prophet, 
"All  the  earth  shall  worship  thee,  and  shall  sing  unto 
thee;  they  shall  sing  to  thy  Name."^  And  likewise  the 
Apostle,  "And  when  he  again  bringeth  in  the  first-born 
into  the  world  he  saith,  'And  let  the  angels  of  God  wor- 
ship him.'"' 

There  is  also  a  third  procession  with  the  branches  of 

iPs.  65:4.       2Heb.   1:6.

palm  trees.  This  takes  place  on  Palm  Sunday  and  sig- 
nifies the  reception  of  the  triumph,  and  the  joy  in  the 
Saviour  that  is  come/  Then  there  is  the  procession 
around  the  church,  as  in  the  service  of  Easter  Eve,  sig- 
nifying our  expulsion  from  paradise  because  of  disobed- 
ience. As  we  circle  the  church  we  beseech  God  to  re- 
store us  to  our  old  home,  from  which  we  were  exiled. 

As  for  the  Litiya,  it  means  a  supplicatory  hymn,  or 
processional  which  we  sing  in  the  narthex,  or  exterior 
portico,  of  the  church. 

The  procession  with  the  cross  also  reminds  us  of  the 
joy  of  salvation  which  we  received  through  the  Cruci- 
fied. 

The  Menaion 

This  is  also  known  in  Greek  as  Panthekte  which 
means  all-inclusive.  It  is  an  ecclesiastical  book  of  songs 
which  contains  the  services  of  all  the  dominical  feasts, 
the  feasts  of  the  Theotokos  and  of  all  the  celebrated 
saints,  as  well  as  the  daily  remembrances  of  the  rest 
of  the  saints  throughout  the  twelve  months.  It  is  put  in 
rhyme,  and  was  composed  by  several  saints. 

Needless  to  say  that  in  poetical  composition,  in  which 
the  composer  has  to  preserve  the  meter  and  rhyme,  al- 
though in  the  Greek  language  the  latter  is  dispensed 
with,  certain  things  are  permissible.  Hence  in  the 
Greek  text  of  such  a  book  often  occur  many  words  in 
their  symbolical  or  hyperbolical  senses,  and  not  the 
literal  one,  such  as  the  work  ousia,  which  means  essence 
or  element,  for  the  word  phusis,  which  figuratively 
means  nature.  Synonyms  and  sometimes  repetitions  are 
used  in  the  same  song,  especially  in  the  vocative  case, 
for  no  reason  than  the  necessity  of  the  rhyme. 

Trio  J  ion 

A  great  number  of  God-mantled  saints,  who  sang  of 
divine  things,  were  moved   by  the   Holy  Spirit  and 

iLev.   23:40;  St.  Mt.  21:8;  St.  Jn.    12:13  and  Rev.  7:9. 


Appendices  1113 

moved  by  divine  longing,  to  write  and  compose  hymns 
for  the  guidance  of  the  faithful.  Foremost  among  these 
was  St.  Cosma,  the  great  composer;  for  this  saint,  realiz- 
ing that  glory  and  honour  are  meet  unto  the  Holy  Spirit, 
as  they  are  meet  unto  the  Father  and  the  Son,  invented 
the  Triodion,  which  means  a  song  of  three  odes,  sym- 
bolizing the  most  Holy  Trinity,  the  essence  of  life. 

These  odes  are  sung  in  the  great  and  holy  Passion 
Week  of  our  Lord  and  God  Jesus  Christ.  The  com- 
poser originated  the  tunes  after  the  opening  words  of 
the  Troparia,  after  the  naming  almost  of  each  day. 
Others  of  the  Fathers,  especially  Theodore  and  Joseph, 
then  imitated  St.  Cosma,  composing  hymns  for  the  rest 
of  the  holy  and  great  weeks  of  Quadragesima.  These 
they  delivered  in  their  own  monastery  first,  after  they 
were  put  in  the  best  order,  as  relating  to  the  Odes  and 
the  quotations  they  made  from  the  Fathers. 

And  since  Sunday  includes  the  first  day,  being  the  day 
of  Resurrection,  and  the  eighth  and  last,  they  did  well 
in  assigning  to  the  second  day,  which  is  Monday,  the 
first  of  the  songs  of  praise,  to  the  third  the  second,  to 
the  fourth  the  third,  to  the  fifth  the  fourth,  to  the  sixth 
the  fifth,  and  the  seventh,  which  is  Saturday,  the  sixth 
with  the  two  remaining  songs,  in  which  all  the  days  in 
a  more  special  way  share.  Then,  too,  the  noble  Cosma, 
composed  a  canon  of  four  odes,  which  he  designated  for 
Great  Saturday,  even  though  the  very  wise  King  Leo 
ordered  that  this  canon  be  completed  by  the  anchorite 
Marcus,  Bishop  of  Idropidus.  This,  however,  only 
figuratively  is  called  a  Triodion,  for  it  does  not  always 
comprise  canons  of  three  odes,  but  sometimes  complete 
odes.  Hence  Nicepherus  of  Calithtus  presumes  that  this 
nomenclature  was  adopted  from  the  more  prevailing 
name,  or  because  of  what  takes  place  on  Great  Friday, 
as  we  said. 

The  object  of  the  whole  Tridion,  therefore,  which 
our  holy  Fathers  had  in  mind  was  to  remind  us  in  a 
brief  and  figurative  manner  of  the  lovingkindnesses  of 


1114  Appendices 

God,  which  accrued  to  us  from  the  beginning:  how  we 
were  created;  how  we  disobeyed  the  commandment 
which  was  given  us  to  observe;  how  we  were  expelled 
from  the  paradise  of  bliss;  how  we  were  kept  afar  be- 
cause of  the  envy  of  the  serpent,  which  is  the  foe,  who 
is  the  source  of  evil  since  his  downfall  from  heaven  be- 
cause of  his  haughtiness;  how  we  were  cast  away  and 
denied  the  blessings;  and  how  we  were  led  away  by 
Satan.  They  also  remind  us  how  the  Son  of  God  and 
his  Word  had  compassion  on  us,  moved  by  anguish  for 
us,  how  he  bowed  the  heavens  and  came  down,  dwell- 
ing in  the  Virgin's  womb,  how  he  became  Man  for  our 
sake,  and  by  his  undefiled  conduct  revealed  unto  us  the 
ascent  to  heaven,  first  through  his  humility,  through 
fasting,  abstaining  from  evil,  and  the  rest  of  his  glor- 
ious deeds,  how  he  suffered  and  rose  and  ascended  into 
heaven,  how  he  sent  the  Holy  Spirit  to  his  holy  Dis- 
ciples, how  these  preached  him  among  all  nations,  that 
he  was  the  Son  of  God  and  perfect  God,  and  of  what 
those  divine  Disciples  did  by  the  grace  of  the  all-holy 
Spirit,  in  that  they  brought  together  from  the  ends  of 
the  earth,  by  their  warning,  all  the  saints,  thus  complet- 
ing the  upper  world,  which  was  of  old  the  purpose  of 
the  Creator. 

Synaxarion 

The  Holy  Church,  desiring  to  reveal  to  us  the  divine 
perfections  which  are  commanded  by  God,^  embodied 
by  practise  in  the  persons  of  the  men  of  God,  placed 
before  the  eyes  of  her  sons  the  Synaxarions,  which 
means  a  collection  of  the  accounts  of  the  saints  of  God. 
In  this  book  the  Church  pictured  the  lives  of  the  saints, 
and  the  content  of  each  of  their  feasts,  from  which  the 
purpose  of  the  feast  is  clearly  shown,  and  when  and 
how  it  was  appointed  of  old,  along  with  the  reason  for 
this  appointment,  with  special  reference  to  what  we 
have  already  said  of  the  Triodions.    The  Synaxarions

Appendices  HIS 

begin  with  the  Sunday  of  the  Pharisee  and  the  Publi- 
can, and  end  with  the  Sunday  of  All  Saints.  (See  the 
Synaxarions  and  the  Sundays  of  the  Triodion.) 

SUNDAY 

The  Holy  Book  says  that  God  the  Father,  by  his 
Son,  began  on  the  first  day,  which  is  Sunday,  with  the 
creation  of  the  sensible  world,  and  ended  his  work  on 
the  sixth,  resting  on  the  seventh. 

For  this  reason  the  seventh  day  was  called  sabbath, 
which  in  Hebrew  (shabbath)  means  rest  and  quiet. 
This  seventh  day  begins  on  Friday  evening  (sunset)  and 
ends  on  Saturday  evening,  according  to  the  Jewish 
custom. 

Now  since  the  whole  of  creation  consisted  of  the 
purely  spiritual,  as  the  angels,  and  the  purely  sensible 
as  matter,  God  united  both  by  creating  man  of  both.  And 
since  God  created  man  partly  of  enduring  and  partly 
of  unenduring  elements,  and  this  he  did  not  for  a  tem- 
poral and  transient  end,  but  for  an  everlasting  and 
permanent  end,  this  being  far  superior  to  that,  he  made 
his  soul  especially  after  his  divine  likeness  and  holy 
image.  He  singled  him  out  of  all  creatures  for  the 
honour  of  imitating  him.  And  as  a  result  of  creating 
man's  body,  God  appointed  the  Sabbath  for  rest. 

Thus,  God  (may  he  be  exalted)  commanded  man  to 
do  what  is  best  in  his  eyes,  which  is  to  follow  him  and 
imitate  him,  and  to  rest  from  his  w^orks,  as  God  rested 
from  his,  thus  perpetuating  the  remembrance  of  his 
having  been  created  and  fashioned  by  him  as  well  as 
the  fact  that  God  worked  and  rested  from  his  work, 
which  to  God  signifies  the  end  of  the  work  of  creation. 
To  man,  however,  it  means  actually  rest  for  one  day 
after  six  days  of  work,  in  order  to  find  time  for  the  ful- 
fillment of  spiritual  activities,  such  as  prayer,  the  var- 
ious rites  of  worship  and  sacrifices  and  other  religious 
duties.  The  rest  on  the  sabbath  is  not  an  end  of  the 
commandment  in  itself,  but  was  instituted  for  the  added 


1116

good  of  man,  physically  and  spiritually.  So  that,  hav- 
ing accomplished  the  duty  of  worship  towards  his  Cre- 
ator, he  may  be  granted  blessing  and  sanctification,  in 
that  God  by  blessing  and  sanctifying  (hallowing)  the 
seventh  day,  made  those  who  keep  it  to  be  also  blessed 
and  sanctified,^  until  the  time  it  was  to  be  changed,  as 
the  Apostle  said,  ''Which  was  a  figure  for  the  time  then 
present,  in  which  were  offered  both  gifts  and  sacrifices, 
that  could  not  make  him  that  did  the  service  perfect, 
as  pertaining  to  the  conscience;  which  stood  only  in 
meats  and  drinks,  and  divers  washings,  and  carnal  ordi- 
nances, imposed  on  them  until  the  time  of  reforma- 
tion."' 

In  addition  to  this,  God  later  designated  the  sabbath 
as  a  symbol  of  the  rest  in  the  promised  land.^ 

When,  therefore,  the  beauty  of  creation  was  oblit- 
erated by  submission  to  error,  and  the  splendour  of 
God's  likeness  was  blotted  out  by  disobedience,  and  the 
sanctify  of  the  spiritual  attribute  was  marred  by  rebel- 
lion, God  the  Father  sent  his  Son,  by  whom  he  had 
made  creation/  incarnate  from  an  immaculate  Virgin, 
in  order  to  restore  what  had  been  obliterated  and  to 
renew  what  had  been  destroyed.^ 

But  this  renewal  does  not  signify  the  creation  of  new 
things  (for  that  had  been  done  and  accomplished,  and 
God  rested  therefrom  on  the  seventh  day),  but  a 
work  of  love  and  providence,  as  he  said,  "My  Father 
worketh  hitherto,  and  I  work."  ^ 

And  in  order  to  confirm  the  fact  that  he  is  the  Cre- 
ator, the  Lawgiver,  and  the  Commander  of  old  and  new, 
he  said,  "Ye  have  heard  that  it  was  said  by  them  of  old 
time.  .  .  .  But  I  say  unto  you."  '  Then  concerning  the 
sabbath  and  the  annulment  of  its  law,  he  said,  "Or  have 
ye  not  read  in  the  law,  how  that  on  the  sabbath  days  the 
priests   in   the   temple   profane   the   sabbath,    and    are

blameless?  ^  Then  he  added,  *'For  the  Son  of  Man  is 
Lord  even  of  the  sabbath  day."  And  that,  ''The  sab- 
bath was  made  for  man."  Likewise  the  Apostle,  hav- 
ing observed  this,  said  in  contravening  the  keeping  of 
the  sabbath,  "Let  no  man  therefore  judge  you  in  meat, 
or  in  drink,  or  in  respect  of  a  holy  day,  or  of  the  new 
moon,  or  of  the  sabbath  days:  which  are  a  shadow  of 
things  to  come;  for  the  body  is  of  Christ." - 

Yea,  these  things  have  become  void  with  the  existence 
of  the  new  law  of  truth,  'Tor",  as  the  Apostle  says,  "if 
that  which  is  done  away  was  glorious,  much  more  that 
which  remaineth  is  glorious,"'^  yea,  infinitely  more 
glorious. 

This  did  Christ  do  and  teach  (to  his  Name  be  wor- 
ship), in  order  to  prepare  the  way  for  a  new  creation 
and  a  new  law,  as  the  Apostle  also  said,  "Therefore  if 
any  man  be  in  Christ,  he  is  a  new  creature;  old  things 
are  passed  away;  behold,  all  things  are  become  new."^ 
This  is  natural;  for  it  was  not  possible  to  retain  the  old 
order  when  the  new  order  had  set  in,  as  the  Apostle  says, 
"In  that  he  saith,  a  new  covenant,  he  hath  made  the 
first  old.  Now  that  which  decayeth  and  waxeth  old  is 
ready  to  vanish  away."' 

Hence  when  he  wished  to  begin  the  work  of  spiritual 
creation,  the  renewal  of  the  likeness  of  the  soul  of  man, 
which  had  been  corrupted,  and  to  restore  it  to  the  like- 
ness of  its  former  sanctification  and  the  beauty  of  its 
splendour,  to  restore  its  unity  with  God  its  Creator  in 
his  heavenly  kingdom,  which  he  had  prepared  for  it 
"from  the  foundation  of  the  world,"  ^'  he  walked  in  the 
steps  of  his  Father,  "For  what  things  soever  he  doeth, 
these  also  doeth  the  Son  likewise."  ^ 

And  as  God  the  Father  began  the  creation  of  the 
sensible  world  on  the  first  day,  which  is  Sunday,  so  the 
Son  also  be^^an  the  work  of  the  spiritual  creation  on  the

first  day,  which  is  Palm  Sunday,  in  which  began  his 
struggles  of  salvation.  And  as  the  Father  was  finished 
with  creation  on  the  sixth  day  and  rested  on  the  seventh 
day,  so  the  Son  finished  the  spiritual  creation  on  the 
sixth  day,  Thursday  evening,  and  rested  physically  in 
the  tomb  on  the  seventh  day. 

And  again,  as  it  was  the  Father's  purpose  in  creating 
man  to  unite  him  with  himself  everlastingly,  so  it  was 
the  purpose  of  the  Son  in  the  renewal  of  man's  creation 
to  restore  him  to  the  state  from  which  he  had  fallen, 
and  to  make  him  partaker  of  his  eternal  bliss  and  to 
enjoy  him  for  ever.^ 

Now  since  the  first  rest  of  the  sabbath  took  place 
after  the  creation  of  the  sensible  universe  and  later  be- 
came a  symbol  for  the  rest  of  the  promised  land,  so  the 
rest  of  the  second  sabbath  took  place  after  the  spiritual 
creation  and  became  a  symbol  of  the  land  of  the  meek 
in  the  heavenly  homeland.  Similarly  as  after  the  first 
creation  and  the  first  sabbath  the  old  law  was  given,  the 
old  rites  were  instituted,  and  the  Old  Covenant  pledged, 
so  after  the  spiritual  creation  the  law  of  the  New  Cove- 
nant, with  all  its  new  rites  and  institutions,  was  given; 
for  it  was  on  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  Sunday,  that 
Christ  said  to  his  Disciples,  ''All  power  is  given  unto 
me  in  heaven  and  on  earth :  as  my  Father  hath  sent  me, 
even  so  send  I  you.  Go  ye,  therefore,  into  all  the 
world,  and  preach  the  gospel  to  every  creature.  He  that 
believeth  and  is  baptized  shall  be  saved;  but  he  that 
believeth  not  shall  be  damned."  ^ 

The  undcfiled  Disciples,  therefore,  in  remembrance 
of  this  divine  appearance  on  Sunday,  on  which  the  Sav- 
iour established  the  greatest  doctrine  of  faith,  belief  in 
resurrection,  proclaimed  what  he  had  commanded 
them;  for  it  was  on  that  day,  too,  that  the  perfection 
of  human  nature  took  place,  as  in  the  Incarnation  of 
God  the  Word  the  grace  of  the  remission  of  sins  was

given;  for  it  was  by  his  Resurrection  on  the  first  day 
of  the  week,  Sunday,  that  human  nature  was  given  the 
perfection  of  salvation,  and  life  eternal  in  the  world  to 
come,  as  they  had  been  assured  before  and  had  heard  it 
from  his  teachings  and  now  beheld  it  after  his  Passion, 
Death,  and  Resurrection. 

Then  to  confirm  to  his  Disciples  the  necessity  of  ob- 
serving the  first  day  as  a  remembrance  of  his  Resurrec- 
tion, and  to  assure  them  that  the  first  day  has  been  sub- 
stituted for  the  sabbath,  as  the  law  of  the  New  Cove- 
nant has  been  substituted  for  the  old,  he  appeared  to 
them  a8:ain  on  Sunday, eight  days  after  his  Resurrection, 
thus  reiterating  the  belief  in  his  Resurrection,  and  re- 
minding them  of  its  great  benefits,^  commanding  them 
to  tarry  in  Jerusalem  and  to  await  there  the  descent  of 
the  Holy  Spirit,  as  he  had  said,  and  according  to  the 
Father's  promise.^ 

As  for  the  Disciples,  not  knowing  the  day  on  which 
they  were  to  receive  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Spirit  of  wis- 
dom and  understanding,  the  Spirit  of  power  through 
which  they  were  to  preach  his  law,  beginning  at  Jeru- 
salem,'^ they  continued  in  one  accord  with  prayers  and 
supplications,  praising  God  and  blessing  him  by  offer- 
ing the  Sacrament  of  the  Eucharist  and  the  other  Sac- 
raments in  his  remembrance,  as  he  had  commanded 
them,  when  he  said,  ''Do  ye  this  in  remembrance  of 
me."  At  that  same  time  they  used  to  go  frequently  to 
the  Temple. 

Thus  they  w^aited  and  hoped  for  the  Holy  Spirit  un- 
til he  descended  upon  them  fifty  days  after  his  Resur- 
rection, which  also  falls  on  Sunday.  Thus  by  his  de- 
scent upon  them  on  Sunday  the  Holy  Spirit  also  im- 
posed on  them  the  keeping  of  Sunday,  in  confirmation 
of  which  we  have  sundry  references  and  evidences.  We 
shall  now  mention  a  few  of  these,  recapitulating  those 
we  have  already  mentioned :

God  the  Word,  before  his  Incarnation,  made  creation 
on  the  first  day,  Sunday,  then  renewed  it  after  his  Incar- 
nation by  his  Resurrection  on  Sunday.  He  proclaimed 
the  joy  of  salvation  to  the  women  on  Sunday,  saying  to 
them,  "Rejoice",  thus  annulling  the  curse  and  sorrow 
of  the  fall  of  mankind.  Then  he  appeared  to  his  Dis- 
ciples on  Sunday,  and  commanded  them  to  preach  his 
New  Covenant.  Afterwards  he  sent  to  them  the  Holy 
Spirit  on  Sunday,  confirming  his  own  holy  Resurrec- 
tion, fulfilling  his  divine  promise,  and  reassuring  the 
hopes  of  his  undefiled  Apostles.  At  the  same  time  he 
pointed  out  to  them  that  the  Jewish  Passover  has  been 
fulfilled  by  his  own  Passover  of  salvation.  In  the  same 
manner  the  Jewish  Pentecost,  which  is  the  fiftieth  day 
after  the  Passover,  was  fulfilled  by  the  sending  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  on  that  day,  fifty  days  after  his  Resurrec- 
tion; for,  as  on  that  day  the  Jews  eat  bread  made  of  new 
wheat,  recalling  their  substitution  of  bread  for  manna 
and  thus  remembering  their  entrance  into  the  land  of 
promise,^  so  by  partaking  of  the  heavenly  bread  in  our 
spiritual  and  bloodless  Sacrifice,  we  commemorate  our 
entrance  into  heaven  by  his  Resurrection. 

This  being  the  case,  Sunday,  the  day  of  the  Lord's 
Resurrection,  became  known  as  the  Lord's  Day,  of 
which  the  Psalmist  sang,  ^'This  is  the  day  which  the 
Lord  hath  made;  we  will  rejoice  and  be  glad  in  it."^ 
Yes,  it  is  the  first  day  in  creation,  the  first  in  rank,  the 
first  in  importance,  the  first  in  the  gifts  we  received 
thereon,  and  first  in  the  proclamation  of  God's  love  and 
mercy  which  became  man's  by  the  Resurrection  of  the 
Saviour,  and  by  the  attainment  of  human  nature,  the 
everlasting  glory  and  kingdom. 

For  this  reason  the  holy  Apostles  kept  Sunday  and 
sanctified  it  with  the  greatest  sanctification,  by  using  it 
for  the  teaching  of  the  Faith,'^  celebrating  the  Sacrament 
of  the  Eucharist,  consisting  of  the  breaking  of  bread,'' 
as  they  also  carried  on  their  works  of  mercy,  love,  and

bounty,   and  the  partaking  together  of  the  undefiled 
Sacraments.^ 

In  their  path  followed  the  holy  Church  after  them. 
She  commanded  that  Sunday  be  kept,  ordaining  for  it 
special  prayers,  services,  and  rites.  The  Roman  writer 
Pliny  in  his  letter  to  Trajan  Caesar  wrote  that  Chris- 
tians had  a  custom  of  meeting  on  a  certain  day  and  of 
singing  hymns  to  Christ  as  to  a  God.  While  Justin 
Martyr,  wrote  that  on  the  Day  of  the  Sun  the  Christian 
people  of  the  cities  and  towns  would  meet  and  read  the 
Epistles  of  the  Apostles  or  the  books  of  the  Prophets, 
and  after  reading,  an  elder  would  preach  a  sermon, 
"Then  we  rise  up  together  and  pray;  and  after  the 
prayer,  bread  and  wine  and  water  are  offered,  and  the 
elder  administers  the  Eucharist,  while  the  people  re- 
spond with,  ^'Amen."  Then  Justin  adds,  'We  meet  on 
the  Day  of  the  Sun  because  it  is  the  first  day  on  which 
God  made  the  world,  and  on  it  rose  our  Saviour  from 
the  dead."  Later,  King  Constantine,  who  is  equal  to 
the  Apostles,  issued  an  edict  throughout  his  kingdom 
forbidding  litigation  on  the  Day  of  the  Sun,  which  is 
honoured  by  all,  and  calls  upon  the  people  to  keep 
their  holy  vows  and  other  religious  duties.  Then  Em- 
peror Justinian  forbade  litigation  on  the  seven  holy 
days  preceding  Easter,  Passion  Week,  and  the  seven 
that  follow  it,  the  New  Week,  on  Christmas,  the  Epi- 
phany, the  days  of  the  Passion  of  the  Apostles,  and  the 
days  of  the  Sun  which  are  celebrated  every  week,  and 
which  are  truly  called  the  days  of  the  Lord.  On  all 
these  days  it  was  forbidden  to  hold  trials  whether 
before  an  arbiter  or  before  a  judge.  Also  officers  in 
the  army  were  excused  from  service  on  Sundays  and 
other  holidays;  for  Eusebius  of  Caesarea  mentions  that 
Constantine  the  Great  used  to  urge  all  his  soldiers  to 
keep  the  Day  of  the  Sun,  or  Sunday;  and  those  of  them 
who  were  worthy  to  be  participants  in  the  divine  faith 
he  released  in  order  that  they  might  spend  the  vigils  in 

1  1  Cor.  16:1-2.    Acts  20:7,   11.

the  church  of  God,  and  should  not  stand  in  the  way  of 
their  performance  of  religious  services.  Similarly  he 
released  day  labourers  and  civil  servants  from  their 
labours  on  Sundays.  Thus  all  Christians  who  were 
employed  in  public  offices  were  released  from  work  on 
Sundays  and  holidays.  And  St.  John  Chrysostom  calls 
Sunday  the  day  of  special  benevolences,  in  relation  to 
other  days  of  the  week. 


PASSOVER  (EASTER) 

The  most  celebrated  of  Hebrew  festivals  was  the 
Passover,  which  means  literally  the  feast  of  passing 
over.  In  fact  it  represents  two  festivals,  indicating  two 
events,  the  first  of  which  was  the  Passover  itself  and  the 
other  was  the  seven  Days  of  Unleavened  Bread.  The 
Passover  was  a  memorial  of  the  deliverance  of  the  first- 
born sons  of  the  Israelites  when  the  first-born  of  the 
Egyptians  were  killed  by  the  angel  of  the  Lord,  as  it 
was  a  symbol  of  the  Sacrifice  of  the  Saviour,  which  he 
fulfilled  on  the  Cross.  But  the  Days  of  Unleavened 
Bread  were  a  memorial  of  the  exodus  of  the  children 
of  Israel  from  Egypt,  and  their  carrying  their  dough 
in  a  hurry  before  it  was  leavened. 

The  two  events  were  comprised  in  the  seven  Days  of 
Unleavened  Bread,  on  the  first  of  which  they  held  the 
memorial  of  the  deliverance  of  their  first-born  which 
was  called  Passover,  or  the  passing  over  of  the  angel 
from  the  homes  of  the  Israelites  when  the  first-born  of 
the  Egyptians  were  killed,  and  their  own  first-born  were 
saved. ^  Hence  the  holy  Fathers  ordained  that  Chris- 
tians should  not  celebrate  the  same  day  of  Passover  as 
the  Jews,  neither  on  the  day  it  fell,  nor  on  the  day  pre- 
ceding it,  lest  the  reality  come  before  the  shadow,  the 
true  Sacrifice  of  Christ  for  salvation  before  the  sacrifice 
of  the  Jewish  paschal  lamb.

PENTECOST 

This  was  a  feast  which  the  Jews  celebrated  on  the 
sixteenth  day  of  the  month  of  Siwan  (June),  or  the 
fiftieth  day  after  the  second  day  of  the  Passover  which 
fell  on  the  sixteenth  of  Abib,  or  April.  They  also  called 
it  the  Feast  of  Weeks,  because  seven  weeks  from  Easter 
passed  before  it  came.  The  Greeks  gave  it  the  name 
Pentecost,  which  means  the  Fiftieth  Day  (after  the 
Passover).'  The  Jews  celebrated  it  in  remembrance  of 
the  law  which  w^as  given  to  them  at  the  hands  of  Moses 
on  that  day  on  Mount  Sinai.  The  Holy  Church  of 
Christ,  however,  celebrates  it  in  remembrance  of  the 
descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  fifty  days  after  the  Resurrec- 
tion of  Christ.  The  Arabic  name,  Ansarah  is  Hebrew 
in  origin  and  means  congregation,  because  on  that  day 
people  congregated  from  distant  places. 

THE  CHURCH  BELL 

The  use  of  the  bell  in  the  holy  Church  to  call  the  peo- 
ple to  prayer  was  foretold  in  the  use  of  horns  by  the 
Jews  to  call  the  congregation. - 

LEAVE-TAKING  OF  FEASTS 

The  holy  Church  celebrates  the  Leave-Taking,  as 
well  as  welcoming  of  the  holy  feasts,  following  the 
command  which  God  gave  his  servant  Moses,  in  that 
the  beginning  and  the  end  of  the  festivals  should  be 
celebrated  in  a  holy  convocation.'' 

And  unto  God  be  thanks  at  the  beginning  and  at  the 
end.
